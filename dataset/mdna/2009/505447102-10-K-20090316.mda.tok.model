item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the financial statements and the notes to such statements included elsewhere in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to those discussed in risk factors set forth in item a of this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
executive overview for the year ended december   our us gaap net loss was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the same period in these gaap results were affected by significant unrealized losses of million in and million in in connection with the change in value of our nyx shares  million in expenses on our early extinguishment of debt in and in impairment charges related to our goodwill and stock listing rights in excluding these items in each year  our pro forma net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to pro forma net income for the year ended december  of million  or per share 
virtually all of the markets in which we provide liquidity experienced significantly higher levels of volatility in the third and fourth quarters of  with periods of extreme volatility in september and october 
although we do not expect that these levels of extreme volatility will continue to be sustained  we do believe that these volatile conditions and market imbalances in the third and fourth quarters of evidence that there is a continued need for  and at times  opportunities for profitability for market makers  which is where our expertise and history of committing capital has generated most of our revenues 
the market environment to date in has weakened significantly  with reductions in volume and volatility on the exchanges on which we compete  and our market making business operations have been adversely affected by these changes 
however  we believe that if volatility and market imbalances continue to occur  our liquid balance sheet puts us in a strong position to provide added liquidity in securities markets 
in the third and fourth quarters of  our newer business lines  such as options and etfs market making in the united states and the united kingdom  performed extremely well and constituted a substantial majority of our revenues 
our traditional cash equities specialist business posted its best results during the second half of since the introduction of the nyse s hybrid market 
in addition  the steps we have taken in reducing costs and overhead during past years enabled us to improve margins and cash flows at our operating companies throughout the recent convergence of new trading venues and global securities markets have meant that there is less concentration of trading in one market over another  and trading opportunities are becoming more fragmented 
therefore  our strategy has been  and will continue to be  looking for opportunities in markets outside our traditional cash equities dmm business 
our newer businesses are continuing to grow as a percentage of our market making segment revenues  especially as we rely upon and further develop our electronic trading strategies to interact with the global electronic marketplace 
in addition  we are seeking additional opportunities to build our institutional brokerage business 
although our institutional brokerage segment showed a loss in  we believe that start up costs and our initial facilitation trading results contributed to the bulk of these losses 
our sales trading revenues in the institutional brokerage revenues have increased significantly as we have made key hires of sales and position traders and increased market trading in over the counter and pink sheets securities 
we are in the process of commencing a fixed income business in the first quarter of  which is expected to be focused on sales and positional trading of bank and credit bank loans 
we believe this business will be the next step in leveraging our market trading philosophies and expertise  while expanding the menu of our services to meet the needs and provide more diverse products to our institutional customers 
in  we successfully reduced our operating expenses  the most significant of which was the interest on our public debt 
we repurchased approximately million of our public debt in  which reduced our annual interest payments related to this debt from million in to approximately million by the end of these repurchases of our public debt and our third and fourth quarter performance also has enabled us to improve our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio to at december   which allows us to be much more flexible in how we deploy our capital under the terms of the indenture governing our remaining outstanding indebtedness 
historically  the operating expense related to our outstanding debt has been the negative carry on our debt  which is the interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness  less the interest income we receive as a result of having that cash on hand 
prior to the repurchases described above  our negative carry would have been million per quarter  based on current short term interest rates 
following our repurchases in  the negative carry was reduced to approximately million per quarter  based on current short term interest rates 
as we have explained in the past  our ownership of million shares of nyse euronext inc common stock the nyx shares resulted from the exchange of our exchange memberships  or seats in connection with the nyse s mergers and we believed that our seat ownership was integral to our position in the industry 
though the value of our nyx shares has been volatile over the past two years  the value of our seats prior to their exchange were volatile as well 
our management will remain flexible regarding our continued ownership of nyx shares 
we are also mindful that our ownership of exchange seats and exchange related securities  such as our nyx shares  have been beneficial to our company over time 
our balance sheet is still strong and very liquid despite the continued decline in price of or nyx shares and despite the decline in market conditions to date in we believe we have ample capital to maintain and grow our business 
we are continuing to concentrate on building our business in london and hong kong  in which we see trading opportunities in those markets in etfs and other products 
our market making segment is in a period of significant transition during the first quarter of  due to the implementation of the nyse s new market model  turnover in senior management in our options market making business and poor market conditions 
our trading results in this period of transition have been significantly adversely affected due to these circumstances  as more fully described below 
coupled with the continued decline of our nyx shares to date in  we currently expect to report a gaap and pro forma loss in the first quarter of in december  the nyse implemented its new market model  changing the name of specialists to dmms  who will still provide liquidity  but without the bulk of the negative and affirmative obligations that existed prior to the change 
the rule changes would modify the timing of when the dmm can see orders  but could provide flexibility in the timing and occasions in which we can trade 
it is still early in the new market model process to determine the actual effects it can have on our profitability for the long run  but extremely poor market conditions and significantly lower volumes since the new market model became effective has adversely affected our market making revenues to date in the first quarter of one possible outcome of the new market model is that some of the restraints on our ability to trade and manage our risk will be lessened 
the timing and effect of these rule changes are not certain and we  therefore  cannot predict the outcome of these changes 
however  the new market model is requiring us to redesign our trading algorithms and technology 
to date in the first quarter of  our trading revenues have significantly declined  and we cannot yet be sure if these results have declined due to poor market conditions or the change in market structure 
in january  we announced the departure of the head of our options trading unit and chief investment officer of lsp 
this was a significant departure for us  since he had helped build our options market making business through a period of significant growth 
in february  we entered into employment agreements with two individuals formerly employed by a major wall street firm to become co heads of our options trading unit 
these individuals will begin employment early in april during this period of transition  we have temporarily reduced our options market making activity and pared back our positions pending the commencement of their employment 
poor market conditions and these trading activities have resulted in trading losses that have adversely affected our financial results during the first quarter of new accounting developments fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas nullifies the guidance in eitf which precluded the recognition of a trading profit at the inception of a derivative contract  unless the fair value of such derivative is obtained from a quoted market price  or other valuation technique incorporating observable market data 
sfas also precludes the use of a liquidity or block discount  when measuring instruments traded in an active market at fair value 
sfas requires that costs related to acquiring financial instruments carried at fair value should not be capitalized  but rather should be expensed as incurred 
sfas also clarifies that an issuer s credit standing should be considered when measuring liabilities at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and was adopted by us as of january  sfas must be applied prospectively  except that the provisions related to block discounts and the guidance in eitf are to be applied as a one time cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the first interim period for the fiscal year in which sfas is initially applied 
the adoption of sfas resulted in no cumulative change to the accumulated deficit 
please refer to footnote of our consolidated financial statements for additional information and disclosure 
in february  the fasb issued fsp fas which delays the effective date of statement to all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entity s financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  such items include a nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase business combinations and b intangible assets and goodwill 
in october of  the fasb issued fsp fas which clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
the fsp shall be effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
revisions resulting from a change in the valuation technique or its application shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate pursuant to fasb the disclosure provisions of statement for a change in accounting estimate are not required for revisions resulting from a change in valuation technique or its application 
as of december   we do not hold any securities that would be subject to change based on fsp fas accounting for fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we currently report the majority of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in compliance with industry guidelines for brokers and dealers in securities 
we elected not to apply the fair value option for any applicable assets or liabilities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in april  the fasb issued a staff position fsp fin no 
 amendment of fasb interpretation no 
fsp fin no 
defines right of setoff and specifies what conditions must be met for a derivative contract to qualify for this right of setoff 
it also addresses the applicability of a right of setoff to derivative instruments and clarifies the circumstances in which it is appropriate to offset amounts recognized for those instruments in the statement of financial position 
in addition  this fsp permits offsetting of fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral a receivable or the obligation to return cash collateral a payable arising from the same master netting arrangement as the derivative instruments 
the provisions of this fsp are consistent with our current accounting practice 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early application permitted 
the adoption of fsp fin no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement 
sfas amends and expands the disclosures required by sfas so that they provide an enhanced understanding of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas and its related interpretations  and how derivative instruments affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for both interim and annual reporting periods beginning after november   with early adoption encouraged 
we are not subject to sfas at this time 
since this amendment relates solely to disclosures related to sfas  there is no potential effect on our financial position 
the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states the gaap hierarchy 
sfas is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates goodwill and other intangible assets we determine the fair value of each of our reporting units and the fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in determining fair value  we use standard analytical approaches to business enterprise valuation bev  such as the market comparable approach and the income approach 
the market comparable approach is based on comparisons of the subject company to similar companies engaged in an actual merger or acquisition or to public companies whose stocks are actively traded 
as part of this process  multiples of value relative to financial variables  such as earnings or stockholders equity  are developed and applied to the appropriate financial variables of the subject company to indicate its value 
the income approach involves estimating the present value of the subject company s future cash flows by using projections of the cash flows that the business is expected to generate  and discounting these cash flows at a given rate of return 
each of these bev methodologies requires the use of management estimates and assumptions 
for example  under the market comparable approach  we assigned a certain control premium to the public market price of our common stock as of the valuation date in estimating the fair value of our specialist reporting unit 
similarly  under the income approach  we assumed certain growth rates for our revenues  expenses  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  returns on working capital  returns on other assets and capital expenditures  among others 
we also assumed certain discount rates and certain terminal growth rates in our calculations 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of the fair value of our goodwill 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying value of our goodwill annually as of december  unless an event or change in circumstances requires an interim reassessment of impairment 
during the year ended december   there were no changes in circumstances that necessitated goodwill impairment testing prior to our required year end test date 
we cannot provide assurance that a change in circumstances requiring an interim assessment or future goodwill impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods 
another of our intangible assets  as defined under sfas no 
 is our trade name 
we determine the fair value of our trade name by applying the income approach using the royalty savings methodology 
this method assumes that the trade name has value to the extent we are relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from it 
application of this methodology requires estimating an appropriate royalty rate  which is typically expressed as a percentage of revenue 
estimating an appropriate royalty rate includes reviewing evidence from comparable licensing agreements and considering qualitative factors affecting the trade name 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of fair value of our trade name 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying amount of our trade name on an annual basis in conjunction with our goodwill impairment assessment 
during the year ended december   there were no changes in circumstances that necessitated trade name impairment testing prior to our required year end test date 
we cannot provide assurance that a change in circumstances requiring an interim assessment or future trade name and stock listing rights impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods 
financial instruments financial instruments owned  at fair value and financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value are reported in our consolidated financial statements  at fair value  on a recurring basis 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability  or the exit price  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
outlines a fair value hierarchy that is used to determine the value to be reported 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities which are considered level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs which are considered level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas no 
are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions would reflect our own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
such valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
non marketable securities the measurement of non marketable securities is a critical accounting estimate 
investments in non marketable securities consist of investments in equity securities of private companies and limited liability company interests and are included in other assets in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition 
certain investments in non marketable securities are initially carried at cost  unless there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
for certain other investments in non marketable securities we adjust their carrying value by applying the equity method of accounting pursuant to apb under the equity method the investor recognizes its share of the earnings and losses of an investee in the periods for which they are reported by the investee in its financial statements 
the assets included in this section represent limited liability companies that are service providers and whose value is affected by nonfinancial components 
in addition  if and when available  management considers other relevant factors relating to non marketable securities in estimating their value  such as the financial performance of the entity  its cash flow forecasts  trends within that entity s industry and any specific rights associated with our investment such as conversion features among others 
non marketable investments are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that such investment s carrying value may be impaired 
use of estimates the use of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
see legal proceedings in part ii  item of this quarterly report on form q for information on our judicial  regulatory and arbitration proceedings 
recent regulatory developments regulation sho and short selling rules 
on october   the securities and exchange commission adopted several final rules concerning short selling practices in us securities markets 
among the rules were a an interim final temporary rule that extends  until july   the recently imposed rule t requiring that firms buy or borrow securities to close out any fail to deliver position in an equity security resulting from a long or a short sale by the beginning of regular trading hours on the next settlement day following the date the fail to deliver position arose  b a rule eliminating the options market maker exception to the close out requirement for short sales under regulation sho  and c an antifraud rule prohibiting misrepresentations by a short seller regarding its ability or intention to deliver securities by the settlement date in connection with both long and short sales 
the rules are generally consistent with the series of emergency orders issued by the sec in september and october included in the interim final temporary rule t are certain exemptions and extends the time to deliver securities to cover such short sales by up to two trading days for certain bona fide market makers such as our specialist and market making businesses in connection with their bona fide market making activities 
although we believe these new rules and emergency orders have contributed to a more volatile and active securities market place in september and october  possibly creating more opportunities to trade  we currently are unable to make a determination as to whether and how such new rules will affect our business in the future 
we believe that the new rules exemptions and additional time to cover failed short positions has enabled our market making business to comply with the new requirements of regulation sho while maintaining our market making and liquidity provision obligations  but cannot provide assurance that these provisions will continue to work for our benefit 
new nyse market model in december  the nyse introduced a new market model following the approval by the sec on october   that resulted in significant changes in nyse s market structure 
the new market model was fully implemented in january  and the changes include  among other things  a specialists are now called designated market makers  or dmms  b the alteration of nyse s priority and parity rules  including those that will allow dmms to trade on parity with orders on nyse s display book  and iii the introduction of new order functionality  including the dmm capital commitment schedule ccs and hidden orders 
in order to achieve parity trading for the dmms  the new market model eliminated the order by order advance look specialists received  but the dmm is relieved of their negative obligation to not trade for its own account unless reasonably necessary to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market 
the role of the designated market maker remains essentially unchanged from the role of the specialist  in that the designated market maker is the primary provider of liquidity and information with respect to the companies it represents on the floor of the nyse  but without the first look at order flow and without many of the negative and affirmative obligations to which we were subject prior to the new market model 
the nyse has stated that this change gives the dmm greater freedom to manage the trading risks associated with their reduced responsibilities to the nyse market 
in addition  dmms will continue to be able to generate orders through an algorithm that interacts directly with the nyse s display book 
furthermore  the dmms will be able to commit additional liquidity in advance to fill incoming orders via the ccs  which is a liquidity schedule setting forth various price points where the dmm is willing to interact with incoming orders 
the new market model was fully implemented on january  the new market model is requiring us to redesign our trading algorithms and technology 
to date in the first quarter of  our trading revenues have significantly declined  and we cannot yet be sure if these results have declined due to poor market conditions or the change in market structure 
completed purchases of outstanding indebtedness as of december   our remaining outstanding indebtedness consisted of million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due the notes 
we purchased million of our outstanding notes and of our outstanding senior notes due the notes in open market transactions during we also repurchased million of the notes by exercising a redemption opportunity under the debt covenants of that issue on may  at plus accrued and unpaid interest 
our management and board of directors continue to monitor the opportunities to purchase our remaining outstanding notes at or below the call price

the other fees in this line item are related to a specialist and now dmm liquidity provision payment the lpp program implemented on september   which varies month to month depending on our principal trading activities on the nyse and which replaced an interim specialist allocation pool payment we received in the amount of million per month by the nyse for the period from december through august the new lpp system involves a two tier fee structure based on the firms proportional share of of the consolidated tape revenue earned by the nyse for quoting at the national best bid and offer  and a subjective allocation from the nyse of the lpp pool which consists of of the nyse s listed stock transaction revenue on matched volume 
this monthly payment  in the aggregate  has been approximately million per month in net loss on investments reflects the aggregate losses generated from our investments in restricted and unrestricted nyx shares and other investments not derived specifically from market making activities 
other revenue at our market making segment consists primarily of miscellaneous receipts not derived specifically from market making activities

generally  an increase in the average daily share volume on the nyse  an increase in volatility as measured by the average closing price of the cboe s volatility index  or the vix  an increase in the dollar value and share volume of our principal shares or a decrease in program trading enables us to increase our level of principal participation and thus our ability to realize net gain on principal transactions 
while we monitor these metrics each period  they are not the sole indicators or factors in any given period that determine our level of revenues  profitability or overall performance 
other factors  such as extreme price movements  unanticipated news and events and other uncertainties may influence our financial performance either positively or negatively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the increase in our net gain on principal transactions was attributable to gains in both our cash equities and derivative product market making businesses principal trading revenue for the twelve months ended december  as compared to december  this increase in principal trading revenues was directly related to volatile trading conditions noted during the third and fourth quarters of during this period both the cboe vix index and trading volumes increased simultaneously 
commission and other fees revenue for the year ended december  decreased as the result of the nyse rule change in december implementing the rebate program for certain specialist limit order transactions 
in  we received a specialist allocation pool payment in the amount of million per month from the nyse  versus the average monthly commission of million per month in net loss gain on investments is mainly the result of the unrealized loss on our nyx shares of million  which represents the decline in the fair value of the nyx shares since december  from to per share 
other interest revenues decreased due to lower average interest rate yields earned on our investment of cash 
other revenue is mainly comprised of proprietary trading activities and our receipt from the quarterly dividend declared by nyse euronext  inc interest expense decreased primarily as a result of decreased inventory financing costs relating to a decrease in our positions and lower interest rates relating to inventory financing costs such as margin interest

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million in assets  of which million consisted of cash and short term investments  primarily in overnight time deposits  government obligations maturing within thirty days and cash and securities segregated under federal regulations 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily with cash flows from operations and proceeds from our debt and equity offerings 
due to the nature of the securities business and our role as a market maker and execution agent  the amount of our cash and short term investments  as well as operating cash flow  may vary considerably due to a number of factors  including the dollar value of our positions as principal  whether we are net buyers or sellers of securities  the dollar volume of executions by our customers and clearing house requirements  among others 
certain regulatory requirements constrain the use of a portion of our liquid assets for financing  investing or operating activities 
similarly  the nature of our business lines  the capital necessary to maintain current operations and our current funding needs subject our cash and cash equivalents to different requirements and uses 
as of december   the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations  without taking into account any available roll over provisions  were as follows total years s omitted short term and long term debt operating lease obligations total the above information excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period that it might potentially be paid to tax authorities 
purchases of outstanding senior notes for the year ended december  were as follows s omitted purchase date due may due may balance at december  january  january  february  february  may  october  december  balance at december  as of december   our only remaining long term indebtedness was the million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may in the fourth quarter of we purchased an aggregate of million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due may below par 
in the first quarter of  we purchased and cancelled million of our outstanding senior notes due and million of our senior notes due in open market transactions 
on may  we redeemed of all of the remaining outstanding senior notes due  in the aggregate principal amount of million  at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon  pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the indenture governing the notes 
at december   our net cash capital position was million 
fluctuations in net cash capital are common and are a function of variability in our total assets  balance sheet composition and total capital 
we attempt to maintain cash capital sources in excess of our aggregate longer term funding requirements ie  positive net cash capital 
over the previous months  our net cash capital has averaged above million 
millions cash capital available stockholders equity subordinated debt long term debt year other holding company liabilities total cash capital available cash capital required regulatory capital working capital nyx unrestricted shares illiquid assets long term investments subsidiary intercompany total cash capital required net cash capital in february  our regulatory capital was reduced by approximately million in connection with the nyse s reduction of the nla specialist capital requirement 
this amount was paid as a dividend to our holding company 
cash capital available is mainly comprised of stockholders equity  long term debt  subordinated debt and other liabilities of our parent holding company which  in the aggregate  constitute the currency used to purchase our assets and provide our working capital 
this amount will principally be affected as debt matures or is refinanced and as earnings are retained or paid as dividends 
cash capital required mainly consists of the assets used in our businesses 
regulatory capital is defined as capital required by the sec and applicable exchanges to be maintained by broker dealers 
it is principally comprised of cash  net equities  other investments and net receivables from other broker dealers 
working capital constitutes liquid assets provided to our subsidiaries in excess of the required regulatory capital 
illiquid assets and long term investments are mainly comprised of exchange memberships  intangible assets  such as goodwill  tradename  deposits  deferred taxes and non marketable investments 
net cash capital is considered to be the excess of cash capital available over cash capital required  or free cash  which we can utilize to fund our business needs 
we also monitor alternative funding measures in addition to our available net cash 
the alternative funding measures are significant transactions and actions we could take in a short term time frame to generate cash to meet debt maturities or other business needs 
more precisely  as of december   we have identified the following alternative funding measures to support future debt maturity requirements liquidation of available net invested capital at certain subsidiaries  reduction of excess capital at labranche co 
llc to only required nla ie  declare and pay a dividend to the holding company of excess nla  further reduction of nla requirements by the nyse and sec  and our nyx shares  as previously discussed  can be either sold or held as qualifying regulatory capital

following our repurchases of senior and subordinated debt  we maintain our ability to repurchase in whole or in part the remaining senior notes at any time up to the maturity date  in may  without impacting the current operations at any of its trading subsidiaries 
our notes are currently trading below par in the open market 
strong relationships with a diverse base of creditors and debt investors are critical to our liquidity 
we also maintain available sources of short term funding that exceed actual utilization  thus allowing us to accommodate changes in investor appetite and credit capacity for our debt obligations 
with respect to the management of refinancing risk  the maturity profile of our long term debt portfolio is monitored on an ongoing basis 
in  we strategically refinanced our outstanding indebtedness and created two new series of senior notes maturing in and which represented a significant portion of our outstanding debt 
on may   we redeemed all of our remaining outstanding senior notes due  in the aggregate principal amount of million  at a price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon  pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the indenture governing the notes 
following the redemption  million of our senior notes due remains outstanding at december  under the indenture 
our annual interest expense related to those remaining outstanding senior notes going forward is expected to be approximately million  excluding debt issuance cost amortization expense 
the debt has available maturities and calls over the four year period through to allow us maximum flexibility in satisfying the debt servicing payments and or sufficient time to refinance the long term debt  if necessary 
the debt is redeemable at redemption prices of on or after may  and on or after may  our outstanding senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture which includes certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to make certain investments  engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  create liens on our assets and sell assets or engage in mergers and consolidations  except in accordance with certain specified conditions 
in addition  our ability to make so called restricted payments  such as incurring additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  paying dividends  redeeming stock or repurchasing subordinated indebtedness prior to maturity  is limited if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is at or below a threshold of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio reflects a comparison between our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  or ebitda  and the sum of our consolidated interest expense and a tax effected multiple of any dividend payments with respect to our preferred stock  and this ratio is calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fixed quarter on a trailing four quarter basis 
as of december   our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  was this ratio was impacted by the repurchase of the senior notes during  because the indenture allows us to deem any indebtedness purchased in the trailing four quarter period as not outstanding throughout the period  thus giving pro forma effect to the consolidated interest expense versus fixed debt 
while our fixed charge ratio is above  the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes enable us to make cumulative restricted payments in an amount that is not greater than i the sum of a of our cumulative consolidated net income  as defined in the indenture  since july  or  if such calculation is a loss  minus of such loss and b of the net cash proceeds received from any issuance or sale of our capital stock since july   plus ii million 
if our cumulative restricted payments since may  at any time exceeds this restricted payment calculation  we will not be able to make any additional restricted payments 
however  this calculation is recomputed each quarterly calendar period as allowed under the covenants in the indenture 
as of december   of our cumulative consolidated net income since july  was million  and we had received approximately million upon the exercise of options since july  when these amounts are added to the million allowance  as of december   we were entitled to make restricted payments of million  excluding the stock repurchases we made during the year of million 
we cannot be sure if  when or to what extent this covenant will prevent or limit us from making restricted payments in the future 
in april of  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase plan 
while the restricted payment allowance would allow us to repurchase the full amount of shares under the plan  we have repurchased million of our shares under this plan during in the amount of million  or an average price of per share  as described more fully above in item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters  and issuer purchases of equity securities 
we have funded  and will continue to fund  our share repurchases through a combination of cash from operations and excess cash at our holding company  dependent upon market conditions 
as discussed above  the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes permits us to redeem some or all of the senior notes due on or after may  at varying redemption prices  depending on the date of redemption 
in addition  under the terms of the indenture  if we sell substantially all our assets or experience specific kinds of changes in control  we will be required to offer to repurchase outstanding senior notes  on a pro rata basis  at a price in cash equal to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
any time we repurchase our outstanding senior notes  our fixed term interest payments are correspondingly reduced 
during we repurchased an aggregate of million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due and an aggregate of million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due these purchases of our outstanding senior notes resulted in annual interest savings of approximately million 
to the extent we repurchase any remaining outstanding senior notes due in connection with future corporate strategic initiatives  our fixed term interest payments would be correspondingly reduced 
as of december   the subordinated indebtedness of labranche co 
llc was repurchased and terminated in its entirety 
this subordinated debt was comprised of senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  which matured on various dates between june and april and bore interest at annual rates ranging from to 
the senior subordinated notes were originally issued in the aggregate principal amount of million  and  in accordance with their terms  million in principal amount must be repaid on june in each of the years through labranche co 
llc repaid million in accordance with these terms in each of june through in the second quarter of  we repaid the remaining million in junior subordinated notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
our other liabilities of million reflected on the accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition are principally comprised of uncertain tax positions pursuant to fin such contingencies are considered long term  as there is no present obligation to pay such liabilities in the foreseeable future 
during the third quarter of we completed a multi year tax audit with the local taxing authorities resulting in a million payment for that period for both taxes and interest 
regulated subsidiaries as a market maker  we are required to maintain certain levels of capital and liquid assets as promulgated by various regulatory agencies which regulate our business 
as part of our overall risk management procedures for further discussion  refer to part i  item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we attempt to balance our responsibility as a market maker and broker dealer with our overall capital resources 
these requirements restrict our ability to make use of cash and other liquid assets for corporate actions  such as repaying our debt  repurchasing stock or making acquisitions 
as a broker dealer  labranche co 
llc is subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers and requiring the maintenance of minimum levels of net capital  as defined in sec rule c labranche co 
llc is required to maintain minimum net capital  as defined  equivalent to the greater of  or 
of aggregate indebtedness  as defined 
nyse rule c also prohibits a broker dealer from repaying subordinated borrowings  paying cash dividends  making loans to any parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which would result in a reduction of its total net capital to less than of its required minimum capital 
moreover  broker dealers are required to notify the sec prior to repaying subordinated borrowings  paying dividends and making loans to any parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which  if executed  would result in a reduction of or more of their excess net capital net capital less minimum requirement 
the sec has the ability to prohibit or restrict such transactions if the result is deemed detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker dealer 
as of december   labranche co 
llc s net capital  as defined  was million  which exceeded the minimum requirements by million 
the nyse generally requires its market maker firms to maintain a minimum dollar regulatory capital amount in order to establish that they can meet  with their own nla  their position requirement 
as of december   labranche co 
llc s nyse minimum required dollar amount of nla  as defined  was million  and its actual nla  as defined  was million 
as of december   labranche co 
llc s minimum required dollar amount of nla  as defined  was million and its actual nla  as defined  was million 
labranche co 
llc thus satisfied its nla requirement as of each of those dates 
the minimum required dollar amount of nla fluctuates daily and is computed by adding two components 
the first component is equal to million for each one tenth of one percent  prior to february the first component was equal to million for each one tenth of one percent  of the aggregate nyse transaction dollar volume in a cash equities specialist organization s allocated securities  as adjusted at the beginning of each month based on the prior month transaction dollar volume 
the second component is calculated either by multiplying the average haircuts on a specialist organization s proprietary positions over the most recent twenty days by three  or by using an nyse approved value at risk var model 
based on this two part calculation  labranche co 
llc s nla requirement could increase or decrease in future periods based on its own trading activity and all other specialists respective percentages of overall nyse transaction dollar volume 
in february  the sec approved  with immediate effect  an approximate reduction in the required nla that needed to be maintained by cash equity specialists to transact business on the nyse 
this resulted in a reduction of our required nla by approximately million  of which million was moved at such time to our holding company for other current or future corporate purposes 
in may  labranche co 
llc distributed million of excess nla to the holding company 
pursuant to these nla rules  labranche co llc is entitled to use unrestricted shares of nyx stock as nla  instead of cash for regulatory capital  subject to risk based haircuts 
as a result  labranche co 
llc s nla as of december  includes approximately million in nyx shares after the risk based haircuts 
since our million nla reduction was implemented in february  the majority of the amended nla requirement can be met by the nyx shares held by labranche co 
llc 
the amended nla requirements enabled labranche co 
llc to declare a dividend distribution of million to the holding company  which was paid in february and march as a registered broker dealer and member firm of the nyse  lfs is also subject to sec rule c  as adopted and administered by the sec and the nyse

in september  moody s investor services changed its credit rating of our outstanding senior notes from b to b  which is the company s rating at december   but continued a stable outlook due to our high quality balance sheet and improved liquidity 
in august  we determined that only one rating agency was necessary to provide a rating for the outstanding senior notes 
as such  we terminated our relationship for credit rating services from standard poor s investor services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to regulatory requirements that prescribe communication barriers between our broker dealer subsidiaries  we employ different compliance risk management procedures at each such subsidiary 
these risk processes are set forth below our cash equities dmm risk management process because our cash equities activities on the nyse expose our capital to significant risks  managing these risks is a constant priority for us 
our central role in the hybrid market helps us to manage risks by incorporating up to date market information in the management of our inventory  subject to our specialist obligations 
we have developed a risk management process at our labranche co 
llc subsidiary that is designed to balance our ability to profit from our dmm activities with our exposure to potential losses and compliance risk 
this risk management process includes participation by our corporate compliance committee  executive operating committee  floor management committee  post managers  floor captains  specialists and chief risk officer 
these parties roles are as follows corporate compliance committee 
labranche co 
llc s corporate compliance committee consists of representatives from executive and senior management  compliance personnel  including our on floor compliance officer  our general counsel  our chief regulatory officer and several additional senior floor dmms  known as post managers 
the role of the corporate compliance committee is to monitor and report to senior management on the statutory and regulatory compliance efforts of our dmm business 
the corporate compliance committee also advises the compliance department in establishing  reviewing and revising our policies and procedures governing labranche co 
llc s regulatory compliance structure 
executive operating committee 
our executive operating committee is composed of two executive officers 
this committee is responsible for approving all risk management procedures and trading guidelines for our dmm stocks  after receiving recommendations from our floor management committee 
in addition  our executive operating committee reviews all unusual situations reported to it by our floor management committee 
floor management committee 
our nyse floor management committee is currently composed of one senior floor manager  six post managers  one wheel manager and one floor administrative personnel manager 
this committee is responsible for formulating and overseeing our overall risk management procedures and trading guidelines for each of our dmm stocks 
in determining these procedures and guidelines  the floor management committee considers the recommendations of the floor captains 
the post managers generally meet with their respective floor captains on a weekly basis to review and  if necessary  revise the risk management procedures and trading guidelines for particular dmm stocks 
the wheel managers ensure that the floor is adequately staffed at all times 
in addition  post managers  wheel managers and floor captains are always available on the trading floor to review and assist with any unusual trading situations reported by a floor captain  and the swat team manager is available to assess and provide assistance on break out  or intense trading situations 
our floor management committee reports to our executive operating committee about each of these trading situations as they occur 
our floor management committee also trains other dmm and trading assistants on a regular basis on new rules and or interpretations from the nyse with respect to our dmm obligations and guidelines  with the assistance of our compliance department 
floor captains 
we currently employ four floor captains who monitor the activities of our cash equities dmms throughout the trading day from various positions at our trading posts 
the floor captains observe trades and constantly review trading activities on a real time basis 
in addition  the floor captains are readily available to assist our specialists in determining when to deviate from procedures and guidelines in reacting to any unusual situations or market conditions 
the floor captains report these unusual situations and any deviations from these procedures and guidelines to their respective post managers 
floor captains meet with each dmm at least once a week to evaluate each dmm s adherence to our risk management procedures and trading guidelines  as well as to review compliance reports generated by the compliance department in monitoring and reviewing dmm trading activities 
floor captains also meet to review risk procedures and guidelines and  if appropriate  make recommendations to the floor management committee 
dmms 
our dmms conduct electronic and  at times  manual auctions of our dmm stocks based upon the conditions of the marketplace 
in doing so  dmms observe our risk management procedures and trading guidelines in tandem with their responsibility to create and maintain a fair and orderly market 
dmms promptly notify a floor captain of any unusual situations or market conditions requiring a deviation from our procedures and guidelines on floor compliance officer 
we also have an on floor compliance officer that monitors the dmms compliance with nyse rules throughout the day on an ad hoc basis 
the on floor compliance officer reports his findings and on general on floor compliance initiatives on a daily basis to our equity dmm unit s chief compliance officer and chief executive officer and provides summary updates of these efforts to the corporate compliance committee on a monthly basis 
in addition  we have at least one trading assistant at each post on the nyse floor who is compliance registered and able to review trading activities to monitor compliance with rules 
many of our compliance and risk management activities flow from the efforts of our on floor compliance initiative 
electronic exception reports 
we have implemented a system of electronic rule exception reports at our labranche co 
llc subsidiary to monitor our compliance with nyse and sec rules 
these reports are generated on a daily basis  from one to three days after each trading day  and are the result of significant development efforts from our technology group  with advice of our compliance and legal staff 
our compliance staff reviews these exception reports daily  and in the event an exception is detected  the exception is researched in detail by our on floor compliance officer or another compliance officer to determine if a compliance issue is found 
if a compliance issue is detected  we make an effort to correct the problem and conduct training of our specialists and or distribute compliance bulletins to ensure our specialists understand the rule and processes going forward 
certain detected issues are discussed at monthly compliance committee meetings 
we believe that enhancements we have made to our compliance procedures and guidelines  and on a continuous basis as circumstances warrant  have continued to improve our risk management process 
circuit breaker rules 
the nyse has instituted certain circuit breaker rules intended to halt trading in all nyse listed stocks in the event of a severe market decline 
the circuit breaker rules impose temporary halts in trading when the dow jones industrial average drops a certain number of points 
current circuit breaker levels are set quarterly at  and percent of the dow jones industrial average closing values of the previous month  rounded to the nearest points 
these rules provide investors extra time to respond to severe market declines and provide us an additional opportunity to assure compliance with our risk management procedures 
equity market financial risk we have developed a risk management process  which is intended to balance our ability to profit from our equity dmm activities with our exposure to potential losses 
we have invested substantial capital  along with the nyse  in real time  on line systems which give our management  including our chief risk officer  access to specific trading information during the trading day  including our aggregate long and short positions and our capital and profit and loss information on an aggregate or per issue basis 
subject to the dmm s obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market and to applicable regulatory requirements  we constantly seek to manage our trading positions relative to existing market conditions 
our equity dmm trading activities are subject to a number of risks  including risks of price fluctuations  rapid changes in the liquidity of markets and foreign exchange risk related to american depositary receipts adrs 
in any period  we may incur trading losses or gains in our dmm stocks for a variety of reasons  including price fluctuations of our dmm stocks and fulfillment of our dmm obligations 
quantification of such losses or gains would not be meaningful as standard market studies do not capture our dmm obligations 
from time to time  we may have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because our inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis  any significant price movement in these securities could result in an immediate reduction of our revenues and operating profits 
our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making risk management process as specialists in options  etfs and futures in our lsh group of entities  we have a responsibility to maintain a fair and orderly market  and trade securities as principal out of both obligation and inclination 
our options  etfs  futures  us government obligations and foreign currency specialist trading exposes us to certain risks  such as price and interest rate fluctuations  volatility risk  credit risk  foreign currency movements and changes in the liquidity of markets 
additionally  as a market maker in options  etfs and futures through our lsh group of entities  we also trade as principal 
in our market making function  we bring immediacy and liquidity to the markets when we participate 
our market making activities expose us to certain risks  including  but not limited to  price fluctuations and volatility 
in connection with our market making activities  we are engaged in various securities trading and lending activities and assume positions in stocks  rights  options  etfs  us government securities  corporate securities  futures and foreign currencies for which we are exposed to credit risk associated with the nonperformance of counterparties in fulfilling their contractual obligations pursuant to these securities transactions 
we are also exposed to market risk associated with the sale of securities not yet purchased  which can be directly impacted by volatile trading on the nyse  the amex and other exchanges 
additionally  in the event of nonperformance and unfavorable market price movements  we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at a loss 
our traders purchase and sell futures  options  the stocks underlying certain etf and options positions  us government securities and foreign currencies in an attempt to hedge market and foreign currency risk 
certain members of management  including our chief risk officer  who oversee our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making activities are responsible for monitoring these risks 
these managers utilize a third party software application  as well as information received directly from the traders  to monitor specialist and market making positions on a real time basis 
by monitoring actual and theoretical profit and loss  volatility and other standard risk measures  these individuals seek to insure that our traders operate within the parameters set by management 
furthermore  our aggregate risk in connection with our options  futures and etfs trading is under constant evaluation by certain members of management and our traders  and all significant trading strategies and positions are closely monitored 
when an unusual or large position is observed by the chief risk officer  he communicates the issue to senior management  who communicate with the trader to understand the strategy and risk management behind the trade and  if necessary  determine avenues to mitigate our risk exposure 
our options  futures and etfs trading is executed on national and foreign exchanges 
these trades clear through the options clearing corporation  the national securities clearing corporation or the applicable exchange clearing organization  which reduces potential credit risk 
the following chart illustrates how specified movements in the underlying securities prices of the options  futures and etfs in our specialist and market making portfolios would have impacted profits and losses s omitted profit or loss if the underlying securities move portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no standard methodology for estimating this risk  and different methodologies would produce materially different estimates 
the zero percent change column represents the profit or loss our options  futures and etfs specialist operations would experience on a daily basis if the relevant market remained unchanged 
foreign currency risk interest rate risk in connection with the trading of us registered shares of foreign issuers in connection with our cash equities specialist operations  we are exposed to varying degrees of foreign currency risk 
the pricing of these securities is based on the value of the ordinary securities as denominated in their local currencies 
thus  a change in a foreign currency exchange rate relative to the us dollar will result in a change in the value of us registered shares in which we are the specialist 
our etf specialists and market makers trade international etfs that are denominated and settled in us dollars  but the pricing of these etfs is also affected by changes in the relevant foreign currency rates 
we  therefore  hold various foreign currencies in order to lessen the risks posed by changing foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  lsp trades derivatives denominated in foreign currencies  which creates exposure to foreign currency risk 
the following chart illustrates how the specified movements in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar to which our specialist and market making activities are exposed would have impacted our profits and losses s omitted profit or loss if the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar move portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the information in the above table is based on certain assumptions and it does not fully represent the profit and loss exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  security prices  volatility  interest rates and other related factors 
as specialists and market makers in options  etfs and futures  we generally maintain large specialist and market maker positions 
historically  we have been operating in a low and moderate interest rate market 
as such  we may be sensitive to interest rate increases or decreases and or widening credit spreads may create a less favorable operating environment for this line of business 
concentration risk we are subject to concentration risk by holding large positions or committing to hold large positions in certain types of securities 
as of december   our largest unhedged proprietary position is our nyx shares 
this concentration does not arise in the normal course of business 
institutional brokerage risk our institutional brokerage segment  through the normal course of business  enters into various securities transactions acting in an agency or principal basis 
the execution of these transactions can result in unrecorded market risk and concentration of credit risk 
our institutional brokerage activities involve execution and financing of various customer securities transactions on a cash or margin basis 
these activities may expose us to risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations and we have to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  we may be exposed to significant market risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur in their accounts 
institutional brokerage risk management process our institutional brokerage activities require that we execute transactions in accordance with customer instructions and accurately record and process the resulting transactions 
any failure  delay or error in executing  recording and processing transactions  whether due to human error or failure of our information or communication systems  could cause substantial losses for brokers  customers and or us and could subject us to claims for losses 
we also execute orders as principal in our role as market maker and  at times  to facilitate customer transactions 
to monitor the risk in these positions  we use an internally developed desk top system that is constantly running on the desktop screens of our institutional brokerage firm s senior management  chief compliance officer and trading systems manager 
upon escalation to other members of senior management  research and diligence is performed as to the positions and risk and determinations are made as to how to limit the exposure 
once a position is established  our traders may attempt to manage the risk associated with the position by use of etf strategies  futures on the s p  or with an industry sector comparable security or other method approved by senior management 
despite these risk management efforts  these facilitation positions may result in trading losses that could adversely affect our commission revenues 
since june  our customer margin transactions have been cleared through a major wall street firm 
these customer margin transactions are financed by the clearing firm based on our instructions 
we are liable to the clearing firm for any losses incurred by the clearing firm in connection with our customers margin transactions 
our past clearing activities through june  included settling each transaction with both the contra broker and the customer 
in connection with our institutional and direct access floor brokerage activities  a transaction was settled either when the customer paid for securities purchased and took delivery  or delivered securities sold for payment 
settling transactions for retail customers and professional investors involved financing the transaction until the customer made payment or  for margin accounts  advancing credit to the customer within regulatory and internal guidelines 
through september  clearing direct access brokers transactions included guaranteeing their transactions to the contra broker on the exchange floor 
these clearing activities may have exposed us to off balance sheet risk in the event customers or brokers were unable to fulfill their contractual obligations and it was necessary to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  we may have been exposed to off balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements were not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may have incurred in their accounts 
the amount of risk related to our execution and clearance activities was linked to the size of the transaction  market volatility and the creditworthiness of customers and brokers 
our largest transactions involved those for institutional and direct access floor brokerage customers 
we systematically monitor our open transaction risk in connection with our institutional brokerage activities  starting when the transaction occurs and continuing until the designated settlement date 
transactions that remain unsettled after settlement date are scrutinized and necessary action to reduce risk is taken 
even under our new clearing arrangement with a major wall street firm  credit risk that could result from contra brokers defaulting is minimized since much of the settlement risk for transactions with brokers is essentially transferred to the national stock clearing corporation 
the credit risk associated with institutional and direct access clearing customers is minimized since these customers have been qualified by the depository trust company dtc or the dtc participants or have met the prime broker qualification standards at other brokerage firms 
before conducting business with a prospective customer  senior management that oversees our institutional brokerage operations  in conjunction with the related compliance department  reviews the prospective customer s experience in the securities industry  financial condition and personal background  including a background check with a risk reporting agency  although some of this responsibility now is undertaken by our outsourced clearing firm 
the following chart illustrates how specified movements in the underlying securities prices in our institutional brokerage portfolios would have impacted profits and losses s omitted profit or loss if the underlying securities move portfolio as of march  june  september  december  operational and technology risk operational risk relates to the risk of loss from external events  and from failures in internal processes or information systems

these terminals allow us to monitor our nyse specialist trading profits and losses  as well as our positions 
our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making operations utilize a third party software application to monitor our positions and profits and losses on a real time basis

our trading technologies are developed and maintained by our information technology personnel and their development process is subject to policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of technology design flaws and programming errors
