item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial conditions and results of operations 
the information in this section has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto  which appear in item of this form k 
you should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding first savings bank as provided in this form k 
unless otherwise indicated  the financial information presented in this section reflects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of first financial northwest and its subsidiaries 
overview first savings bank is a community based savings bank primarily serving king and to a lesser extent  pierce  kitsap and snohomish counties  washington through our full service banking office 
we are in the business of attracting deposits from the public through our office and utilizing those deposits to originate loans 
historically  we have been a traditional fixed rate portfolio lender originating residential home loans 
our business strategy centers on the continued transition to commercial banking activities in order to expand our net interest margin 
since december  we have increased the amount of our construction land development loans from to of our total loan portfolio at december  while reducing our one to four family residential loans from to over the same period 
at december  our construction land development loans totaled million or of our loan portfolio  substantially all which are short term adjustable rate loans 
in contrast  our residential mortgage loans  commercial real estate and multifamily loans are generally long term fixed rate loans 
we have not actively participated in traditional one to four family adjustable rate mortgages  which totaled million at december  included in this portfolio are construction permanent loans which adjust based on prime during the construction phase but convert to a fixed rate loan upon completion  along with a limited number of seasoned residential loans 
we consider this an insignificant portion of our loan portfolio and do not promote this type of loan product  nor do we generally offer ateaser rates 
our loss history for this type of lending has been immaterial 
prior to the latter half of  real estate and home values increased substantially  as a result of the generally strong national economy  speculative investing  and aggressive lending practices that provided loans to marginal borrowers generally termed as asubprime loans 
the strong economy also resulted in strong increases in residential and commercial real estate values and commercial and residential construction 
the national residential lending market has since experienced worsening conditions in the last year as loan delinquencies and foreclosure rates have risen to unprecedented volumes 
the national delinquency rate for one to four family residential loans days or more delinquent was and the percentage of loans on which foreclosure actions were started based on annualized third quarter of data was  according to the national delinquency survey published by the mortgage bankers association 
in addition  according to the survey the national percentage of subprime mortgage loans in foreclosure was 
nationally  foreclosures and delinquencies are also being driven by investor speculation in the states of arizona  california  florida and nevada  while job losses and depressed economic conditions in indiana  michigan and ohio have resulted in the highest level of seriously delinquent loans 
louisiana and mississippi also have high residential loan delinquencies as a result of hurricane katrina related economic factors 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income 
since first savings bank is liability sensitive meaning its liabilities reprice at a faster rate than its interest earning assets  the lower interest rate environment that we are currently experiencing has contributed to an improvement in our net interest rate spread and net interest margin 
although historically our loan losses have been low  during our provision for loan losses totaled million 
of this amount  million related to impaired loans in our residential construction land development and one to four family loan portfolios related to specific borrowing relationships 
the balance of the provision was attributable to the change in the mix of our loan portfolio  the uncertain economy  and the increase in delinquencies among other factors 
we will continue to monitor our loan portfolio and make adjustments to our allowance for loan losses as we deem necessary 
our operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment  data processing  marketing  postage and supplies  professional services and deposit insurance premiums 
compensation and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes and expenses for retirement and other employee benefits 
occupancy and equipment expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of building and equipment  consist primarily of real estate taxes  depreciation charges  maintenance and costs of utilities 
our employee stock ownership plan acquired  shares of first financial northwest common stock with a million loan from first financial northwest that will be be repaid over years  resulting in an annual pre tax increase in compensation expense of approximately million assuming that the common stock maintains a value of per share 
our operating expense has increased as a result of this increase in compensation expenses associated with the allocation of employee stock ownership plan shares to employees 
the actual expense that will be recorded for the employee stock ownership plan will be determined by the market value of the shares of common stock as they are released to employees over the term of the loan 
accordingly  increases in the stock price above per share will increase the total employee stock ownership plan expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded additional pre tax operating expense of million as a result of increased compensation costs with respect to the implementation of our employee stock ownership plan 
in june  after receiving shareholder approval  we implemented our stock based incentive plans  which resulted in an increase in operating expenses 
in july  stock options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock were issued to directors and employees of the company at a weighted average price of per share 
the fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes model using an annual dividend yield of  expected volatility of  a risk free interest rate of and an expected term of years 
as a result  the corresponding annual pre tax expenses associated with the stock option plan was  in addition  under our stock based incentive plan we awarded approximately  shares of restricted stock to eligible participants at a weighted average price of per share  which vest over a five year period beginning at the grant date  and which will be expensed as the awards vest over the five year period 
for further information  see the aemployee benefit plans note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report on form k 
our noninterest expenses decreased million during the year ended december  as compared to during  a one time contribution was made to the first financial northwest foundation totaling million 
absent this one time contribution  noninterest expenses for increased million as compared to during  management focused on the development of the first financial northwest s infrastructure as it related to staffing and systems 
this resulted in the additions of several key personnel during the year which included a new chief financial officer  a business banking manager  a financial analyst  and additional support staff 
management believes these additions will position us for future growth 
effective january  we also hired a senior vice president  strategic development to develop and execute a strategic plan for first savings bank 
business strategy we are a community oriented savings bank whose focus for the past several years has been primarily to gather deposits to fund a diversified mix of residential mortgage loans  commercial and multifamily real estate loans and construction land development loans 
our business strategy is to operate and grow first savings bank as a well capitalized and profitable community bank  offering primarily one to four family mortgage loans  commercial and multifamily real estate loans and construction land development loans along with a diversified array of deposits and other products and services to individuals and businesses in our market areas 
we intend to accomplish this strategy by leveraging our established name and franchise  capital strength and mortgage production capability by capitalizing on our intimate knowledge of our local communities to serve the convenience and needs of customers  delivering a consistent and high quality level of professional service  offering competitive deposit rates and developing customer relationships to expand our core deposits  diversify the deposit mix by growing lower cost deposits  attracting new customers and expanding the company s footprint in the geographical area it serves  manage our loan portfolio to minimize concentrations and diversify the types of loans within the portfolio  managing credit risk to minimize the risk of loss to the bank  and interest rate risk to optimize our net interest margin  and improving our overall efficiency and profitability 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have  or could have  a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets 
our critical accounting policies are those related to our allowance for loan losses and deferred taxes 
allowance for loan losses management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for analyzing the allowance for loan losses consists of two components formula and specific allowances 
the formula allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans 
management considers factors such as charge off history  the prevailing economy  borrower s ability to repay  the regulatory environment  competition  geographic and loan type concentrations  policy and underwriting standards  nature and volume of the loan portfolio  management s experience level  our loan review system  the value of underlying collateral  the level of problem loans  business conditions and credit concentrations in assessing the allowance for loan losses 
the specific allowance component is created when management believes that the collectibility of a specific loan  such as a real estate  multifamily or commercial real estate loan  has been impaired and a loss is probable 
the specific reserves are computed using current appraisals  listed sales prices and other available information less costs to complete  if any  and sell the property 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions 
our board of directors approves the provision for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is charged against current period earnings and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period requiring management to make assumptions about probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
for additional information see the section titled awe may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations  within the section titled arisks related to our business 
goodwill goodwill represents the costs in excess of net assets acquired arising from the purchases of executive house  inc in december goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to expense during the periods in which the recorded value is more than its fair value 
we evaluate any potential impairment of goodwill on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired at the first financial northwest level 
if first financial northwest s market capitalization total common shares outstanding multiplied by the current stock price exceeds the common book value  absent other indicators of impairments  goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary 
despite negative values in the above tests goodwill might not be considered impaired due to current market volatility and control purchase premiums in the banking industry 
however  an impairment may be recorded in the future if market capitalization continues to decrease 
any potential non cash goodwill impairment expense would not affect first financial northwest s regulatory capital ratios since goodwill is not included in the calculation 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources  the most significant being a expenses  such as our charitable contribution to the first financial northwest foundation  that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years  b expenses recognized in the books but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs  and c writedowns in the value of assets for book purposes that are not deductible for tax until the asset is sold or deemed worthless 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount which can be recognized in line with the relevant accounting standards 
the level of deferred tax asset recognition is influenced by management s assessment of our historic and future profitability profile 
at each balance sheet date  existing assessments are reviewed and  if necessary  revised to reflect changed circumstances 
in a situation where income is less than projected or recent losses have been incurred  the relevant accounting standards require convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future tax capacity 
see federal taxes on income footnote included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other than temporary impairments in the market value of investments declines in the fair value of any available for sale or held to maturity investment below their cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment to that of fair value 
a charge to earnings and an establishment of a new cost basis for the investment is made 
unrealized investment losses are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether such declines should be considered other than temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition in income 
although these evaluations involve significant judgment  an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the investment security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates  there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  and first financial northwest has the intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time to recover the carrying value 
an unrealized loss in the value of an equity security is generally considered temporary when the fair value of the security is below the carrying value primarily due to current market conditions and not deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer 
other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of either a debt or an equity security is other than temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies  the extent and duration of an unrealized loss position  actions of commercial banks or other lenders relative to the continued extension of credit facilities to the issuer of the security  the financial condition  capital strength and near term prospects of the issuer and recommendations of investment advisors or market analysts 
therefore continued deterioration of market conditions could result in additional impairment losses recognized within the investment portfolio 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  general 
our total assets increased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the asset growth resulted mainly from an increase in net loans receivable of million 
in january  we elected to transfer our entire investments held to maturity portfolio to our investments available for sale portfolio

in addition  we also had million in commercial real estate loans that were nonperforming  comprised of two office buildings and a warehouse which due to vacancies are experiencing cash flow issues 
the foregone interest during the year ended december  relating to all nonperforming loans  totaled million 
we intend to work with our builders to reach acceptable payment plans while protecting our interests in the existing collateral 
in the event an acceptable arrangement cannot be reached  we may have to acquire these properties through foreclosure or other means and subsequently sell  develop  or liquidate them 
management performs an impairment analysis on a loan when it determines it is probable that all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled 
the analysis usually occurs when a loan has been negatively classified or placed on nonaccrual status 
if the current value  collateral value less costs to sell  of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  impairment is recognized by establishing a specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the loan or by adjusting an existing allocation 
our analysis of the million in nonperforming construction land development loans resulted in a specific allocation of the allowance 
based on our analysis of these loans  which included the review of either existing or updated appraisals as well as adjustments to those appraisals for deteriorating market conditions  we established an million specific allowance for these loans 
we did not have any real estate owned at december  or deposits 
during the year ended december   deposits increased million to million at december  the increase in deposits was the result of the current economic environment combined with our practice of competitively pricing our deposit products 
increases in certificate of deposit accounts of million  savings accounts of million and non interest bearing accounts of  were partially offset by decreases in money market accounts of million  and now accounts of million 
the majority of the decrease in money market accounts was the result of transfers to certificate of deposit accounts within first savings bank northwest 
first savings bank does not have any brokered deposits 
advances 
we use advances from the federal home loan bank of seattle as an alternative funding source to deposits to manage funding costs and reduce interest rate risk and to leverage our balance sheet

total advances at december  were million  an increase of million  or  from december  the increase in advances was used to fund loan production 
stockholders equity 
total stockholders equity decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily a result of the repurchase of stock to fund the restricted stock portion of the equity incentive plan of million and million related to the repurchase and retirement of  shares of common stock 
the payment of cash dividends for the year ended december  totaled million which was offset by net income of million  the million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net and the decrease in unearned esop shares of million

net interest income 
our net interest income increased million for the year ended december  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the million increase in our average loans receivable partially offset by a basis point decrease in our average yield on our loan portfolio

we intend to continue to utilize excess liquidity to fund loan growth and purchase investments 
in addition  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease was a result of a general decline in interest rates for the year

the majority of the decrease in money market accounts was transfers to certificate of deposit accounts within first savings bank because our certificate of deposit products were priced higher than our money market products 
the remaining growth in our certificates of deposit was the result of higher interest rates offered relative to other investment products in the current interest rate environment 
provision for loan losses 
management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for analyzing the allowance for loan losses consists of two components formula and specific allowances 
the formula allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans 
management considers factors such as charge off history  the prevailing economy  borrower s ability to repay  the regulatory environment  competition  geographic and loan type concentrations  policy and underwriting standards  nature and volume of the loan portfolio  managements experience level  our loan review system and the value of underlying collateral in assessing the allowance for loan losses

the specific reserves are computed using current appraisals  listed sales prices and other available information less costs to complete  if any  and sell the property 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans outstanding  net of undisbursed funds at december  as compared to million or of total loans outstanding  net of undisbursed funds at december  a provision for loan losses of million was recorded for the year ended december  the comparable provision for loan losses for the year ended december  totaled million 
as of december  nonperforming loans  net of undisbursed funds  totaled million as compared to million at december  of our nonperforming assets  million related to the construction land development loan portfolio  primarily located in king and pierce counties and million relate to the commercial real estate loan portfolio 
the construction land development loans are to homebuilders whose sales have been affected by the current credit tightening 
the builder that was identified in the fourth quarter of who was experiencing financial difficulties continues to make progress in advancing on his projects as well as making some housing sales 
the outstanding loan balance net of undisbursed funds for this relationship totaled million at december  the bank believes by working with these builders it can minimize the loss exposure 
although we believe that we used the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments to the allowance for loan losses and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstance differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the allowance 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
future additions to the allowance may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions  the level of problem loans  business conditions  credit concentrations  increased loan balances  or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio 
in addition  the determination of the amount of first savings bank s allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination

the equity compensation plans include first financial northwest s employee stock ownership plan and the equity incentive plan

the average balance of certificates of deposit increased million compared to the same period last year  the average cost of funds for these certificates increased basis points reflecting the higher interest rate environment during the period and related interest expense increased million 
the average balance of advances from the federal home loan bank increased million for the year ended december  from the same period in  the average cost of advances increased basis points and related interest expense increased million 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded a million provision for loan losses for the year ended december   an increase of million from the year ended december  of this increase  million related to million of impaired loans to one builder for projects secured by real estate in king  pierce and thurston counties  washington 
these loans are to a builder of entry level homes whose sales have been impacted by the current credit tightening as first time home purchasers generally have lower credit scores and a minimal amount of equity to finance the purchase 
the remaining increase is attributable to growth in the portfolio and the peer group analysis incorporated as part of the methodology we utilized to compute the balance required for our allowance for loan loss account as a result of our lack of any historical loss experience 
we used a consistent methodology in assessing the allowance for both and however  for our assumptions were modified to place greater emphasis on our increasing construction land development loan portfolio and the incremental risks associated with the increased lending activities 
we also reviewed the national trend of declining home sales with potential housing market value depreciation and our expanded position in construction land development and commercial real estate lending 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans net of undisbursed funds at december  as compared to million  or of total loans outstanding net of undisbursed funds at december  the following table sets forth detailed activity and information related to our allowance for loan losses at the dates and for the periods indicated

mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over  the estimated period the net servicing income will be collected 
the carrying value of mortgage servicing rights is evaluated quarterly in relation to estimated future cash flows to be received with amortization expense adjusted to reflect any change in valuation 
other noninterest income increased  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the difference was primarily attributable to proceeds of  on a one time payment due from an insurance policy first savings bank owned on one of its former officers who passed away in december  wire transfer fees generated approximately  mainly from customers involved with our mutual to stock conversion and an increase in miscellaneous fees and other income of  noninterest expense

our board of directors has established an asset liability management policy to guide management in maximizing net interest rate spread by managing the differences in terms between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities while maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity  capital adequacy  interest rate sensitivity  credit risk and profitability 
the policy includes the use of an asset liability management committee whose members include certain members of senior management 
the committee s purpose is to communicate  coordinate and manage our asset liability positions consistent with our business plan and board approved policies  as well as to price savings and lending products  and to develop new products 
the asset liability management committee meets monthly to review various areas including economic conditions  interest rate outlook  asset liability mix  interest rate risk sensitivity  current market opportunities to promote specific products  historical financial results  projected financial results  and capital position 
the committee also reviews current and projected liquidity needs  although not necessarily on a monthly basis 
as part of its procedures  the asset liability management committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential change in market value of portfolio equity that is authorized by the board of directors 
our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
in recent years  we primarily have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk we have increased our originations of shorter term loans and particularly  construction land development loans and consumer loans  we have structured our borrowings with relatively short terms to maturity to match fund our short term construction land development loans  we have attempted  where possible  to extend the maturities of our deposits which typically fund our long term assets  and we have invested in securities with relatively short anticipated lives  generally three to five years 
how we measure the risk of interest rate changes 
we monitor first savings bank s interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis using proprietary software as supported by the baker group  a third party provider  which measures the change in net interest income as a percentage of net income in varying rate environments 
management uses various assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of our operations to changes in interest rates 
although management believes these assumptions are reasonable  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from these assumptions 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities lag behind changes in market interest rates 
non uniform changes and fluctuations in market interest rates across various maturities will also affect the results presented 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we consider all these factors in monitoring our interest rate exposure 
the assumptions we use are based upon a combination of proprietary and market data that reflect historical results and current market conditions 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  prepayments  deposit decay rates and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios 
we use market data as provided by the baker group to determine prepayments and maturities of loans  investments and borrowings  and use our own assumptions on deposit decay rates except for time deposits 
time deposits are modeled to reprice to market rates upon their stated maturities 
we also assume that non maturity deposits can be maintained with rate adjustments not directly proportionate to the change in market interest rates  based upon our historical deposit decay rates which are substantially lower than market decay rates 
we have demonstrated in the past that the tiering structure of our deposit accounts during changing rate environments results in relatively lower volatility and less than market rate changes in our interest expense for deposits 
we tier our deposit accounts by balance and rate  whereby higher balances within an account earn higher rates of interest 
therefore  deposits that are not very rate sensitive generally  lower balance tiers are separated from deposits that are rate sensitive generally  higher balance tiers 
when interest rates rise  we do not have to raise interest rates proportionately on less rate sensitive accounts to retain these deposits 
these assumptions are based upon our analysis of our customer base  competitive factors and historical experience 
the following table illustrates the change in the net portfolio value at december  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates equally across all maturities  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest movement

the net portfolio value is calculated based upon the present value of the discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
the difference between the present value of assets and liabilities is the net portfolio value and represents the market value of equity for the given interest rate scenario 
net portfolio value is useful for determining  on a market value basis  how much equity changes in response to various interest rate scenarios 
large changes in net portfolio value reflect increased interest rate sensitivity and generally more volatile earnings streams 
represents the increase decrease in the estimated net portfolio value at the indicated change in interest rates compared to the net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates 
calculated as the net portfolio value divided by the market value of assets anet portfolio value ratio 
calculated as the increase decrease in the net portfolio value ratio assuming the indicated change in interest rates over the estimated portfolio value of assets assuming no change in interest rates 
calculated based on the present value of the discounted cash flows from assets 
the market value of assets represents the value of assets under the various interest rate scenarios and reflects the sensitivity of those assets to interest rate changes 
when interest rates decline by basis points  our net interest income gradually increases because our earning assets are primarily long term fixed rate loans and the rate we earn decreases at a slower pace than the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities primarily borrowed funds 
interest income would decrease on our interest earning assets primarily because of increased prepayment risks that would emerge 
we expect that our interest expense would decrease proportionally to the decline in interest income because of the sensitivity of our short term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of seattle which re price daily and our money market liabilities which are tied to the day u 
s 
treasury bill rate 
furthermore  the rate we pay on the majority of our deposits and on some borrowed funds cannot decline basis points in the event of an immediate change in market interest rates  since most of our interest bearing liabilities possess some term structures 
when interest rates rise by  or basis points  our net interest income and the net portfolio value decreases because the rate we earn on our interest earning assets does not increase as rapidly as the rates we would pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
our interest earning assets primarily consist of intermediate term and longer term loans that do not reprice quickly and investments with primarily intermediate term structures 
our interest bearing liabilities generally consist of short term deposits savings  money market  and certificates of deposits and short to intermediate term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of seattle that would reprice more quickly than our interest earning assets 
the net interest income and net portfolio value tables presented above are predicated upon a stable balance sheet with no growth or change in asset or liability mix 
in addition  the net portfolio value is based upon the present value of discounted cash flows using the baker group s market analysis and our estimates of current replacement rates to discount the cash flows 
the effects of changes in interest rates in the net interest income table are based upon a cash flow simulation of our existing assets and liabilities and  for purposes of simplifying the analysis  assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
delinquency rates may change when interest rates change  as a result of changes in the loan portfolio mix  underwriting conditions  loan terms  or changes in economic conditions that have a delayed effect on the portfolio 
the model we use that is administered by the baker group does not change the delinquency rate for the various interest rate scenarios 
even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as set forth above 
also  a change in the us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve would cause changes to the net portfolio value and net interest income other than those indicated above 
liquidity we are required to have enough cash flow in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation 
we maintain cash flows above the minimum level believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
on a daily basis  we review and update cash flow projections to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained 
our primary sources of funds are from customer deposits  loan repayments  maturing investment securities and advances from the federal home loan bank of seattle 
these funds  together with equity  are used to make loans  acquire investment securities and other assets  and fund continuing operations 
while maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we believe that our current liquidity position  and our forecasted operating results are sufficient to fund all of our existing commitments 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments such as overnight deposits or mortgage backed securities 
on a longer term basis  we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products as described in greater detail under abusiness of first savings bank b lending activities 
at december   the total approved loan origination commitments outstanding amounted to million 
at the same date  the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process totaled million and unused lines of credit were million 
we use our sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments  to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals  to fund loan commitments and to maintain our portfolio of mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december  totaled million 
management s policy is to maintain deposit rates at levels that are competitive with other local financial institutions 
based on historical experience  we believe that a significant portion of maturing deposits will remain with first savings bank 
in addition  we had the ability at december  to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank of seattle as a funding source to meet commitments and for liquidity purposes 
in addition  first savings bank has available lines of credit of million with other financial institutions which could be used for liquidity 
we measure our liquidity based on our ability to fund our assets and to meet liability obligations when they come due 
liquidity and funding risk occurs when funds cannot be raised at reasonable prices  or in a reasonable time frame  to meet our normal or unanticipated obligations 
we regularly monitor the mix between our assets and our liabilities to manage effectively our liquidity and funding requirements 
our primary source of funds is our deposits 
when deposits are not available to provide the funds for our assets  we use alternative funding sources 
these sources include  but are not limited to cash management from the federal home loan bank of seattle  wholesale funding  brokered deposits  federal funds purchased and dealer repurchase agreements  as well as other short term alternatives 
alternatively  we may also liquidate assets to meet our funding needs 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate our liquidity sources and needs for the coming three month  six month  and one year time periods 
also  we determine funding concentrations and our need for sources of funds other than deposits 
this information is used by our asset liability management committee in forecasting funding needs and investing opportunities 
capital our total stockholders equity was million at december  consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization we will actively seek to maintain a awell capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards 
as of december  first savings bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
regulatory capital ratios for first savings bank were as follows as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets was  tier i capital to risk weighted assets was  and tier i capital to average assets was 
the regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized are   and  respectively 
see aitem  business b how we are regulated regulation and supervision of first savings bank b capital requirements 
commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and the unused portions of lines of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
commitments to extend credit and lines of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by us until the instrument is exercised 
at december  and  we had no commitments to originate loans for sale 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit  is based on our credit evaluation of the customer 
the amount and type of collateral required varies  but may include real estate and income producing commercial properties 
at december   commitments to originate loans  commitments under unused lines of credit  and undisbursed portions of construction loans in process  for which we were obligated amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
first financial northwest and its subsidiaries from time to time are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
there are currently no matters that in the opinion of management  which would have material adverse effect on first financial northwest s consolidated financial position  results of operation  or liquidity 
among our contingent liabilities are exposures to limited recourse arrangements with respect to sales of whole loans and participation interests 
we anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet our current commitments

these principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation on earnings  as distinct from levels of interest rates  is in the area of noninterest expense 
expense items such as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
our management is unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation
