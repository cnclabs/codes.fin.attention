the company also has successfully unitized the southwest starbuck field which includes gross acres 
the company has a working interest  a net revenue interest and has completed the initial phase of water flood operations in connection with phase two of the larger starbuck madison unit  which is in close proximity and can share certain facilities  thereby enhancing the economics of both units 
exploration and exploitation our producing properties have reasonably predictable production profiles  earnings and cash flows and thus provide a foundation for our technical staff to further develop our existing properties and also generate new projects that we believe have the potential to increase our share value 
we believe that many of our existing fields have 
table of contents 
index to financial statements exploration and exploitation potential  much of which is presently defined 
the steep and rapid decline of commodity prices in and the collapse of the capital markets have caused numerous independents to significantly reduce their capital budgets 
while we have not yet reduced our capital budget  some of our projects  particularly those that are held by production  have been deferred in favor of projects with lease expirations 
in addition  some projects in north dakota have been deferred as a result of prices being adversely affected by increased transportation and quality deductions 
in some cases  these projects were replaced by gulf coast projects with better current commodity prices 
our capital budget is discussed more fully in item the table and discussion below  while not all inclusive  present a broad range of projects and prospects in various stages of development 
exploration and exploitation acreage we attempt to establish production operations in areas of interest and expand exploration and exploitation opportunities in those fields and regional proximity thereto 
the table below is presented to summarize certain acreage positions associated with exploration and exploitation opportunities 
the acreage table is not all inclusive but summarizes the field discussions below

see discussion below 
chittim field also discussed above we have  gross and  net acres in the field 
the field presently produces out of the glen rose interval and the upside potential includes an additional three proved and probable undeveloped locations 
the maverick basin  however  has additional plays and targets including the pearsall and eagleford shale 
we have budgeted a horizontal offset well to a vertical pearsall well that produced and we believe horizontal drilling and advanced completion techniques offer the potential to make the pearsall meaningful to us 
the commercial viability of the eagleford shale is unknown and we will monitor the drilling and development 
table of contents 
index to financial statements efforts of other operators before we commit drilling dollars to development 
our acreage is held by production and therefore  we have no pending lease obligations or expirations 
driscoll field also discussed above the field was owned by conoco for much of its life and little development occurred over the last years 
we own nearly all of the working interest in this field 
we hold  gross and  net acres 
in  we initiated a field wide and regional study  which has been deferred due to our expanded activities in other areas 
initial reviews identified several re engineering and recompletion projects 
we successfully completed certain nominal re engineering and recompletion projects 
the acreage is held by production and therefore  we have no pending lease obligations or expirations 
east nesson bakken area located in mountrail county  north dakota 
we have varying working interests in the area ranging from to and net revenue interests ranging from to in approximately  acres 
this is a developing bakken formation horizontal drilling play at vertical depths of about  feet 
we are participating in an active leasehold acquisition and drilling program in a joint venture with another williston basin operator 
the leasehold generally consists of portions of tracts or governmental subdivisions that will become drilling and spacing units 
accordingly  our working and net revenue interests could be reduced proportionally to acreage contributed to a drilling unit 
to date  joint venture wells have been drilled by the operator and wells have been staked by other operators where we own minor interests 
the joint venture remains active and has continued to acquire attractive acreage 
the reduction in commodity prices which occurred has caused numerous operators to curtail or significantly reduce drilling and development operations 
we expect to continue drilling throughout with one rig 
however  in the near term  until drilling and development costs decline further  wells may include acreage where the joint venture has lower working interests in order to reduce near term capital expenditures 
to date  the joint venture gross completed well costs have been approximately million per well 
in the near term  we expect gross joint venture wells to be approximately million and to average under million in four to six months 
we intend to further increase our acreage position and participating interest as the play develops and expands 
eloi bay field complex also discussed above in addition to the proved production  this field has numerous behind pipe opportunities due to multiple stacked sand reservoirs along with four proved undeveloped locations  which are above existing production 
at present   gross and  net acres are held by production 
other operators have had drilling success and established deeper production in the area and we have budgeted funds for the acquisition and reprocessing of d seismic over the field and certain surrounding acreage to define prospective opportunities which may exist 
the hurricanes of and the reduction in commodity prices have caused us to defer data acquisition  processing and interpretation activities 
we intend to pursue prospect leads in the orderly course of business 
this acreage is held by production and  therefore  we have no pending lease obligations or expirations 
harris field also discussed above this field consists of gross and net acres and is in the early stages of water flooding with one injector well installed in additional capital was allocated in for a crestal well  but has been deferred in favor of committing drilling dollars to projects with lease obligations 
giddings field also discussed above we have implemented a development program and we are actively acquiring additional acreage 
along with our affiliated partnership  we control  gross  net acres that are held by production and an additional  gross and  net leased acres that are not currently held by production 
this field consists of multiple wells that have the potential for production rate increases through the use of fracture stimulations and proved undeveloped drilling locations 
we have drilled wells to date and achieved a success rate 
we have recently leased  federal acres 
we presently expect at least additional drilling locations and intend to retain the current drilling rig and spud a new well approximately every days 
we will consider deploying a second rig as drilling costs decline 
we are the operator of all of these wells and hold a direct working interest in the core development area of this field 
in addition  an affiliated partnership owns an working interest 
throughout the field we have an average working interest of and an incremental reversionary interest of through our affiliate partnership see partnership reserves above 
there has been significant exploration activity in regional proximity to our large acreage position in grimes county  texas  including a shallow yegua formation gas discovery  which we believe would be prospective to our acreage and justify a d seismic program  and in the deeper eagleford shale which underlies the austin chalk 
the eagleford shale is being drilled and evaluated by a number of substantially larger independents

index to financial statements landa west madison unit also discussed above we hold  gross and  net acres in the field 
these acres are held by production 
this unit has additional potential in reconfiguring its current injection pattern to increase recoveries 
mak field also discussed above we hold  gross and  net acres by production 
a completed waterflood is in place and production has continued to increase slowly over time 
the possibility of drilling infill locations in this existing waterflood is under evaluation with at least one location expected in new mexico fields also discussed above we hold  gross and  net acres by production 
these acres are held by production 
upside exists in each of the three fields  which are in various stages of waterflood redevelopment 
the fields are being studied for additional injection wells and infill producers  which we believe could enhance the waterflood upside 
northeast landa field also discussed above located in bottineau county  north dakota  the field has produced primarily from the mission canyon formation at depths of approximately  feet  feet 
we hold  gross and net acres 
cumulative primary recovery to date is approximately  barrels of oil 
seven gross wells remain on production 
this secondary recovery potential has been studied and confirmed for the eastern lobe in the mission canyon member of the madison formation 
upon recognizing the potential and extent of the floodable reservoir  we launched a leasehold and production acquisition effort to enhance our position in the field 
this effort has been successful and is continuing 
we have completed preliminary flood designs  but due to questions raised by certain working interest owners we were unable to voluntarily unitize the field in in the fourth quarter of  we drilled a key evaluation well to collect electric logs and cores for additional evidence 
core analysis and laboratory results should be available in the second quarter of at that time  we intend to commence unitization proceedings 
we expect to have the field unitized and begin water flood installation in odem field also discussed above we hold  gross and  net acres by production from multiple frio sands 
we believe numerous proved and non proved behind pipe zones exist for recompletion into shallower frio intervals 
we have d seismic data over the properties 
certain wells that were budgeted for have been deferred in favor of other opportunities 
oklahoma during  catena  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  participated in the formation of an affiliated partnership in order to acquire certain producing oil and gas properties and undeveloped acreage located throughout oklahoma 
we directly purchased of the interests  while the partnership purchased the remaining 
we believe we can exploit exploration and development opportunities associated with the acreage and in acres in close proximity to those acquired 
lower gas prices and increased differentials have reduced gas prices in many mid continent areas to less than per mcf and accordingly  drilling economics have been adversely impacted 
the undeveloped acreage includes approximately drilling locations 
most of these locations are held by production and therefore do not have expiring lease terms 
however  if the combination of high drilling and development and low prices continues this will cause us to defer or even abandon these potential drilling projects 
we are high grading drilling locations and have scheduled the drilling of the first five wells 
additional drilling is expected to be scheduled as prices stabilize and drilling costs decline 
the olson  was recently drilled and completed in roger mills county to an approximate total depth of  feet 
we have a working interest in this new productive well 
quarantine bay field also discussed above including gross and net acres acquired in january  we hold  gross and  net acres above  feet and  net acres below that depth 
upside in this field consists of numerous behind pipe opportunities due to the multiple stacked sand reservoirs  along with proved undeveloped and rate acceleration locations in the section above  feet 
in addition  we believe deeper exploration potential exists 
we have a working interest in the field  with a net revenue interest below  feet 
in cooperation with the operator  we acquired square miles of d seismic data to image and define prospect leads primarily below  feet 
schlumberger was engaged to reprocess the d seismic data and provide initial interpretive geological and geophysical services 
geophysical and subsurface evaluation is continuing and we have isolated several prospects  the majority of which are on acreage that is held by production operations 
at least one exploration well with multiple objectives below  feet is expected to be drilled in  pending commodity prices and estimated drilling costs

index to financial statements riprap coulee field this field is a bakken shale play in eastern montana 
it involves horizontal drilling at vertical depths of about  feet 
currently  we own gross and net leasehold acres in this prospect 
roth leonard fields these fields are located in bottineau county  north dakota 
the fields produce from the same mississippian madison stratigraphic porosity as the sherman and wayne fields and have similar water production and pressure histories indicating that they are also horizontal infill drilling candidates see sherman wayne fields below 
we hold  gross and  net acres 
we have a working interest and net revenue interest 
sherman wayne fields also discussed above we hold  gross and net acres and operate the field 
all of the wells are on rod pump with seven of the wells being horizontal producers 
upside  in this field  consists of two proved undeveloped horizontal infill locations 
we drilled two horizontal locations in and established commercial production 
further upside potential from horizontal drilling could result if we are able to unitize acreage with adjacent leases 
st 
martinville field also discussed above the field has produced over million barrels of oil at depths ranging from  feet to  feet since its discovery several decades ago  and has not been evaluated with a modern d survey 
we hold  gross and  net acres in the field 
a successful well was drilled in late to a depth of  feet that initially flowed over bbls d  is still producing bbls d and has several behind pipe zones 
one additional well is presently budgeted 
a d seismic survey is in process with interpretation to begin in the second half of starbuck and southwest starbuck fields also discussed above the starbuck field was unitized effective november   and includes  gross and  net acres 
we immediately began our waterflood installation and have a working interest and net revenue interest 
phase one  including four injection wells  water plant and flow lines  was completed in early  when initial water injection began 
as a result of the recent increase in the starbuck madison unit production  which is believed to be initial secondary recovery response  phase two of the three phase capital plan was initiated and completed in march using our base case  we estimate million bbls recoverable with a development cost of approximately to per barrel 
recoverable reserve estimates range from million bbls to million bbls 
the flood design includes two productive zones  the midale mississippian charles and the berentson mississippian charles b zone  which are being flooded separately 
the starbuck midale has produced  barrels of oil and the berentson has produced  barrels on primary recovery  for total field production of  barrels of oil 
fourteen gross wells are still producing 
the flood installation has been designed to capture and accelerate recovery of existing primary reserves  as well as capture incremental water flood reserves 
at the adjacent southwest starbuck field  we have completed phase one of the water flood plan which included drilling one injection well and installing a water plant and flow lines 
initial water injection commenced in mid january  the plant and flow lines will also serve the south end of the starbuck madison unit 
the initial flood design includes gross acres where we have a working interest and a net revenue interest 
we estimate that an incremental  bbls are recoverable  net to our interest 
title to properties it is customary in the oil and gas industry to make a limited review of title to undeveloped oil and gas leases at the time they are acquired 
it is also customary to obtain more extensive title examinations prior to the commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped leases or prior to the acquisition of producing oil and gas properties 
with respect to the future acquisition of both undeveloped and proved properties  we plan to conduct title examinations on such properties in a manner consistent with industry and banking practices 
we have obtained title opinions  title reports or otherwise conducted title investigations covering substantially all of our producing properties and believe we have satisfactory title to such properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry 
our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  overriding royalty interests  and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of such properties 
substantially all of our oil and gas properties are and may continue to be mortgaged to secure borrowings under bank credit facilities see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources

merger change in management  control and business strategy as discussed elsewhere in this report  we underwent a substantial change in ownership  management  voting control  assets and business strategy as a result of the acquisition of southern bay and chandler via the merger and a purchase of working interests in a chandler operated project  which closed in april for financial reporting purposes  the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of georesources  inc by southern bay 
therefore  the results of operations and cash flows presented herein for the year ended december   are those attributable to the combined entities 
the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december   are those attributable to the former southern bay entity for the entire twelve months and those of the combined entity for the period from april   through december  the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december   are those attributable to the former southern bay entity 
general we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and gas reserves through an active and diversified program which includes purchases of reserves  re engineering  development  and exploration activities 
as further discussed in this report  future growth in assets  earnings  cash flows and share values will be dependent upon our ability to effectively compete for capital and acquire  discover and develop commercial quantities of oil and gas reserves that can be produced at a profit  and assemble an oil and gas reserve base with a market value exceeding its acquisition  development and production costs 
we continue to implement our business strategy to acquire  discover and develop oil and gas reserves and achieve continued growth 
management continues to focus on reducing operating and administrative costs on a per unit basis 
in addition  we have attempted to mitigate downward price volatility by the use of commodity price hedging 
the current volatile price environment for oil and natural gas is significant  and management cannot predict the prices that will be available during the life of our current business plan 
following is a brief outline of our current plans acquire oil and gas properties with significant producing reserves and development and exploration potential  solicit industry partners in acquisitions  on a promoted basis  in order to diversify  reduce average cost and generate operating fees  implement re engineering and development programs within existing fields  pursue exploration projects and increase direct participation in projects over time 
solicit industry partners  on a promoted basis  for internally generated projects  selectively divest assets to upgrade our producing property portfolio and to lower corporate wide per unit operating and administrative costs  and focus on existing fields and new projects with greater development and exploitation potential  continue activities directed toward reducing per unit operating and general and administrative costs on a long term sustained basis  and obtain additional capital through the issuance of equity securities and or through debt financing 
while the impact and success of our corporate plans cannot be predicted with accuracy  our goal is to replace production and further increase our reserve base at an acquisition or finding cost that will yield attractive rates of return 
in addition to our fundamental business strategy  we intend to actively pursue corporate acquisitions and mergers 
management believes that opportunities may become available to acquire corporate entities or otherwise effect business combinations  particularly as a result of recent lower commodity prices and the contraction in equity and debt financing markets 
we intend to consider any such opportunities which may become available and are beneficial to stockholders 
the primary financial considerations in the evaluation of any such potential transactions

recent property acquisitions and divestitures during  we expanded our acreage positions and drilling inventory  implemented our drilling programs  and began the process of high grading the assets resulting from the merger and significant acquisitions of we sold or abandoned certain properties which  collectively had net production at the time of sale of bbls d and mcfe d  but were outside our focus areas  had limited development potential  short remaining productive lives  high maintenance requirements or significant plugging and abandonment obligations 
we also acquired producing and undeveloped properties  principally in the williston basin and in oklahoma 
a summary of this activity is as follows in january   we sold all of our interest in the grand canyon unit  a property acquired in the merger 
this property  located in otsego county  michigan  was sold to an unaffiliated party for million in cash 
at the date of sale  the carrying value of this property was equal the sales price  therefore  no gain or loss was recognized on the sale 
in february   we acquired producing properties from an unaffiliated party in the williston basin of north dakota and montana for million cash 
the acquired properties are operated by us 
in february   we sold our interests in certain non core oil and gas properties located in louisiana to unaffiliated parties for million and recognized gains of  in may   we sold seven non core fields in louisiana and texas for approximately million 
we recognized a net gain of million related to these sales 
in may   catena oil gas llc catena  a wholly owned subsidiary  participated in the formation of okla energy partners lp okla in order to acquire certain producing oil and gas properties and undeveloped acreage located throughout oklahoma 
the acquisition totaled million 
catena directly purchased of the interests and okla purchased the remaining 
catena  the general partner for okla  has a partnership interest 
under the terms of the partnership agreement  catena s general partner interest can increase to approximately pending certain performance hurdles 
in september   we acquired producing properties in oklahoma from an unaffiliated party for million in cash 
during  we identified an exploration opportunity in the paradox basin and began leasing in colorado and utah targeting the gothic shale as a newly emerging resource play with multiple objectives 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold a majority of our interest for million and recognized a gain of million 
we retained an option to participate  up to a working interest  in any future drilling on the acreage

oil and natural gas sales 
net revenues from oil and gas sales increased  or 
properties acquired from aroc energy lp in october  accounted for approximately  of the increase 
the remaining  increase resulted primarily from an increase in commodity prices and increase in production volumes

our re engineering and workover costs increased by  from  in to  in  due to an increased emphasis on restoring and enhancing existing production capabilities 
production taxes 
our production taxes increased by  or  due to increased production volumes and revenues 
the production taxes we pay are generally calculated as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales revenue before the effects of hedging 
we take full advantage of all credits and exemptions allowed in our various jurisdictions 
our production taxes for and were and  respectively  of oil and gas sales before the effects of hedging 
the rate increased slightly from mainly due to change in our portfolio of producing properties 
exploration and impairment costs 
our exploration costs were  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  in  we drilled four gross exploratory dry holes with costs incurred through december   of  wrote off undeveloped properties with a cost of  and incurred geological costs of  in  we incurred  for geological and geophysical data

exploration costs were  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  we drilled two unsuccessful exploratory wells in and none in  but we spent  for geological and geophysical data in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative costs increased  due primarily to non recurring costs associated with the merger and consulting fees associated with the merger and consulting fees associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  as well as to overall business expansion related to the merger 
expenses associated with the merger included bonus and stock based compensation totaling  legal  accounting and proxy services of  and a nasdaq listing fee of  for entry into the national global market

hedging activities in an attempt to reduce our sensitivity to oil and gas price volatility and secure favorable debt financing  we have and will likely continue to enter into hedging transactions which may include fixed price swaps  price collars  puts and other derivatives 
we believe our hedging strategy should result in greater predictability of internally generated funds  which in turn can be dedicated to capital development projects and corporate obligations

based on the estimated fair market value of our derivatives  designated as hedges at december   we expect to reclassify net gains on commodity derivatives of million into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income during the next twelve months  however  actual cash settlement gains and losses recognized may differ materially 
at december   a change in per unit commodity prices would cause the total fair value of our commodity derivative financial instruments to increase by to million or decrease by to million with similar increases or decreases in other comprehensive income loss included in stockholders equity in the balance sheet 
since we have designated all of our commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges and therefore the change in market value of the effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income  a change in fair value would not have a significant effect on net income 
however  if our hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  our net income for would have increased by million 
additionally  should commodity prices increase or decrease in the future periods by  our realized settlement gains losses on commodity derivatives  which are included in oil and gas revenues  would increase or decrease by approximately to million in in connection with the borrowing from our bank to fund the october   aroc acquisition  we also entered into a two year interest rate swap contract on million of the debt  to protect us against interest rate increases 
during  we extended the term of this interest rate swap through october   and broke the swap up into two pieces  a million swap and a million swap 
we account for the million swap as a cash flow hedge while the million swap is accounted for as a trading security 
the value of these swaps is a liability of  of which  is classified as a current liability 
we also recognized a loss of  on the million swap

index to financial statements based on the estimated fair market value of our derivatives designated as hedges at december   we expect to reclassify net losses on our million interest rate swap derivative of million into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income during the next twelve months  however  actual cash settlements may differ materially 
we do not engage in speculative trading activities and do not hedge all available or anticipated quantities of our production 
in implementing our hedging strategy we seek to effectively manage cash flow to minimize price volatility and generate internal funds available for capital development projects and additional acquisitions  ensure our ability to support our exploration activities as well as administrative and debt service obligation  and allow certain quantities to float  particularly in months with historically increased price potential 
we believe that speculation and trading activities are inappropriate for us  but also that management of realized prices is a necessary part of our strategy 
estimating the fair value of derivative instruments requires complex calculations  including the use of a discounted cash flow technique  estimates of risk and volatility  and subjective judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate 
in addition  the calculations use future market commodity prices  which although posted for trading purposes  are merely the market consensus of forecasted price trends 
the results of the fair value calculation cannot be expected to represent exactly the fair value of our commodity hedges 
we currently obtain fair value positions from our counterparties and compare that value to our internally calculated value 
our practice of comparing our value to that of our counterparties  who are more specialized and knowledgeable in preparing these complex calculations  reduces our risk of error and approximates the fair value of the contracts  as the fair value obtained from our counterparties would be the cost to us to terminate a contract at that point in time 
administrative and operating costs on an ongoing basis  we focus on cost containment efforts related to administrative and operating costs 
however  we must continue to attract and retain competent management  technical and administrative personnel to successfully pursue our business strategy and fulfill our contractual obligations 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to finance future acquisition  development and exploration activities through working capital  cash flows from operating activities  our bank credit facility  sale of non strategic assets  various means of corporate and project finance and possibly through issuance of additional securities 
in addition  we intend to continue to partially finance our drilling activities through the sale of participations to industry or institutional partners on a promoted basis  whereby we may earn working interests in reserves and production greater than our proportionate capital costs 
financing activities during have resulted in a net reduction of debt of million from the outstanding debt of million at december  during  we borrowed an additional million  assumed million of debt in the merger  and repaid the entire balance outstanding of our bank debt of million in late june  in october   we borrowed million to finance the aroc energy lp acquisition 
during the first quarter of  we repaid million in debt using cash flows from operations 
during the second quarter  we completed a private placement of common stock and warrants to acquire common stock and used the net proceeds of million plus cash flows from operations to reduce our debt by an additional million 
in the fourth quarter  we repaid million in debt using cash flows from operations

cash flows from operating activities for  net cash provided by operating activities was million  up million from this increase was directly attributable to the increase in production resulting from acquisition and development activities and increases in oil and gas prices  partially offset by increased general and administrative expense associated with operating a larger company

in  we invested million in a different oil and gas limited partnership for which we are also the general partner 
capital budget in early  we developed and reported a two year capital budget totaling million 
as the year progressed we expanded our portfolio of projects  including both new and expanded projects 
the projects were also modified based on performance and the effects of our acquisition and divestiture activities 
the overall regional focus and profile of our portfolio remained consistent with our business strategy 
in anticipation of increasing our capital spending  commensurate with our then current level of cash flows and profitability due to historically high commodity prices  in the third quarter of  we updated our projected expenditures for the detailed review of our management and board of directors 
while our intent  at that time  was to formally plan to increase our capital spending  the rapid and significant reductions in commodity prices caused us to re evaluate and in some cases  re direct our capital spending 
the table below is presented simply to disclose the nature and diversity of opportunities currently in our portfolio 
however  considering the current commodity prices  we now expect to return to our original capital budget and spend approximately to million over the course of and the remaining to million presented below are for projects that we anticipate undertaking in the near future  however  considering the significant volatility in commodity prices we have not yet set a date certain for

our current estimate of to million is predicated on prices equal to or better than the nymex forward curve  our hedge positions  reasonable success once the projects are undertaken and costs that are consistent with our estimates 
however  we are committed to generally limiting our capital spending to the company s cash flows  although in certain limited circumstances  we may utilize our borrowing capacity for development or lease saving operations 
we absolutely will not use our borrowing capacity for exploratory drilling 
additionally  in the opinion of management  we have sufficient cash flows and liquidity to fulfill all lease obligations

we believe we can spud a new well every days  utilizing one rig for a year period 
at present  we believe we have at least drilling locations  the majority of which are expected to be dual laterals 
the dual lateral configuration reduces the number of wells but also increases reserve recoveries and favorably impacts finding and development costs 
in addition  without further significant declines in commodity prices and development costs  we expect to re enter numerous well bores and extend existing laterals or drill additional laterals 
none of the possible reentries are included in the above table as all such opportunities are held by production and have no critical timing 
we may consider deploying a second drilling rig as drilling costs come down

these expenditures include replacement  repairs or additional flowlines  facilities  and or compression as well as the modification of the down hole lift method  recompletions and side track drilling 
potential expenditures associated with further expansion of acreage and prospect inventory generally within close proximity of our existing fields 
includes eight horizontal development wells or additional lateral wells within existing fields where we have interests ranging from to includes wells operated by our joint venture partner where our working interest may range from to 
this participating working interest varies based on acreage contributed to the approved drilling units 
it also includes numerous wells where our working interest is or less 
while not material financially  management has generally elected to participate in all such drilling within our focus area primarily to collect valuable technical data related to the drilling operations and reservoir characteristics 
also  it includes one bakken shale test well in montana that we presently hold a working interest 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the table above does not include all contemplated projects or inventory in our portfolio but is representative of the bulk of such activities 
in summary  our drilling and development activities include diversified opportunities intended to develop reserves and increase production 
the current exploration and development schedule presented in the table above includes i wells which have assigned proved undeveloped reserves and the potential for the development of non proved reserves excluding numerous smaller non operated interest which may be developed  ii seven exploratory test wells including two potentially high impact exploratory wells at quarantine bay  plaquemines parish  louisiana  iii bakken shale wells excluding minor non operated interests  iv water flood installation and expansion opportunities  and v seismic and acreage expenditures intended to further expand our portfolio 
the budget  as well as the timing of expenditures  is subject to change as we re evaluate alternative projects and further expand our portfolio 
further  because much of our opportunity is held by production we may shift our expenditures between regions and projects such as development versus exploration in an attempt to maximize cash flow and take advantage of regional differences in net commodity prices and service costs 
furthermore  our budget may be accelerated or deferred  pending commodity prices  drilling and service rig availability and cost and adequate staffing to effectively manage activities and control costs 
finally  certain expenditures may be deferred in favor of new opportunities 
we believe projected expenditures will result in increased production  cash flows and reserve value and will further expose us to potential upside from exploration 
we further believe any deferral of certain projects will not result in any material loss 
should we be unable to acquire new properties  capital expenditures associated with existing properties could be increased 
new accounting standards on december   the sec published the revised rules and interpretations updating its oil and gas reporting requirements 
many of the revisions are updates to definitions in existing oil and gas rules to make them consistent with the petroleum resources management system  which is a widely accepted standard for the management of petroleum resources that was developed by several industry organizations

sfas was effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after november  we elected not to adopt the fair value option provision allowed under sfas critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances  weather  politics  global economics  mechanical problems  general business conditions and other factors 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
we have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
oil and gas properties we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations 
under this method  costs to acquire oil and gas properties  drill successful exploratory wells  drill and equip development wells  and install production facilities are capitalized 
exploration costs  including unsuccessful exploratory wells  geological  geophysical as well as cost of carrying and retaining unproved properties are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of the capitalized costs associated with proved oil and gas properties are computed using the units of production method  at the field level  based on total proved reserves and proved developed reserves  respectively  as estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
oil and gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group 
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  generally on a field by field basis 
long lived assets committed by management for disposal are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value  less cost to sell 
all of our properties are located within the continental united states and the gulf of mexico 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion  impairment of our oil and natural gas properties  and asset retirement obligations 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserve quantities and future cash flows included in this report are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec and fasb 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates 
our proved reserves information included in this report is based on estimates prepared by our independent petroleum engineers  cawley  gillespie associates  inc the independent petroleum engineers evaluated of our estimated proved reserve quantities and their related future net cash flows as of december  estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ substantially from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
we continually make revisions to reserve estimates throughout the year as additional information becomes available 
we make changes to depletion rates  impairment calculations  and asset retirement obligations in the same period that changes to reserve estimates are made 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves  which estimates incorporate various assumptions and future projections 
if the estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing our net income 
such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions 
impairment of oil and gas properties we review the value of our oil and gas properties whenever management judges that events and circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be recoverable 
impairments of producing properties are determined by comparing the pretax future net undiscounted cash flows to the net book value at the end of each period 
if the net capitalized cost exceeds undiscounted future cash flows  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined based on expected future flows using discounted rates commensurate with the risks involved  using prices and costs consistent with those used for internal decision making 
different pricing assumptions or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment 
we provide for impairments on significant undeveloped properties when we determine that the property will not be developed or a permanent impairment in value has occurred 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligations aros consist primarily of estimated future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells  removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage  and land restoration in accordance with applicable local  state and federal laws 
the discounted fair value of an aro liability is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous assumptions regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a over the life of the oil and gas field 
derivative instruments and hedging activity we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we use hedging to help ensure that we have adequate cash flows to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based  in part  on our view of current and future market 
table of contents 
index to financial statements conditions 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
we primarily utilize swaps and costless collars  which are placed with major financial institutions 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivative contracts are based upon crude oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices we receive 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivatives fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the fair value gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective and is reclassified to gain loss on oil and natural gas hedging activities line item in our consolidated statements of income in the period that the hedged production is delivered 
hedge effectiveness is measured quarterly based on the relative changes in the fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
our costless collars are valued based on the counterparty s marked to market statements  which are validated by observable transactions for the same or similar commodity options using the nymex futures index 
our swaps are valued based on a discounted future cash flow model 
our primary input for the model is the nymex futures index 
our model is validated by the counterparty s marked to market statements 
the discount rate used in determining the fair values of these instruments includes a measure of nonperformance risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations each period can be impacted by our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our derivative contracts would not qualify for cash flow hedge treatment  then our consolidated statements of income could include large non cash fluctuations  particularly in volatile pricing environments  as our contracts are marked to their period end market values 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
we evaluate the ability of our counterparties to perform at the inception of a hedging relationship and on a periodic basis as appropriate 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which requires income tax positions to meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements 
under fin  tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
prior to  we recorded contingent income tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenue recognition we predominantly derive our revenue from the sale of produced oil and gas 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received 
historically  however  differences have been insignificant 
accounting for business combinations our business has grown substantially through acquisitions  and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations to date using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas no 
 business combinations  and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities  and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
effects of inflation and pricing we experienced increased costs during  and due to increased demand for oil field products and services 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry put significant pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs 
conversely  in a period of declining prices  associated cost declines are likely to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion 
material changes in prices also impact the current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans  impairment assessments of oil and gas properties  and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase  higher prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  financing partnerships or guarantees

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
in the normal course of business  we enter into derivative transactions  including commodity price collars  swaps and floors to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements 
we do not participate in these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
while the use of these arrangements limits the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements
