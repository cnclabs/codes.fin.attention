the increase in power conversion products net sales was due primarily to alternative energy application growth in asia pacific and europe 
the net sales growth of passive interconnect products was due primarily to the expansion of a consumer wireless franchise in asia pacific and europe

sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to during fiscal as compared to in fiscal goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas no 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill 

table of contents our goodwill impairment testing follows the two step process as defined in sfas no 
the first step in the process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value  an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair value based test  using the end of our third quarter as the measurement date 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results  discounted cash flows  and other assumptions 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically  projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one or more of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term could reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the results of our goodwill impairment tests indicated that the value of goodwill attributable to our canvys segment was fully impaired 
the goodwill impairment tests revealed that the carrying value of our canvys segment exceeded its fair value  and the carrying amount of goodwill of our canvys segment  exceeded the implied goodwill value as of the march   measurement date 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million and a million tax benefit related to the charge  during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the results of our goodwill impairment tests indicated that the value of goodwill attributable to our rfpd and edg segments were fully impaired 
the goodwill impairment tests revealed that the carrying values of our rfpd and edg segments exceeded their fair value  and the carrying amount of goodwill of our rfpd and edg segments  exceeded the implied goodwill value as of the february   measurement date 
as a result  we recorded pre tax goodwill impairment charges of million and million for rfpd and edg  respectively  during the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  a million tax benefit was recorded related to the goodwill impairment

other income expense other income expense was an expense of million during fiscal compared with an expense of million during fiscal the decline in expense during fiscal was due primarily to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates  a gain related to the retirement of a portion of our long term debt  and a decrease in interest expense

income tax provision the effective income tax rates during fiscal   and were   and  respectively

as of may   all of the cumulative positive earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  which amounted to million  are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to apb no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas 
due to various tax attributes that are continually changing  it is not possible to determine what  if any  tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
we are no longer subject to either us federal  state  or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal year with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal year our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are china  japan  germany  singapore  and the netherlands 
we have tax years open in singapore beginning in fiscal year  in japan beginning in fiscal year  in the netherlands  and germany beginning in fiscal year  and in china beginning in fiscal year effective june   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the application of fin would have resulted in an increase in retained earnings of million  except that the increase was fully offset by the application of valuation allowance against net operating losses 
as of the date of adoption  we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
the uncertain tax positions as of may   and may   totaled million and million  respectively 
unrecognized tax benefits of million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
the following table summarizes the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits in thousands may  may  unrecognized tax benefits  beginning of period increases decreases due to currency translation increase due to positions from prior period decrease due to positions from prior period decreases due to settlements decreases related to the expiration of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits  end of period we record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
as of may  and may   we have recorded a liability for interest and penalties of million and million  respectively 
it is reasonably possible that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits  excluding interest and penalties  in the range of to approximately million due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations within the next months

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the significant estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence  goodwill impairment testing  incomes taxes  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
their application involves more significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables 
the estimates are influenced by the following continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions  aging of receivables  individually and in the aggregate  large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas  collectability and delinquency history by geographic area  and the fact that no single customer accounts for or more of net sales 
significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million as of may   and may   respectively 
impairment of investments we hold a portfolio of investment securities and periodically assess its recoverability 
in the event of a decline in fair value of an investment  judgment is made whether the decline is other than temporary 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline is largely based on the duration of that market decline  financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer  and our cash requirements and intent to hold the investment 
if an investment is impaired and the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded 
we recognized investment impairment charges of less than million during fiscal and we recognized no investment impairment charges during fiscal inventories our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  generally using a weighted average cost method 
inventories include material  labor  and overhead costs associated with such inventories 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods held for sale 
provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation  obsolescence  the exiting of certain market segments  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demands  change in the industry  or market conditions differ from management s estimates  additional provisions may be necessary 

table of contents we recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively  which were included in cost of sales 
the provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts 
the parts were written down to estimated realizable value 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas no 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill 
our goodwill impairment testing follows the two step process as defined in sfas no 
the first step in the process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value  an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair value based test  using the end of our third quarter as the measurement date 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results  discounted cash flows  and other assumptions 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically  projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one or more of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term could reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the results of our goodwill impairment tests indicated that the value of goodwill attributable to our canvys segment was fully impaired 
the goodwill impairment tests revealed that the carrying value of our canvys segment exceeded its fair value  and the carrying amount of goodwill of our canvys segment  exceeded the implied goodwill value as of the march   measurement date 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million and a million tax benefit related to the charge  during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the results of our goodwill impairment tests indicated that the value of goodwill attributable to our rfpd and edg segments were fully impaired 
the goodwill impairment tests revealed that the carrying values of our rfpd and edg segments exceeded their fair value  and the carrying amount of goodwill of our rfpd and edg segments  exceeded the implied goodwill value as of the february   measurement date 
as a result  we recorded pre tax goodwill impairment charges of million and million for rfpd and edg  respectively  during the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  a million tax benefit was recorded related to the goodwill impairment 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets  including software  property  plant and equipment 
we assess in accordance with sfas no 
 the possibility of long lived assets being impaired when events trigger the likelihood 

table of contents impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the impaired asset is reduced to its net realizable value 
the impairment charge is recorded in operating results 
the results of our impairment tests for fiscal and indicated no impairment of our long lived assets 
warranties we offer warranties for specific products we manufacture 
we also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty 
our warranty terms generally range from one to three years 
we estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale 
we record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
each quarter  we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product by product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation 
with respect to new products  estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products  the extended warranty period  and warranty experience 
warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty 
warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures  historical experience  and other available evidence

stock compensation effective june   we adopted sfas no 
r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments  including stock options 
we estimate fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires assumptions such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life  and dividends 
compensation cost is recognized using a graded vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period  or date on which retirement eligibility is achieved  if shorter non substantive vesting period approach

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including both positive and negative evidence  in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
those factors include historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
in circumstances where we or any of our affiliates have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence  positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed by us at a minimum to overcome that negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards 
in evaluating the positive evidence available  expectations as to future taxable income would rarely be sufficient to overcome the negative evidence of recent cumulative losses  even if supported by detailed forecasts and projections 
as of may   and may   our deferred tax assets related to tax carryforwards were million and million  respectively 
the tax carryforwards are comprised of net operating loss carryforwards 
table of contents and other tax credit carryovers 
a majority of the net operating losses and other tax credits can be carried forward for a period not greater than years 
we recorded valuation allowances for substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and loss carryforwards  and tax loss carryforwards of certain non us subsidiaries 
effective june   we adopted the provisions of fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the application of fin would have resulted in an increase in retained earnings of million  except that the increase was fully offset by the application of valuation allowance against net operating losses 
as of the date of adoption  we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits

new accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement specifically requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures addressing the following how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement and its related interpretations  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
we adopted sfas during the third quarter of fiscal year the adoption of sfas had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlements fsp no 
apb  which will change the accounting treatment for convertible securities which the issuer may settle fully or partially in cash 
under fsp no 
apb  cash settled convertible securities will be separated into their debt and equity components 
the value assigned to the debt component will be the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature  and the difference between the proceeds for the convertible debt and the amount reflected as a debt liability will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
as a result  the debt will be recorded at a discount reflecting its below market coupon interest rate 
the debt will subsequently be accreted to its par value over its expected life  with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected on the income statement 
this change in methodology will affect the calculations of net income and earnings per share for many issuers of cash settled convertible securities 
fsp no 
apb will become effective for our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fsp no 
apb on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp  which amends existing guidance for determining whether an other than temporary impairment of debt securities has occurred 
fsp replaces the existing requirement that an entity s management assert it has both the intent and ability to hold an impaired security until recovery with a requirement that management assert a it does not have the intent to sell the security  and b it is more likely than not it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis 
fsp will become effective for our first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fsp on our consolidated financial statements
