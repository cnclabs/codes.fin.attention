item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless stated otherwise  references in this annual report on form k to we  us  or our refer to ariad pharmaceuticals  inc  a delaware corporation  and our subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise 
overview our vision is to transform the lives of cancer patients with breakthrough medicines 
our mission is to discover  develop and commercialize small molecule drugs to treat cancer in patients with the greatest and most urgent unmet medical need aggressive cancers where current therapies are inadequate 
our goal is to build a fully integrated oncology company focused on novel  molecularly targeted therapies to treat solid tumors and hematologic cancers  as well as the spread of primary tumors to distant sites 
our lead cancer product candidate  deforolimus  previously known as ap  is being studied in multiple clinical trials in patients with various types of cancers 
in july  we entered into a global collaboration with merck co  inc  or merck  to jointly develop and commercialize deforolimus for use in cancer 
we initiated patient enrollment in our initial phase clinical trial of deforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcoma in the third quarter of in addition  in we and merck initiated patient enrollment in phase clinical trials in patients with metastatic breast cancer  advanced endometrial cancer and advanced prostate cancer  and phase clinical trials of deforolimus in combination with other agents 
our collaboration with merck for the global development and commercialization of deforolimus anticipates that we together with merck will conduct a broad based development program in multiple potential indications 
the collaboration agreement provides that each party will fund percent of global development costs  except for certain specific costs to be funded percent by merck 
the collaboration agreement establishes responsibilities for supply of the product for development and commercial purposes  promotion  distribution and sales of the product  governance of the collaboration  termination provisions and other matters 
in addition to cost sharing provisions  the collaboration agreement provides for an up front payment by merck of million  which was paid to us in july  up to million in milestone payments based on the successful development of deforolimus in multiple potential cancer indications  of which million has been paid to us through december   and up to million in milestone payments based on achievement of specified product sales thresholds 
the upfront payment and milestone payments  when earned by us and paid by merck  are non refundable 
merck has also agreed to provide us with up to million in interest bearing  repayable  development cost advances to cover a portion of our share of global development costs  after we have paid million in global development costs and have obtained regulatory approval to market deforolimus from the fda in the united states or similar regulatory authorities in europe or japan 
the collaboration agreement provides that each party will receive percent of the profit from the sales of deforolimus in the united states  and merck will pay us tiered double digit royalties on sales of deforolimus outside the united states 
our second product candidate  ap  has entered clinical development 
we filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  for this product candidate with the fda in the fourth quarter of and initiated a phase clinical trial in patients with hematologic cancers in the second quarter of in addition to our lead development programs  we have a focused drug discovery program centered on small molecule  molecularly targeted therapies and cell signaling pathways implicated in cancer 
we also have an exclusive license to a family of patents  three in the united states and one in europe  including a pioneering us patent covering methods of treating human disease by regulating nf b cell signaling activity 
additionally  we have developed a proprietary portfolio of cell signaling regulation technologies  our argent technology  to control intracellular processes with small molecules  which may be useful in the development of therapeutic vaccines and gene and cell therapy products and which provide versatile tools for applications in cell biology  functional genomics and drug discovery research 
since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we receive no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products  and most of our revenue to date was received in connection with a joint venture we had with a major pharmaceutical company from to except for the gain on the sale of our percent interest in that joint venture in december  which resulted in net income for the year ended december   we have not been profitable since inception 
as a result of our collaboration with merck for the development and commercialization of deforolimus  we expect that our license and collaboration revenue will increase in future periods 
however  we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  including costs for clinical trials and product manufacturing  pre commercial activities  personnel and our intellectual property 
we expect such costs and operating losses will be offset in part by development cost sharing provisions and license revenue from our collaboration with merck for the development and commercialization of deforolimus 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
on september   we entered into a merger agreement with our percent owned subsidiary  ariad gene therapeutics  inc  or agti  pursuant to which agti was merged with and into ariad on september   as described in more detail in note to the accompanying financial statements 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  working capital of million and total stockholders deficit of million 
subsequently  on february   we raised net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock to institutional investors 
general our operating losses are primarily due to the costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  personnel and intellectual property protection and enforcement 
as our product development programs progress  we incur significant costs for toxicology and pharmacology studies  product development  manufacturing  clinical trials and regulatory support 
we also incur costs related to planning for potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of products  including market research and assessment 
these costs can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of product candidates in development  the stage of development of each product candidate  the number of patients enrolled in and complexity of clinical trials and other factors 
costs associated with our intellectual property include legal fees and other costs to prosecute  maintain  protect and enforce our intellectual property  which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the status of patent issues being pursued  including our on going patent litigation 
historically  we have relied primarily on the capital markets as our source of funding 
we may also obtain funding from collaborations with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and or medical device companies for development and commercialization of our product candidates  such as our collaboration with merck for the global development and commercialization of deforolimus 
these collaborations can take the form of licensing arrangements  co development or joint venture arrangements or other structures 
in addition  we utilize long term debt to supplement our funding  particularly as a means of funding investment in property and equipment and infrastructure needs 
if funding from these various sources is unavailable on reasonable terms  we may be required to reduce our operating expenses in order to conserve cash and capital by delaying  scaling back or eliminating one or more of our product development programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of revenue recognition  the carrying value of intangible assets  deferred compensation benefits for executives  and stock based compensation 
for the year ended december   we reported license and collaboration revenue of million 
license and collaboration revenue is recorded based on up front payments  periodic license payments and milestone payments received or deemed probable of receipt  spread over the estimated performance period of the license or collaboration agreement 
regarding our collaboration with merck for the development and commercialization of deforolimus  as of december   we have received an up front payment of million and we have received and or earned milestone payments totaling million 
we are recognizing revenues related to such payments on a straight line basis through  the estimated patent life of the underlying technology 
changes in development plans could impact the probability of earning future milestone payments on which revenue recognition is based 
in addition  changes in estimated performance periods  including changes in patent lives of underlying technology  could impact the rate of revenue recognition in any period 
such changes in revenue could have a material impact on our statement of operations 
at december   we reported million of intangible assets  consisting of the recorded value of the technology associated with our acquisition in september of the percent minority interest of agti that we did not previously own  as well as capitalized costs related primarily to purchased and issued patents  patent applications and licenses  net of accumulated amortization 
these costs are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying technology  patents or licenses 
changes in these lives or a decision to discontinue using the technologies could result in material changes to our balance sheet and statements of operations 
we have concluded that the carrying value of our intangible assets is not currently impaired because such carrying value does not exceed the future net cash flows expected to be generated by such intangible assets 
if we were to abandon the ongoing development of the underlying product candidates or technologies or terminate our efforts to pursue collaborations or license agreements  we may be required to write off a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
the net book value as of december  of intangible assets related to our nf b technology is  if the patentability of our nf b patents  one of which is currently the subject of litigation and reexamination proceedings  is successfully challenged and such patents are subsequently narrowed  invalidated or circumvented  we may be required to write off some or all of the net book value related to such technology 
under our deferred executive compensation plans  we are required to adjust our recorded obligations to our officers on a periodic basis based on the quoted market value of certain underlying mutual funds 
fluctuations in the quoted market value of such mutual funds can result in uneven expense charges or credits to our statements of operations 
if  for example  the quoted market prices of the underlying mutual funds were percent higher at december   we would have recognized an additional  in compensation expense in in determining expense related to stock based compensation  we utilize the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees  consultants and directors 
application of the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of factors such as the market value and volatility of our common stock  a risk free discount rate and an estimate of the life of the option contract 
fluctuations in these factors can result in adjustments to our statements of operations 
if  for example  the market value of our common stock  its volatility  or the expected life of stock options granted during the year ended december  were percent higher or lower than used in the valuation of such stock options  our valuation of  and total stock based compensation expense to be recognized for  such awards would have increased or decreased by up to   or  respectively 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recognized license and collaboration revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in license and collaboration revenue was due primarily to an increase in the revenue recognized from the merck collaboration  based on the non refundable up front and milestone payments  totaling million  paid by merck through december   in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
we entered into this collaboration with merck in july  and thus our statement of operations reflects a full year of revenue recognition in as compared to a partial year in we expect our license and collaboration revenue will increase in based on the expected receipt of additional milestone payments in accordance with the merck collaboration agreement 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or percent  to million in  compared to million in the research and development process necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product for commercialization is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
this process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
current requirements include preclinical toxicology  pharmacology and metabolism studies  as well as in vivo efficacy studies in relevant animal models of disease  manufacturing of drug product for preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply  submission of the results of preclinical studies and information regarding manufacturing and control and proposed clinical protocol to the us food and drug administration  or fda  in an investigational new drug application  or ind or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states  conduct of clinical trials designed to provide data and information regarding the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans  and submission of all the results of testing to the fda in a new drug application  or nda or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states 
upon approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities  including in some countries approval of product pricing  we may commence commercial marketing and distribution of the product 
we group our research and development  or r d  expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture product candidates  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by product candidate 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to lease  operate and maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been tracked by product candidate because the number of product candidates and projects in r d may vary from time to time and because we utilize internal resources across multiple projects at the same time 
direct external expenses are further categorized as costs for clinical programs and costs for preclinical programs 
preclinical programs include product candidates undergoing toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies and manufacturing process development required before testing in humans can begin 
product candidates are designated as clinical programs once we have filed an ind with the fda  or a similar filing with regulatory agencies outside the united states  for the purpose of commencing clinical trials in humans 
our r d expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses in  our clinical programs consisted of our development of deforolimus  for which we initiated clinical development in  and of ap  for which we initiated clinical development in prior to  we classified ap as a preclinical program 
direct external expenses for deforolimus were million in  an increase of million  as compared to the corresponding period in this increase is due to an increase in clinical trial costs of million  costs of non clinical studies of million and manufacturing costs of million in as compared to  offset in part by an increase in merck s share of expenses of million in in addition  costs for merck s services provided to the collaboration increased by million in as compared to clinical trial costs and contract manufacturing costs increased due primarily to increasing enrollment in our phase clinical trial of deforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcomas and initiation of enrollment in in phase clinical trials of deforolimus in patients with breast cancer and endometrial cancer 
costs of non clinical studies increased due to the initiation and conduct of toxicology studies of deforolimus required to support regulatory filings with the fda 
we expect our direct external expenses for deforolimus will increase in due to initiation of and enrollment of patients in new clinical trials as well as ongoing enrollment in existing clinical trials for this product candidate 
direct external expenses for our second clinical program  ap  were million in  which consisted primarily of clinical trial costs of  toxicology costs of  and contract manufacturing costs of million as we initiated enrollment in our first phase clinical trial of this product candidate 
we expect our direct external expenses for ap will increase in as we continue to enroll patients in our phase trial and perform related manufacturing and non clinical studies for this product candidate 
we incurred no direct external expenses for preclinical programs in as  during that year  no r d programs were designated as preclinical programs 
all programs other than clinical and preclinical programs are designated as discovery research and are included in all other r d expenses in the above table 
direct external expenses for preclinical programs for the period ended december  relate primarily to costs for toxicology and contract manufacturing studies for ap in support of the filing of the ind for this product candidate in late we expect to nominate our next clinical candidate  an anaplastic lymphoma kinase  or alk  inhibitor  and move it into preclinical testing in the direct external expenses to be incurred in upon nomination of this clinical candidate will be reflected in this analysis as a preclinical program 
all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to this increase is due primarily to an increase in personnel expenses of million  related to the hiring of additional r d personnel and related expenses million offset in part by reduced stock based compensation expense  resulting from previous year stock option awards fully vested prior to and forfeitures in  and an increase in overhead expenses of million due to the expiration of a sub lease agreement for a portion of our office and laboratory facility in july  as well as miscellaneous increases in lab supplies and services and professional services 
these variances were offset in part by an increase in merck s allocated share of such expenses under the terms of the collaboration agreement of million in we expect that all other r d expenses will increase in in support of continuing discovery research and product development activities 
the successful development of our product candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our drug development programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our drug development programs will commence are unavailable 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  from million in to million in professional fees increased by million to million in as compared to million in  due primarily to costs related to corporate and commercial development initiatives  including costs related to the development of systems and processes to support growth  and to our patent infringement litigations against eli lilly and company  or lilly  and amgen inc  or amgen 
personnel and related costs increased by million due to an increase in the number of personnel and salary adjustments million  offset in part by reduced stock based compensation expense  resulting from previous year stock option awards fully vested prior to and forfeitures in these increases were partially offset by an increase in merck s allocated share of such expenses under the terms of the collaboration agreement 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in reflecting primarily an expected decrease in activity related to our patent infringement litigation and certain corporate initiatives 
we expect that our operating expenses in total  net of merck s share of development costs of deforolimus  will increase in for the reasons described above 
operating expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the actual amount of any increase in operating expenses will depend on  among other things  the progress of our product development programs  including the planned increase in clinical trials and other studies related to deforolimus pursuant to our collaboration with merck  product manufacturing and increased clinical trials related to ap  and developments in our patent infringement litigation 
interest income expense interest income decreased by percent to million in from million in  as a result of lower interest yields from our cash equivalents and marketable securities and a lower average balance of funds invested in interest expense increased by percent to  in from  in  due to higher average loan balances in  as a result of our amendment of our loan agreement in march which  among other things  provided us an additional million in loan proceeds  offset in part by lower interest rates in operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in loss of million  or percent 
we also reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  an increase in net loss of million or percent  and a net loss per share of and  in and  respectively 
such increases were due primarily to the net effect of changes in r d expenses and general and administrative expenses noted above 
we expect that our loss from operations and our net loss in will increase as compared to due to the various factors described under revenue and operating expenses above 
actual losses will depend on the progress of our product development programs  the progress of our discovery research programs  the impact of commercial and business development activities and developments in our legal proceedings  among other factors 
the extent of such losses will also depend on the sufficiency of funds on hand or available from time to time  which will influence the amount we will spend on operations and capital expenditures  as well as the development timelines for our product candidates 
years ended december  and revenue we recognized license and collaboration revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in license and collaboration revenue was due primarily to the revenue recognized from the merck collaboration  based on the non refundable up front and milestone payments  totaling million  paid by merck in the third and fourth quarters of  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by million  or percent  to million in  compared to million in  as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses deforolimus was our only clinical program in and commencing in the third quarter of  the direct external expenses for deforolimus reflect our share of such expenses pursuant to the cost sharing arrangements of our collaboration with merck 
direct external expenses for deforolimus decreased by million in as compared to due primarily to the impact of merck s share of such expenses in of million  plus lower clinical trial and manufacturing costs related to a lower number of patients in trials in as compared to our preclinical program in and consisted of our second product candidate  ap  for which we filed an ind in late direct external expenses on preclinical programs will increase or decrease over time depending on the status and number of programs in this stage of development and the mix between external and internal efforts applied to such programs 
direct external expenses for preclinical programs increased by million in as compared to due primarily to the cost of certain toxicology studies and contract manufacturing we conducted for ap in in support of the filing of the ind for this product candidate in the fourth quarter of all other r d expenses decreased by million in as compared to due to the impact of merck s allocated share of such expenses of million  and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of million reflecting an increase in the useful life of leasehold improvements upon the extension of the term of the lease of our laboratory and office facility 
these favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses of million  primarily related to stock based compensation expense of  resulting from grants of stock options in and an increase in the number of personnel and related expenses of  an increase in overhead expenses of million due to the expiration of a sub lease agreement for a portion of our office and laboratory facility in july and increases in other miscellaneous expenses  including maintenance and travel 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  from million in to million in professional fees increased by million to million in as compared to million in due primarily to costs related to corporate and business development initiatives and to our patent infringement litigations against eli lilly and company  or lilly  and amgen inc  or amgen  respectively 
personnel and related costs increased by million due to an increase in the number of personnel and salary adjustments  and stock based compensation expense  resulting from grants of stock options in these increases were partially offset by decreases in miscellaneous expenses  including taxes and travel 
interest income expense interest income increased by percent to million in from million in  due to a higher average balance of funds invested in  offset in part by lower interest yields from our cash equivalents and marketable securities in interest expense decreased by percent to  in from  in  as a result of lower interest rates and lower average loan balances in compared to operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  a decrease in loss of million  or percent 
we also reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  a decrease in net loss of million or percent  and a net loss per share of and  in and  respectively 
such decreases were due primarily to the net effect of changes in r d expenses and general and administrative expenses noted above and the increase in license and collaboration revenue of million as a result of the merck collaboration 
selected quarterly financial data summarized unaudited quarterly financial data are as follows in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total license and collaboration revenue net loss net loss per share in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total license and collaboration revenue net loss net loss per share liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and investments to date primarily through sales of our common stock to institutional investors and  to a lesser extent  through issuances of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt 
we sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs 
our collaboration with merck for the development and commercialization of deforolimus provides for additional funding in the form of up front and potential milestone payments  as well as the sharing of development costs for deforolimus 
we seek to balance the level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms 
sources of funds during the years ended december   and  our sources of funds were as follows in thousands up front payment from merck  included in cash provided by operating activities maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases proceeds from long term borrowings sales issuances of common stock in common stock offerings pursuant to stock option and employee stock purchase plans our up front payment from merck of million was received pursuant to our collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of deforolimus 
this up front payment is included in cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  but is presented separately in this analysis due to the non recurring nature of this payment 
the agreement also provides for  among other things  the payment by merck of up to million in development and regulatory milestones during the remaining development of deforolimus  including million in milestone payments received through december  related to the start of various phase and the phase clinical trials  and up to million based on the achievement of specified product sales thresholds 
milestone payments  including the million in payments referred to above  are reflected as a reduction of cash used in operating activities in uses of funds later in this analysis 
we manage our marketable securities portfolio to provide cash for payment of our obligations 
we purchase marketable securities to enhance our yield on invested funds and when such amounts are not needed for near term payment of obligations 
we generally hold our marketable securities to maturity 
upon maturity of such marketable securities  a portion may be retained as cash to provide for payment of current obligations while the remainder will be reinvested in accordance with our investment policy 
for the years ended december   and  proceeds from maturities of marketable securities  purchases of marketable securities and the resulting net amount retained as cash for payment of obligations or reinvested were as follows in thousands proceeds from maturities of marketable securities purchases of marketable securities the amount of funding we raise through sales of our common stock depends on many factors  including  but not limited to  the status and progress of our product development programs  projected cash needs  availability of funding from other sources  our stock price and the status of the capital markets 
in and  we completed sales of our common stock for net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
we had no common stock financings in the following table details our common stock sales in and number of shares price per share net cash proceeds in thousands october  march  we have filed shelf registration statements with the sec  from time to time  to register shares of our common stock or other securities for sale  giving us the opportunity to raise funding when needed or otherwise considered appropriate 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  various series of debt securities and or warrants to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units  with a total value of up to million  from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offerings 
this filing was declared effective on february  in march  we sold  shares of our common stock to azimuth opportunity ltd 
pursuant to an equity financing facility between the parties dated february  we received aggregate gross proceeds from this sale of million  or million net of issuance expenses 
these shares were registered under our shelf registration statement filed on january  the equity financing facility expired on september  following this sale  and as of december   we had million of securities available for sale under our shelf registration statement 
in march  we amended our existing term loan with a bank 
the amendment provided for an increase of million in our loan balance to million  the extension of the maturity date from march  to march   and changes to the repayment provisions 
the amended terms of the loan require us to maintain at least million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the agreement also contains certain covenants that restrict additional indebtedness  additional liens  and sales of assets  and dividends  distributions or repurchases of common stock 
at december   the balance outstanding on our term loan agreement was million 
uses of funds the primary uses of our cash are to fund our operations and working capital requirements and  to a lesser degree  to repay our long term debt  to invest in intellectual property and to invest in our property and equipment as needed for our business 
our uses of cash during the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities less up front payment from merck adjusted net cash used in operating activities repayment of long term borrowings investment in intangible assets investment in property and equipment net cash provided by used in operating activities is comprised of our net losses  adjusted for non cash expenses  deferred revenue  including deferrals of the up front and milestone payments received from merck  and working capital requirements 
adjusted net cash used in operating activities excludes the favorable impact of the non recurring  up front payment from merck of million in the third quarter of pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
as noted above  our net loss increased in  due primarily to the increased costs of advancing our product candidates through clinical phases of development  expansion of business and commercial development initiatives and patent litigation  and decreased in  due primarily to the favorable impacts of the merck collaboration 
our adjusted net cash used in operating activities as presented above varied from year to year for the same reasons  including the favorable impact of milestone payments received from merck of million in and million in as noted above  we expect that our net loss will increase in due to ongoing development of our product candidates 
however  we expect that our milestone payments from merck related to development of deforolimus will also increase and such increase will more than offset the impact of the increase in net loss on our cash used in operating activities 
thus  we expect that our net cash used in operating activities will decrease in when compared to we expect that our investment in intangible assets  consisting of our intellectual property will increase in in support of our product development activities 
we also expect that our investment in property and equipment will decrease in due to completion of certain renovations in and fewer needs for replacement of equipment in off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities for financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we maintained an outstanding letter of credit of  in accordance with the terms of our long term lease for our office and laboratory facility 
contractual obligations we have substantial fixed contractual obligations under various research and licensing agreements  consulting and employment agreements  lease agreements and long term debt agreement 
these contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december in thousands payments due by period total in through through after long term debt operating leases employment agreements other long term obligations long term debt consists of scheduled principal payments on such debt 
interest on our long term debt is based on variable interest rates 
assuming a constant interest rate of percent  the interest rate on our debt at december   over the remaining term of the debt  our interest expense would total approximately  in other long term obligations are comprised primarily of obligations under our deferred executive compensation plans and license agreements 
the license agreements generally provide for payment by us of annual license fees  milestone payments and royalties upon successful commercialization of products 
all license agreements are cancelable by us 
the above table reflects remaining license fees for the lives of the agreements but excludes milestone and royalty payments  as such amounts are not probable or estimable at this time 
liquidity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities and working capital is primarily attributable to operating losses and changes in working capital requirements 
on february   we raised net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock from our existing shelf registration statement 
following this transaction  we have approximately million of securities remaining available for issuance under our existing shelf registration statement 
based on our current operating plans  including the continued clinical development of deforolimus  in conjunction with merck  and ap  we expect to incur a net loss for the year ending december  in the range of million to million 
in addition  we expect to receive approximately million in milestone payments from merck in related to the start of various phase and phase clinical trials of deforolimus 
accordingly  we expect to report cash used in operating activities for the year ending december  in the range of million to million 
while we believe that the milestone payments from merck will be received as forecasted  we do have contingency plans in place should the receipt of the milestone payments be deferred into the first part of  which plans focus on the reduction of spending on non critical research and development activities 
based on these plans and projections  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december  and the million in net proceeds raised in february are sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months 
there are numerous factors that are likely to affect our spending levels  including the extent of clinical trials and other development activities for deforolimus in collaboration with merck  the timing and amount of milestone payments to be received from merck  the rate of enrollment of patients in clinical trials for deforolimus and ap  the progress of our discovery research and preclinical programs  the impact of potential business development activities  and developments in our nf b patent litigation and reexamination proceedings  among other factors 
these variables could result in higher or lower spending levels which could impact the sufficiency of our current funds if we are to continue operations in accordance with our current plans and achieve our intended timelines for development 
in any event  we will require substantial additional funding for our r d programs  including preclinical development and clinical trials  for operating expenses  including intellectual property protection and enforcement  for the pursuit of regulatory approvals  and for establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
in order to fund our needs  we may  among other things  sell our securities through public or private offerings as market conditions permit  enter into new long term debt or other credit agreements  enter into or amend partnership agreements for development and commercialization of our product candidates  and or license our cell signaling technologies  including our argent and nf b intellectual property portfolios 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted  and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations  strategic alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties  we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis  we may be required to delay  limit  reduce or terminate preclinical studies  clinical trials or other clinical development activities for one or more of our product candidates  delay  limit  reduce or terminate our discovery research or preclinical development activities  or delay  limit  reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates

sfas no 
establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value 
this hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly through market corroboration  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value 
a financial asset s or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the company s marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices  which are considered level inputs within the fair value hierarchy

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our available funds in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements first in short term  highly liquid securities  with original maturities of days or less  and money market accounts 
depending on our level of available funds and our expected cash requirements  we may invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities  consisting generally of corporate debt and us government and agency securities 
maturities of our marketable securities are generally limited to periods necessary to fund our liquidity needs and may not in any case exceed three years 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
realized gains and losses on marketable security transactions  if any  are reported on the specific identification method 
interest income is recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
our investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
we believe  however  that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows generally would not be material due to the current short term nature of these investments 
in particular  at december   because our available funds were invested solely in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities with maturities of six months or less  our risk of loss due to changes in interest rates is not material 
we have a deferred executive compensation plan which provides participants with deferred compensation based on the value of certain designated mutual funds 
the fair value of our obligations under this program is reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
in the event of a hypothetical percent increase in the fair market value of the underlying mutual funds as of december   we would have incurred approximately  of additional compensation expense for the year ended december  at december   we had million outstanding under a bank term note which bears interest at prime or  alternatively  libor to percent 
this note is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a hypothetical percent increase in the interest rate on which the loan is based basis points at december   we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense per year based on expected balances over the next twelve months
