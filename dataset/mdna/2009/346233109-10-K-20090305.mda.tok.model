table of contents background prior to december   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of temple inland inc on december   temple inland distributed all our issued and outstanding shares of common stock to its stockholders 
as a result of the spin off  our financial statements prior to reflect the historical accounts of the real estate development  minerals and fiber operations contributed to us and have been derived from the historical financial statements and accounts of temple inland 
in  we operated our first full year as a stand alone public company and the following discussion and analysis reflect the post spin results of operations and the effect on our financial condition 
strategy our strategy is to maximize and grow long term stockholder value through entitlement and development of real estate  realization of value from minerals and fiber resources  and growth through strategic and disciplined investment in our business 
on february   we announced the following strategic initiatives to enhance shareholder value generate significant cash flow  principally from the sale of approximately  acres of higher and better use hbu timberland  reduce debt by approximately million  and repurchase up to of our common stock 
the debt reduction and share repurchases will be funded by proceeds from the assets sales 
results of operations for the years ended  and net income was  or per diluted share in  compared with  or per diluted share in and  or per diluted share in a summary of our consolidated results follows for the year in thousands revenues real estate mineral resources fiber resources total revenues segment earnings real estate mineral resources fiber resources total segment earnings items not allocated to segments general administrative share based compensation interest expense other non operating income income before taxes income tax expense net income 
table of contents significant aspects of our results of operations follow real estate segment earnings declined principally due to a continued decrease in the sales of residential real estate  decreased commercial sales activity  increased costs associated with environmental remediation  and asset impairments 
mineral resources segment earnings increased as a result of bonus payments received for leasing over  net mineral acres 
this leasing activity was located principally in east texas and was driven by our proximity to the cotton valley  james lime and haynesville natural gas formations 
mineral resources segment earnings also benefited from increased production volumes from new well activity and higher average oil and gas prices 
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of costs associated with the continued development of corporate functions as well as start up costs necessary as a stand alone public company 
share based compensation expense increased primarily due to accelerated expense recognition in conjunction with awards granted to retirement eligible employees  and an increase in the number of participants in our plan 
interest expense increased as a result of higher debt levels and higher borrowing costs 
net income decreased as a result of the overall decline in the housing industry and a reduction in activity within our mineral resources segment 
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of costs associated with the development of corporate functions as a stand alone company 
interest expense increased principally as a result of higher debt levels 
net income increased due to the continued strength for new housing in the markets in which we operate and increased activity within our mineral resources segment 
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of costs associated with the segmentation of the real estate business within temple inland 
current market conditions current market conditions in the residential development industry are extremely difficult due to the oversupply of housing  declining sales volume for existing and new homes  flat to declining sales prices and a significant tightening of mortgage credit 
consumer confidence is near or at an all time low 
many home builders are experiencing liquidity shortfalls and are unwilling or unable to close committed lot purchases 
all geographic markets and products have not been affected to the same extent or with equal severity  but most have experienced declines 
it is likely these conditions will continue throughout current market conditions in the oil and gas industry have declined as oil and gas commodity prices have decreased from recent highs 
exploration and production companies have reduced capital expenditures for lease acquisition and production due to lower world wide demand and higher inventories resulting in lower oil and gas commodity prices 
these conditions may impact the demand for new mineral leases  new exploration activity and the amount of royalty revenues we receive 
pulpwood demand in our markets is stable 
pulpwood prices in our market areas have increased modestly due to pulp mill demand and wet weather conditions 
sawtimber prices have declined due to the decrease in demand for lumber products consistent with the decline in the housing industry 

table of contents business segments in first quarter  we changed our reportable segments to reflect our post spin management of the operations transferred to us from temple inland 
all prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
we manage our operations through three business segments real estate  mineral resources  and fiber resources 
we evaluate performance based on earnings before unallocated items and income taxes 
segment earnings consist of operating income and equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures  less minority interest expense in consolidated ventures 
unallocated items consist of general and administrative expense  share based compensation  other non operating income and expense  and interest expense 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the accounting policy note to the consolidated financial statements 
we operate in cyclical industries 
our operations are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions including changes in interest rates  availability of mortgage credit  consumer sentiment  new housing starts  real estate values  employment levels  changes in the market prices for oil  gas  and timber  and the overall strength or weakness of the us economy

in  operating expenses principally consist of  in property taxes  and  related to employee compensation and benefits 
we eliminated our historical one month lag in accounting for our investment in our two largest real estate ventures as financial information became more readily available 
the one time effect of eliminating this one month lag was to increase our equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures in by about  revenues in our owned and consolidated ventures consist of for the year in thousands residential real estate commercial real estate undeveloped land commercial operating properties other total revenues units sold in our owned and consolidated ventures consist of for the year residential real estate lots sold revenue per lot sold commercial real estate acres sold revenue per acre sold undeveloped land acres sold revenue per acre sold residential real estate revenues principally consist of the sale of single family lots to national  regional and local homebuilders

we expect difficult housing markets and credit conditions throughout commercial real estate revenues in included  from three sales aggregating acres on which we recognized income of  in  commercial real estate revenues included  from two sales aggregating acres on which we recognized income of  as market conditions for residential and commercial real estate continued to deteriorate in  we allocated additional internal resources and focused our strategic marketing efforts toward sale of our undeveloped land 
as a result  we sold  acres from our owned and consolidated ventures at an average price of  per acre  generating  in undeveloped land sales revenues in in  undeveloped land sales revenues decreased compared to as a result of significant tightening of credit standards

at year end  we have about  net acres under lease and about  net acres held by production 
a summary of our mineral resources results follows for the year in thousands revenues operating expenses equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures segment earnings

b includes leases in primary lease term only 
c acres being held by production are producing oil or gas in paying quantities 
d texas and louisiana net acres are calculated as the gross number of surface acres multiplied by our percentage ownership of the mineral interest 
alabama and georgia net acres are calculated as the gross number of surface acres multiplied by our estimated percentage ownership of the mineral interest based on county sampling 
we also have a percent nonparticipating royalty interest in groundwater produced or withdrawn for commercial purposes or sold from approximately million acres in texas  louisiana  georgia and alabama 
we have not received any income from this interest 
fiber resources our fiber resources segment focuses principally on the management of our timber holdings

items not allocated to segments unallocated items represent income and expenses managed on a company wide basis and include general and administrative expenses  share based compensation  other non operating income and expense and interest expense 
in and  the increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances and higher borrowing costs 
in  the increase in share based compensation expense was a result of recognizing accelerated expense for retirement eligible employees and fully vested awards to members of our board of directors  and from an increase in the number of participants in our plan 
in and  share based compensation was allocated from temple inland and represents the expense of temple inland share based awards granted to our employees 
in and  the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increased costs associated with implementing corporate functions as a stand alone public company 

table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate  which is income tax as a percentage of income before taxes  was percent in  percent in and percent in the rate reflects a benefit from increased percentage depletion deduction related to our mineral activities and a federal income tax rate change for qualified timber gains due to the food  conservation and energy act of we anticipate that our effective tax rate in will be about percent due to our announced strategic initiatives and the expiration in june of special tax rates for qualified timber gains under the food  conservation and energy act of we have not provided a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset because we believe it is likely it will be recoverable in future periods 
capital resources and liquidity sources and uses of cash we operate in cyclical industries and our cash flows fluctuate accordingly 
our principal operating cash requirements are for the acquisition and development of real estate  either directly or indirectly through ventures  taxes  interest  and compensation 
our principal sources of cash are proceeds from the sale of real estate and timber  the cash flow from minerals and commercial operating properties  and borrowings 
operating cash flows are affected by the timing of the payment of real estate development expenditures and the collection of proceeds from the eventual sale of the real estate  the timing of which can vary substantially depending on many factors including the size of the project  state and local permitting requirements  and availability of utilities 
working capital is subject to operating needs  the timing of sales of real estate and timber  the timing of collection of mineral royalties or mineral lease payments  collection of receivables  reimbursement from utility or improvement districts  and the payment of payables and expenses

the senior credit facility provides for releases of real estate provided that borrowing base compliance is maintained 
as a result of current financial market conditions  we closely monitor the banks in our senior credit facility 
we have not experienced any difficulty borrowing under our credit facility to date  and we currently have no reason to believe that the participants will not be able to honor their commitments under these facilities 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
this instrument expires in and is for a total notional amount of  it is non exchange traded and is valued using third party resources and models 
under the agreement  we mitigate interest rate fluctuations by fixing the interest rate on the first  of our variable rate borrowings at percent compared with a floating interest rate of one month libor plus percent at year end 
at year end  the fair value of our interest rate instrument was a  liability that is included in other liabilities 

table of contents our senior credit facility and other debt agreements contain terms  conditions and financial covenants customary for such agreements including minimum levels of interest coverage and limitations on leverage

based on our current operating projections  we believe that we will remain in compliance with our senior credit facility covenants in the future 
however  if market conditions continue to deteriorate or continue for an extended period  we may be unable to comply with our financial covenants and may need to seek amendments  waivers or forbearance of our senior credit facility  or may need to refinance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any amendments  waivers or forbearance when  as and if needed  or if the lenders would be willing to refinance on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
any amended facilities could be on terms that are both more expensive and more restrictive than our current senior credit facility 
there can be no assurance that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default of the senior credit facility 
if a default occurs  the affected lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable 

table of contents contractual obligations at year end  contractual obligations consist of payments due or expiring by year total thereafter in thousands debt a interest payments on debt purchase obligations operating leases venture contributions total a denotes items included in our balance sheet 
interest payments on debt include interest payments related to our fixed rate debt and estimated interest payments related to our variable rate debt 
estimated interest payments on variable rate debt were calculated assuming that the outstanding balances and interest rates that existed at year end remain constant through maturity 
purchase obligations are defined as legally binding and enforceable agreements to purchase goods and services 
our purchase obligations include commitments for land acquisition and land development  engineering and construction contracts for land development and service contracts 
our commitment to support third party construction and ownership of a resort hotel  spa and golf facilities at our cibolo canyons mixed use development near san antonio  texas represents our most significant purchase obligation 
at year end  our unfunded commitment related to the cibolo canyons resort was  which is expected to be funded in our operating leases are for timberland  facilities and equipment 
in second quarter  we entered into a year agreement with palisades west llc  in which we have a percent ownership interest  to lease approximately  square feet in austin  texas 
we occupy this facility as our corporate headquarters effective in fourth quarter at year end  the remaining contractual obligation is  also included in operating leases is a long term timber lease of over  acres that has a remaining lease term of years and a remaining contractual obligation of  venture contributions represent commitments to contribute a stated amount to a venture as and when needed by the venture 
we have excluded from the table contributions that may be made in the ordinary course of business for which there is no commitment to contribute an amount that is quantifiable or identifiable to specific dates 
estimated payments related to our interest rate swap agreement are excluded from the table because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount or timing of payment obligations 
additionally  we have other long term liabilities that are not included in the table because they do not have scheduled maturities 
our sources of funding are our operating cash flows and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
our contractual obligations due in will likely be paid from operating cash flows and from borrowings under our senior credit facility

our venture partners also provide performance bonds and letters of credit 
generally these performance bonds or letters of credit would be drawn on due to lack of specific performance by us or the ventures  such as failure to deliver streets and utilities in accordance with local codes and ordinances 
cibolo canyons san antonio  texas mixed use development the cibolo canyons mixed use development consists of  acres planned to include  residential lots and commercial acres designated for multifamily and retail uses  of which lots and commercial acres have been sold at year end we have  invested in the development at year end the construction and opening of the resort hotel discussed below will satisfy a condition to our right to obtain reimbursement of certain infrastructure costs related to our mixed use development under an ad valorem tax and non resort sales and use tax public improvement financing agreement between us and a special purpose improvement district spid 
until the spid achieves an adequate tax base to support issuance of bonds  the proceeds of which will be used by the spid to reimburse us for qualified infrastructure costs  we will not include the estimated reimbursements as a reduction of our real estate cost of sales 
at year end  we have billed the spid  for qualified infrastructure costs 
these costs have been audited by the spid and approved for payment  and are included in our investment in the mixed use development 
if the resort hotel is not open and operating on july   the city of san antonio could terminate the spid and we would have no payor for reimbursement of qualified infrastructure costs 
the resort hotel is under construction and is currently scheduled to open well before july  resort hotel  spa and golf in  we entered into agreements to facilitate third party construction and ownership of the jw marriott san antonio hill country resort spa  planned to include a  room destination resort and two pga tour tournament players club golf courses

the resort hotel is under construction and is currently scheduled to open well before july  
table of contents accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results and involve significant assumptions  estimates  and judgments that are difficult to determine 
we must make these assumptions  estimates  and judgments currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results  and valuations  as well as our intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can  and probably will  differ from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates  and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
we have reviewed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales in allocating costs to real estate owned and real estate sold  we must estimate current and future real estate values 
our estimates of future real estate values sometimes must extend over periods to years from today and are dependent on numerous assumptions including our intentions and future market and economic conditions 
in addition  when we sell real estate from projects that are not finished  we must estimate future development costs through completion 
differences between our estimates and actual results will affect future carrying values and operating results 
impairment of long lived assets measuring assets for impairment requires estimating future fair values based on our intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and the residual value of assets under review  primarily undeveloped land 
depending on the asset under review  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as discounting expected future cash flows  determining resale values by market  or applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
changes in economic conditions  demand for real estate  and the projected net operating income for a specific property will inevitably change our estimates 
share based compensation we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors term of option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we have limited historical experience as a stand alone company so we utilized alternative methods in determining our valuation assumptions 
the expected life was based on the simplified method utilizing the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual life of the awards 
the expected stock price volatility was based on historical prices of our peers common stock for a period corresponding to the expected life of the options 
pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based upon the pool of participants and their expected activity 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
if needed  we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon our analysis of the timing and reversal of future taxable amounts and our history and future expectations of taxable income 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period  we will include the adjustments in the tax 
table of contents provision in our financial statements 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position  cash flow and results of operation 
pending accounting pronouncements there are three new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in or will be required to adopt in please read note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation inflation has had minimal effects on operating results the past three years 
our real estate  timber  and property and equipment are carried at historical costs 
if carried at current replacement costs  the cost of real estate sold  timber cut  and depreciation expense would have been significantly higher than what we reported 
legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business 
we believe we have established adequate reserves for any probable losses  and we do not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings should have a material adverse effect on our financial position  long term results of operations  or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that charges related to these matters could be significant to results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk is principally related to our variable rate debt 
interest rate changes impact earnings due to the resulting increase or decrease in the cost of our variable rate debt  which was  at year end and  at year end the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel  and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months at year end on our variable rate debt  with comparative year end information 
this estimate assumes that debt reductions from contractual payments will be replaced with short term  variable rate debt  however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose 
at year end change in interest rates in thousands changes in interest rates affect the value of our interest rate swap agreement  notional value at year end 
we believe any change in the value of this agreement would not be significant 
foreign currency risk we have no exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
commodity price risk we have no significant exposure to commodity price fluctuations
