item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition  the discussion and the historical information contain forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  including estimates based on our judgment 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  assessing the collectability of accounts receivable  applied and unapplied production costs  production capacities  the usage and recoverability of inventories and long lived assets  including deferred income taxes  the incurrence of losses on warranty costs  stock compensation expense  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  estimations of the cost to complete for certain projects and research and development projects  estimation of the probability that the performance criteria of restricted stock awards will be met and the fair value of warrants and embedded conversion options related to convertible debentures 
our estimation of liquidity for fiscal year may be significantly different than our actual results 
negative changes in revenues will affect our estimation in cost of sales  research and development  selling  general and administrative and other aspects of our business 
executive summary we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our business and strategic plan 
subsequently  we provide a summary of some of the highlights from the recently completed fiscal year  followed by a discussion of the different aspects of our business

the gross profit within the boostcap product line increased primarily as a result of the increased off shore manufacturing of those products 
the cost reduction benefit of moving finished good manufacturing off shore began to be realized in however  the impact of those costs savings were not fully reflected in financial results until the end of as the off shore inventory took the place of the higher cost inventory 
as such  has been a process of implementing these efficiencies with the expectation that results will reflect benefits to our gross profit from cost reductions and other value based pricing strategy 
for the purpose of comparison to the previous year  in we had lower license revenue  while non reoccurring engineering revenue increased  which also added to the gross profit 
selling  general administrative sg a expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were of revenue in  compared with in  and total expense increased by million  or

other events we assess the company s goodwill and intangible assets annually or as economic conditions warrant an assessment and determined that there was no impairment 
we also assess the impairment of long term assets 
accordingly  no goodwill or other asset impairments were recognized for the years ended december   and amortization of intangibles was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from the prior years relates to the amortization of new patents in and net interest expense for the years ended december   and was  million and  respectively 
as a result of the registration rights on the shares which would be acquired upon debt conversion and warrant exercises the fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants are recorded as liabilities 
the initial fair value of million as of december  was treated as a discount to the million debenture  in addition  there was million of costs related to the issuance of the convertible debt  which are also amortized over the remaining current life of the note 
the term of the debenture may be adjusted based on the holder s election to extend the payment terms 
beginning with the first payment that was due december  the holder deferred the initial payment and may elect to defer the next four quarterly payments due in each of those payments can be deferred for a month period  with the final payment on this debt extended until december the amortization of the debt discount and deferred costs totaled million for the year ended december  and million for each of the years ended december  and the fair value calculation at december  and was impacted by the change in maxwell s stock price and a reduction in the time which the holder has to exercise their rights 
the fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants will be recalculated each reporting period and any difference in value from the prior period will be reflected in the statement of operations 
the future impact of fair value recalculations is difficult to predict  given the historical volatility of maxwell s stock price  however  it is a non cash item and does not impact cash flow 
liquidity and capital resources changes in cash flow our net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   which primarily resulted from a net loss of million and net working capital outflows of million

the net cash used in operating activities in of million was an improvement from prior years net cash used in operating activities of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and the improvement of cash used in operating activities from to of million was primarily driven by a decrease in the loss from operations of million  an improvement in the collection of receivables of million and an impact from changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
these improvements were offset by an increase in inventories of million 
although sales increased  accounts receivable actually went down in due to an improvement in collections that brought our average days sales outstanding down to days in from days in the income in accounts payable was related to the increase in inventory 
our net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december   and was the result of million in cash received from the maturities of marketable securities  offset by million in capital expenditures   in purchases of marketable securities and  in purchases of intangible assets

our net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and was the result of million in purchases of marketable securities and million in capital expenditures  offset by million in cash received from the maturities of marketable securities and  in proceeds from the sale of equipment 
capital spending has been focused on improving production processes for the high voltage and boostcap product lines 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately the same as and will be invested primarily in production equipment to increase the production capacity to meet higher customer demand of high voltage and boostcap products 
our net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   and was the result of million in proceeds from the issuance of long term and short term debt and million from the issuance of common stock  offset by million of principal payments on long term and short term debt and  from the retirement of shares 
the million from the issuance of common stock was driven by million raised through our equity distribution agreement eda

liquidity as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents with an additional million in restricted cash for a total of million 
the cash restriction will be released when the convertible debenture is repaid 
we have a million swiss francs approximately  on december  line of credit with a swiss bank for working capital  approximately  of the line was utilized as of december  in november we filed an s with the securities and exchange commission to  from time to time  sell up to an aggregate of million of the company s common stock  warrants or debt securities 
during the company received million in cash from the sale of million shares of common stock 
in august we entered into an eda with ubs securities llc ubs to  from time to time  sell up to million of our common stock 
we have received million in cash from the sale of  shares of our common stock since entering into the eda 

table of contents we continue to have cash requirements which may be adversely impacted by the diminished credit availability and extreme volatility in security prices as a result of the current deterioration in global financial markets 
if current cash balances are not sufficient to cover our activities and if additional funds are required we have several options to raise capital  which include continued sale of shares under the eda  negotiations to eliminate the current restriction on million of cash  using capital leases to finance new equipment  bridge financing and or a private placement or public offering of our common stock  a strategic partner investment  sale of various assets  or debt 
in connection with our eda and in response to the high level of volatility of securities pricing in the current marketplace we believe we will still be able to obtain additional funding in the future through our eda regardless of potential further declines in our common stock price as a result of the continued decline in the overall economy 
in addition  we have been in discussions with other financial institutions and investment banks who have expressed interest in providing additional sources of funding to the company 
the company may consider negotiations to eliminate the current restriction on million of its cash balances 
we acknowledge that eliminating this restriction may require the company to incur future economic obligations 
the company considers this a viable option to secure additional funding should other sources of credit availability diminish 
based on the company s assessment of our potential financing alternatives  we believe we will have adequate resources to fund working capital requirements  obligations as they become due  capital equipment additions and product development expenditures through the next months 
debentures  short term and long term borrowings convertible debentures on december   the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible debentures the debentures along with warrants to purchase shares of maxwell common stock 
the net proceeds of the issuance totaled approximately million after direct placement costs of approximately million 
the debenture is payable in quarterly installments of million from march through december  with the holder having the option to delay each installment months 
the holder elected to delay the first payment that was due in december the warrants initially issued were to purchase  shares of maxwell common stock while the debentures were convertible into million shares of maxwell s common stock  at any time at the option of the holder  at a strike price of per share 
the number of warrants  conversion shares and the strike price are subject to adjustment upon certain events such as the sale of equity securities by maxwell at a price below the strike price of per share 
interest is due quarterly with the interest rate tied to the federal funds rate plus per annum 
all or a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest may be paid in shares of maxwell s common stock at the company s option 
for the fiscal year ended december  we made principal payments of million with million shares of company common stock as well as million in cash and interest payments of  with  shares of company common stock as well as  in cash 
after eighteen months from the issue date  maxwell may require that a specified amount of the principal of the debentures be converted if certain conditions are satisfied for a period of consecutive trading days 
none of these conditions have occurred since the issuance of the debentures 
the change in fair value on revaluation of debenture conversion rights and warrant liabilities represents the difference between the fair value of the warrants and debenture conversion between the two measurement dates using a black scholes calculation 
the effect of the fair market value adjustment are recorded as gain loss on embedded derivative liabilities

other events in  a customer brought to our attention a possible defect in a product that was produced for maxwell under contract by another manufacturer and resold to the customer 
in an effort to resolve the matter  maxwell s subsidiary  maxwell technologies sa  initiated a legal proceeding in germany in late against the product manufacturer 
the suit is currently in the discovery phase during which time the allegedly defective product will 
table of contents be analyzed by an expert who is tasked with determining a if there is a defect  and b if there is a defect  if the defect is one stemming from manufacturing or from operating conditions 
recently the german courts held a meeting with all of the parties subject to the proceeding to confer with the expert 
at that meeting the expert did not issue any report on his findings 
in the event that a determination is made that a defect exists  any potential liability would depend upon the nature of the defect and the actual amount of any damages would be determined in a subsequent legal proceeding 
since the matter is still in its preliminary stages  we have not yet been able to determine what  if any  warranty exposure maxwell may have  and therefore  we have not recorded any warranty reserve provision 
maxwell does  however  carry insurance that may cover a portion of such warranty liability that might ultimately arise from this matter 
minority equity interests in subsidiaries purepulse  which suspended operations in and was classified as discontinued operations in  has minority equity investors 
these investors are former employees who were issued shares when purepulse originally was incorporated and former employees who have exercised stock options in that entity

purchase commitments primarily represent the value of non cancelable purchase orders and an estimate of purchase orders that if cancelled would result in a significant penalty to the company 
debt obligations represent long term and short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt of million and interest of million 
pension benefit payments represent the expected amounts to be paid for pension benefits 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to as us gaap 
we have used certain assumptions and judgments in the preparation of these financial statements  which assumptions and estimates may potentially affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
many of these items may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and  as such  management assumptions and conclusions in these areas may significantly impact the results of operations of the company 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  assessing the collectability of accounts receivable  applied and unapplied production costs  production capacities  the usage and recoverability of inventories and long lived assets  including deferred income taxes  the incurrence of losses on warranty costs  stock compensation expense  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  estimations of the cost to complete for certain projects and research and development projects  estimation of the probability that 
table of contents the performance criteria of restricted stock awards will be met and the fair value of warrants and embedded conversion options related to convertible debentures 
the markets for the company s products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving industry standards 
in addition  price competition is intense and significant price erosion generally occurs over the life of a product 
as a result of such factors  actual results could differ from the estimates used by management 
revenue recognition sales revenue is derived from the sale of manufactured products directly to customers 
for certain long term contracts  revenue is recognized at the time costs are incurred and for licensing fees we recognize revenue from the right to manufacture products based on our proprietary ultracapacitor design 
product revenue is recognized  according to the guidelines of the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab numbers revenue recognition in financial statements  and revenue recognition  when title passes to the customer at either shipment from our facilities or receipt at the customer facility  depending on shipping terms  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
if a volume discount is offered  revenue is recognized at the lowest price to the customer 
this method has been consistently applied from period to period and there is no right of return 
revenue generated from fixed price contracts is recognized at the time costs are incurred and is calculated on a percentage of completion basis measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated costs for each contract  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and is limited by the funding of the prime contractor 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
revenue generated from contracts with multiple elements is recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue to which this guidance applies includes a contract that grants a license to manufacture and market products in mainland china  using maxwell s proprietary large cell and multi cell module technology under a separate brand 
the contract obligates the manufacturer to source ultracapacitor electrode material from maxwell 
the agreement has no general right of return and allows for no refunds 
additionally  we have contracts where all the elements of the agreement need to be delivered and accepted by the customer prior to any revenue being recognized for the deliverables 
from time to time we have entered into multiple element contractual arrangements with elements of software that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
the company recognizes revenue on the delivered elements when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements exists in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop during fiscal  we entered into two contracts whereby we have delivered certain elements and vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements does not exist 
as of december   one of these contracts remained open and we have recorded approximately million of deferred revenue related to these contracts 
for contract research and development arrangements that contain up front or milestone based payments  we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method based on the percentage of costs incurred relative to the total costs estimated to be incurred to complete the contract 
revenue recognition computed under this methodology is compared with the amount of non refundable cash payments received or contractually receivable at the reporting date and the lesser of the two amounts is recognized as revenue at each reporting date 
the proportional performance methodology applied by us  utilizes an input based measure  specifically costs incurred to date  to determine proportional performance because we believe the use of an input measure is a reasonable surrogate of proportional performance compared to an output based measure  such as milestones 
amounts billed 
table of contents in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
since payments received are generally non refundable  the termination of a contract by a customer prior to its completion could result in an immediate recognition of deferred revenue relating to payments already received not previously recognized as revenue 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
finished goods and work in process inventory values include the cost of raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventory written down to market establishes a new cost basis and its value cannot be subsequently increased based upon changes in underlying facts and circumstances 
unabsorbed and underabsorbed costs are treated as expense in the period incurred 
excess and obsolete inventory in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with current and committed inventory levels 
the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving industry standards 
in addition  price competition is intense and significant price erosion generally occurs over the life of a product 
we have recorded significant charges for reserves in recent periods to reflect changes in market conditions 
we believe that future events are subject to change and revisions in estimates may have a significant adverse impact on the balance sheet and statement of operations 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires that goodwill balances undergo an annual impairment test and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the reporting unit  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities from its estimated fair value  which was calculated in step one 
the impairment charge represents the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
we cannot say with certainty that we may not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if the fair value of maxwell technologies and maxwell sa decrease due to market conditions  revisions in our assumptions or other unanticipated circumstances 
any impairment charges could adversely affect the results of our operations 
based on the financial information reviewed by management  we have one reporting unit 
convertible debenture we account for the convertible debenture and warrants in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires that the conversion feature of convertible debt be separated from the host contract and presented as a derivative instrument if certain conditions are met 
eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock and eitf  the meaning of conventional convertible debt instrument in issue no 
were also analyzed to determine whether the debt instrument is to be considered a conventional convertible debt instrument and classified in stockholders equity 
the december  valuation was used for the effective debt discount that these instruments represent 
the debt discount is amortized over the four year life of the debenture using the effective interest method 
the convertible debenture issued on december  was evaluated and determined not to be a conventional convertible debt instrument and  therefore  because of certain terms and provisions including liquidating damages under the associated registration rights agreement the embedded conversion option was 
table of contents bifurcated and has been accounted for as a derivative liability instrument 
the stock warrants issued in conjunction with the convertible debenture on december  were also evaluated and determined to be derivative instrument and  therefore  classified as liabilities on the balance sheet 
the accounting guidance also requires that the conversion feature and warrants be recorded at fair value for each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in our statement of operations 
a black scholes valuation calculation is applied to both the conversion features and warrants at the end of each period 
the valuations were used to record the fair value of these instruments at the end of the reporting periods with any difference from prior period calculations reflected in the statement of operations 
our stock price is one input used in the black scholes calculation  which has a significant impact on the calculation 
the change in our stock price will have a gain or loss effect on embedded derivative liabilities in the statement of operations 
the exercise price and the number of convertible shares  and warrants have been adjusted from the original issued amounts and continue to be subjected to an adjustment upon certain events  such as the sale of equity securities by maxwell at a price below the current exercise price 
the volatility of our stock price is likely to generate large swings in the valuations of the conversion features and warrants in future periods 
fair value measurement fasb statement no 
 the fair value option of financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
was effective january  under this standard  we are permitted to elect to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with the change in fair value recorded in earnings 
we elected not to measure any eligible items using the fair value option in accordance with sfas no 
we did not elect the fair value option for any financial instruments  therefore  sfas no 
did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
stock compensation we value stock compensation based on the fair value recognition provisions of revised financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the estimated grant date fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period 
the expense recognition provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to unvested awards that are outstanding on the effective date and awards subsequently modified or cancelled 
estimated compensation expense for awards outstanding at the effective date are being recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pension we account for the retirement plan for its swiss subsidiary as a defined benefit pension plan under fasb sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires balance sheet recognition of the over funded or under funded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans 
under sfas  actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits  and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity  net of tax effects  until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
this plan is implemented under the terms of the plan as required by swiss law 
we believe that the swiss plan is adequately funded and future payments do not appear significant based on the current funding status of the plan 

table of contents the swiss defined benefit pension plan is similar to our us defined contribution plan k in that we do not have any access to this asset  approximately to of the contributions are made by the employees and the plan is regulated by the swiss government 
in addition  we do not have any access or rights to this pension asset 
the pension asset is being reported to comply with accounting pronouncements that require us to disclose the amount on our balance sheet because the company can make excess distribution to employees and may be able to absorb future losses from decreases in plan assets or increases in benefit obligation 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for our swiss subsidiary is the local currency 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates on the balance sheet dates 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
any translation adjustments resulting from this process are shown separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reported in other income expense  net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for any of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition

fsp apb requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate

 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf mandates a two step process for evaluating whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to the entity s own stock 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  which is our first quarter of many of the warrants issued by the company contain a strike price adjustment feature  which upon adoption of eitf  will result in the instruments no longer being considered indexed to the company s own stock 
accordingly  adoption of eitf will change the current classification from equity to liability and the related accounting for many warrants outstanding at that date

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we have not entered into or invested in any instruments that are subject to market risk  except as follows foreign currency risk our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiary in switzerland 
maxwell sa has euro and local currency swiss francs revenue and operating expenses as well as loans in swiss francs 
changes in 
table of contents these currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of revenue  expenses and debt 
the company has certain long term contracts in a currency other than us dollars 
a change of basis points or in the customer local currency would impact the value of the contracts by approximately  we do not hedge our currency exposures 
interest rate risk at december   we had approximately million in debt  of which  was classified as long term debt 
we do not anticipate significant interest rate swings in the near future 
however  if they occur it may affect the consolidated balance sheet or the statement of operations 
the estimated impact on earnings or cash flow during the next fiscal year from a change of basis points in the interest rate would have a  effect on our related interest expense 
fair value risk we record an adjustment on our convertible debenture adjusting the fair value of the embedded conversion options and stock warrants 
the change in the value of these instruments is primarily impacted by the price of our stock at the end of each reporting period 
this adjustment creates a non cash effect on our statement of operations which may have a significant impact
