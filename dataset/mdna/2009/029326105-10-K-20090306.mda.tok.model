you are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward looking statement 
any such statement speaks only as of the date of this report  and in the case of any documents that may be incorporated by reference  as of the date of those documents 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or release any revisions to any forward looking statements  to report any new information  future event or other circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as required by law

critical accounting policies general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
we use historical loss data  peer group experience and the economic environment as factors  among others  in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan and lease portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
other estimates that we use are related to the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of the credit loss risk in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that a loss has occurred at the balance sheet date and such loss can be reasonably estimated  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued on impaired loans based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual risk  loss events  or changes in other factors  occur 
the analysis of the allowance uses a historical loss view as one indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
if the allowance for loan and lease losses falls below that deemed adequate by reason of loan and lease growth  actual losses  the effect of changes in risk ratings  or some combination of these factors  the company has a strategy for supplementing the allowance for loan and lease losses  over the short term 
for further information regarding our allowance for loan and lease losses  see allowance for loan and lease losses activity discussion later in this item stock based compensation the company recognizes compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of all share based payments which consist of stock options granted to directors and employees 
the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant and amortized over the service period using a black scholes merton based option valuation model that requires the use of assumptions 
critical assumptions that affect the estimated fair value of each option include expected stock price volatility  dividend yields  option life and the risk free interest rate 
goodwill business combinations involving the company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  goodwill is assessed for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually following the year of acquisition 
the company performed an evaluation of the goodwill  recorded as a result of the bank of amador acquisition  during the fourth quarter of and determined that there was no impairment 
while the company believes all assumptions utilized in its assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in earnings  the effective tax rate  historical earnings multiples and the cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows 
income taxes the company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries 
the allocation of income tax expense benefit represents each entity s proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes using the balance sheet method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
on the consolidated balance sheet  net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets 
since january  the company has accounted for uncertainty in income taxes under financial accounting standards board the fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
under the provisions of fin  only tax positions that met the more likely than not recognition threshold on january  were recognized or continue to be recognized 
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which  based on all available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes  if any 
tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination 
the election has been made to record interest expense related to tax exposures in tax expense  if applicable  and the exposure for penalties related to tax exposures in tax expense  if applicable

results of operations net interest income and net interest margin net interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on interest earning assets loans  securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing depots in other banks over the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
the company s fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was in and in the fully taxable equivalent net interest income was down  in compared to the fully taxable equivalent interest income component decreased from  in to  in  representing a decrease 
the decrease in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for compared to the same period in is comprised of two components rate down  and volume up 
the decline in rates can be attributed to decreases implemented by the company on the loans and leases during the latter part of and in response to the federal reserve board the frb decreases in the federal funds and discount rates 
decreases by the frb have resulted in ten rate reductions totaling basis points since september in addition  an increased level of nonaccrual loans resulted in foregone interest income of approximately  during as compared to  in the overall decreasing interest rate environment and the negative effect of the nonaccrual loans resulted in a basis point decrease in the yield on average earning assets from for to for the volume increase occurred despite a slight  decrease in average earning assets from  during to  during as a result of a shift in balances from lower earning investments to higher earning loans 
the change in the mix of average earning assets resulted from the company s decision to use the proceeds from principal reductions and maturing investment securities to provide funding for loan growth 
this strategy has reduced the average balances on investment securities by  or from  during to  during  while average loan balances increased  or from  during to  during the company s ability to increase its average loans is the result of its continued concentrated focus on business lending and the purchase of a  pool of loans secured by properties located in the company s market area from another bank 
the fully taxable equivalent interest income component decreased from  in to  in  representing a decrease 
the decrease in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for compared to the same period in is broken down by rate up  and volume down 
the rate increase can be attributed to an increase in the yield on the investment portfolio from in to in the increase in yield results from matured short term securities with lower yields being redirected to reduce borrowings and fund the growth in loans and leaving the investment portfolio with longer maturity higher yielding investments  thus an overall higher average yield on the existing portfolio 
the volume decrease was the result of a decrease in average earning assets 
the company made a decision to use the proceeds from principal reductions and maturing investment securities to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings and provide funding for loan growth 
this strategy reduced the average balances on investment securities by from  during to  during average balances of other borrowings were down  and average loan balances were up  during the same time period 
the increase in average loans is the result of concentrated focus on business lending 
interest expense decreased  in compared to the average balances of interest bearing liabilities were  higher in the compared to the higher balances accounted for a  increase in interest expense 
average borrowings were up  as the company used borrowings as a funding source for the increased loan balances as average deposit balances declined 
average deposit balances decreased  from  during to  during although the number of deposit relationships and accounts remains relatively stable  the average balances in those accounts have experienced a decrease over the past twelve months 
as a result of the lower overall interest rate environment the decrease in rates accounted for a  reduction in interest expense in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from to from to 
the rate on average borrowings dropped basis points during that same time period from to 
interest expense increased  in compared to the increase in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase of  in interest expense 
the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points on a year over year basis and was a result of the higher overall interest rate environment 
a drop in average balances reduced much of this increase due to higher rates 
the average balances on interest bearing liabilities were  lower in versus the lower balances accounted for a  decrease in interest expense 
in  average interest bearing deposits were up  but other borrowings were down  creating the overall drop in interest bearing balances 
in  the company focused on reducing the higher cost borrowings  the decrease in other borrowings accounting for  in reduced interest costs from volume compared to the company also focused on bringing in additional checking  money market  and savings accounts  and reducing higher priced time deposits and as a result  the average balances on interest checking  money market and savings accounts were up  adding  to interest expense attributable to the increased volume  while the average time deposit balances were down  reducing the expense by  table two  analysis of net interest margin on earning assets  and table three  analysis of volume and rate changes on net interest income and expenses  are provided to enable the reader to understand the components and past trends of the company s interest income and expenses

a significant portion of the company s loans and leases are direct loans and leases made to individuals and local businesses 
the company relies substantially on local promotional activity and personal contacts by american river bank officers  directors and employees to compete with other financial institutions 
the company makes loans and leases to borrowers whose applications include a sound purpose and a viable primary repayment source  generally supported by a secondary source of repayment 
commercial loans consist of credit lines for operating needs  loans for equipment purchases  working capital  and various other business loan products 
consumer loans include a range of traditional consumer loan products such as personal lines of credit and loans to finance purchases of autos  boats  recreational vehicles  mobile homes and various other consumer items 
construction loans are generally comprised of commitments to customers within the company s service area for construction of commercial properties  multi family properties and custom and semi custom single family residences 
other real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by first trust deeds on commercial and residential properties typically with maturities from to years and original loan to value ratios generally from to 
agriculture loans consist primarily of vineyard loans and development loans to plant vineyards 
in general  except in the case of loans under sba programs or farm services agency guarantees  the company does not make long term mortgage loans  however  in  american river bank had a residential lending division to assist customers in securing most forms of longer term single family mortgage financing 
american river bank acted as a broker between american river bank s clients and the loan wholesalers 
american river bank received an origination fee for loans closed 
subprime loans generally refer to residential mortgages made to higher risk borrowers with lower credit and or income histories 
many of these subprime loans were made with adjustable interest rates that reset upward after an introductory period 
such subprime loans coupled with declines in housing prices have led to an increase in default rates resulting in many instances of increased foreclosure rates as the adjustable interest rates reset to higher levels 
the company does not have any subprime loans on its books at december  average net loans and leases in were  which represents an increase of  over the average in average net loans and leases in were  which represents an increase of  over the average in loan growth in and resulted from the continued concentrated effort to increase commercial relationships  the addition of new borrowers developed through the company s marketing efforts  and credit extensions expanded to existing borrowers 
risk elements the company assesses and manages credit risk on an ongoing basis through a total credit culture that emphasizes excellent credit quality  extensive internal monitoring and established formal lending policies 
additionally  the company contracts with an outside loan review consultant to periodically review the existing loan and lease portfolio 
management believes its ability to identify and assess risk and return characteristics of the company s loan and lease portfolio is critical for profitability and growth 
management strives to continue its emphasis on credit quality in the loan and lease approval process  through active credit administration and regular monitoring 
with this in mind  management has designed and implemented a comprehensive loan and lease review and grading system that functions to continually assess the credit risk inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
in addition  the company has taken actions to further strengthen its lending compliance management system in accordance with recommendations in connection with its compliance examination including  among other matters  enhancement of existing procedures for internal control of loan compliance functions such as maintenance of required levels of compliance training  increased monitoring of the compliance program  and identification of any compliance weaknesses 
ultimately  underlying trends in economic and business cycles may influence credit quality 
american river bank s business is concentrated in the sacramento metropolitan statistical area  which is a diversified economy  but with a large state of california government presence and employment base  in sonoma county  through north coast bank  a division of american river bank  whose business is focused on businesses within the three communities in which it has offices santa rosa  windsor  and healdsburg and in amador county  through bank of amador  a division of american river bank  whose business is focused on businesses and consumers within the three communities in which it has offices jackson  pioneer  and ione as well as a diversified residential construction loan business in numerous northern california counties 
the economy of sonoma county is diversified with professional services  manufacturing  agriculture and real estate investment and construction  while the economy of amador county is reliant upon government  services  retail trade  manufacturing industries and indian gaming 
the company has significant extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit that are secured by real estate 
the ultimate repayment of these loans is generally dependent on personal or business cash flows or the sale or refinancing of the real estate 
the company monitors the effects of current and expected market conditions and other factors on the collectability of real estate loans 
the more significant factors management considers involve the following lease rate and terms  vacancy rates  absorption and sale rates  real estate values  supply and demand factors  and rates of return  operating expenses  inflation  and sufficiency of repayment sources independent of the real estate including  in some instances  personal guarantees 
in extending credit and commitments to borrowers  the company generally requires collateral and or guarantees as security 
the repayment of such loans is expected to come from cash flow or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers 
the company s requirement for collateral and or guarantees is determined on a case by case basis in connection with management s evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing properties  residences and other real property 
the company secures its collateral by perfecting its security interest in business assets  obtaining deeds of trust  or outright possession among other means 
in management s judgment  a concentration exists in real estate loans which represented approximately of the company s loan and lease portfolio at december   up from at december  management believes that the residential land and residential construction portion of the company s loan portfolio carries more than the normal credit risk it has seen in the past several years  due primarily to severely curtailed demand for new and resale residential property  a large supply of unsold residential land and new and resale homes  and observed reductions in values throughout the company s market area 
management has responded by evaluating loans that it considers to carry any significant risk above the normal risk of collectability  and taking actions where possible to reduce credit risk exposure by methods that include  but are not limited to  seeking liquidation of the loan by the borrower  seeking additional tangible collateral or other repayment support  converting the property through judicial or non judicial foreclosure proceedings  and other collection techniques 
management currently believes that it maintains its allowance for loan and lease loss at levels adequate to reflect the loss risk inherent in its total loan portfolio 
although management believes the company s real estate concentration to have no more than the normal risk of collectability  a continued substantial further decline in the economy in general  or a continued additional decline in real estate values in the company s primary market areas in particular  could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans and require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses which could adversely affect the company s future prospects  results of operations  profitability and stock price 
management believes that its lending policies and underwriting standards will tend to minimize losses in an economic downturn  however  there is no assurance that losses will not occur under such circumstances 
the company s loan policies and underwriting standards include  but are not limited to  the following maintaining a thorough understanding of the company s service area and originating a significant majority of its loans within that area  maintaining a thorough understanding of borrowers knowledge  capacity  and market position in their field of expertise  basing real estate loan approvals not only on market demand for the project  but also on the borrowers capacity to support the project financially in the event it does not perform to expectations whether sale or income performance  and maintaining conforming and prudent loan to value and loan to cost ratios based on independent outside appraisals and ongoing inspection and analysis by the company s lending officers or contracted third party professionals 
nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans and leases management generally places loans and leases on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless the loan or lease is well secured and in the process of collection 
loans and leases are charged off when  in the opinion of management  collection appears unlikely 
the recorded investments in nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases that were days or more past due and on accrual totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
of the  in non performing loans and leases at december   there were sixteen real estate loans totaling  three commercial loans totaling  three leases totaled  and one consumer loan totaling  interest due but excluded from interest income on nonaccrual loans and leases was  during   during  and not significant during in  and  interest income recognized from payments received on nonaccrual loans and leases was not significant

there were no loan or lease concentrations in excess of of total loans and leases not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans and leases as of december  management is not aware of any potential problem loans or leases  which were accruing and current at december   where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present repayment terms 
impaired loans the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan  or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to smaller balance loans that are collectively evaluated for credit risk 
in assessing impairment  the company reviews all loans graded substandard or lower with outstanding principal balances in excess of  the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled  at december  and had a related valuation allowance of  the average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during was approximately  as of december   the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled  and had a related valuation allowance of  the average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during was approximately  there were no loans or leases considered to be impaired at december  allowance for loan and lease losses activity the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses alll to cover probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio  which is based upon management s estimated range of those losses 
the alll is established through a provision for loan and lease losses and is increased by provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries and reduced by charge offs 
actual losses for loans and leases can vary significantly from this estimate 
the methodology and assumptions used to calculate the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process 
the model assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change 
the adequacy of the alll and the level of the related provision for loan and lease losses is determined based on management s judgment after consideration of numerous factors including but not limited to i local and regional economic conditions  ii the financial condition of the borrowers  iii loan impairment and the related level of expected charge offs  iv evaluation of industry trends  v industry and other concentrations  vi loans and leases which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management  vii continuing evaluations of the performing loan portfolio  viii ongoing review and evaluation of problem loans identified as having loss potential  ix quarterly review by the board of directors  and x assessments by banking regulators and other third parties 
management and the board of directors evaluate the alll and determine its appropriate level considering objective and subjective measures  such as knowledge of the borrowers business  valuation of collateral  the determination of impaired loans or leases and exposure to potential losses

the alll is maintained by categories of the loan and lease portfolio based on loan type and loan rating  however  the entire allowance is available to cover actual loan and lease losses 
while management uses available information to recognize possible losses on loans and leases  future additions to the allowance may be necessary  based on changes in economic conditions and other matters 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s alll 
such agencies may require the company to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level believed to be adequate for known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
based on information currently available to analyze inherent credit risk  including economic factors  overall credit quality  historical delinquencies and a history of actual charge offs  management believes that the provision for loan and lease losses and the allowance for loan and lease losses are prudent and adequate 
adjustments may be made based on differences from estimated loan and lease growth  the types of loans constituting this growth  changes in risk ratings within the portfolio  and general economic conditions 
however  no prediction of the ultimate level of loans and leases charged off in future periods can be made with any certainty

market risk management overview 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its loan and deposit functions 
the goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the company is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the company to undue interest rate risk 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for the interest rate risk management policies 
the company has a risk management committee that establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
asset liability management 
activities involved in asset liability management include  but are not limited to  lending  accepting and placing deposits and investing in securities 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset liability management 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the consolidated balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
the asset liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments 
the company uses simulation models to forecast earnings  net interest margin and market value of equity 
simulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes 
using computer modeling techniques  the company is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings 
a balance sheet forecast is prepared quarterly using inputs of actual loans and leases  securities and interest bearing liabilities ie deposits borrowings positions as the beginning base 
the forecast balance sheet is processed against three interest rate scenarios 
the scenarios include a basis point rising rate forecast  a flat rate forecast and a basis point falling rate forecast which take place within a one year time frame 
the net interest income is measured during the year assuming a gradual change in rates over the twelve month horizon 
the simulation modeling indicated below attempts to estimate changes in the company s net interest income utilizing a forecast balance sheet projected from year end balances 
table twelve below summarizes the effect on net interest income nii of a basis point change in interest rates as measured against a constant rate no change scenario 
caption table twelve interest rate risk simulation of net interest as of december  dollars in thousands change in nii from current month horizon variation from a constant rate scenario 
del bp bp del 
the simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions  which might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations 
therefore  they do not reflect likely actual results  but serve as reasonable estimates of interest rate risk 
interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
a positive cumulative gap may be equated to an asset sensitive position 
an asset sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank s interest rate margin to expand 
this results as floating or variable rate loans reprice more rapidly than fixed rate certificates of deposit that reprice as they mature over time 
conversely  a declining interest rate environment will cause the opposite effect 
a negative cumulative gap may be equated to a liability sensitive position 
a liability sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank s interest rate margin to contract  while a declining interest rate environment will have the opposite effect 
inflation the impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on manufacturing  or other commercial concerns  primarily because its assets and liabilities are largely monetary 
in general  inflation primarily affects the company through its effect on market rates of interest  which affects the company s ability to attract loan customers 
inflation affects the growth of total assets by increasing the level of loan demand  and potentially adversely affects capital adequacy because loan growth in inflationary periods can increase at rates higher than the rate that capital grows through retention of earnings which may be generated in the future 
in addition to its effects on interest rates  inflation increases overall operating expenses 
inflation has not had a material effect upon the results of operations of the company during the years ended december   and liquidity liquidity management refers to the company s ability to provide funds on an ongoing basis to meet fluctuations in deposit levels as well as the credit needs and requirements of its clients 
both assets and liabilities contribute to the company s liquidity position 
federal funds lines  short term investments and securities  and loan and lease repayments contribute to liquidity  along with deposit increases  while loan and lease funding and deposit withdrawals decrease liquidity 
the company assesses the likelihood of projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual client funding needs 
commitments to fund loans and outstanding standby letters of credit at december  were approximately  and  respectively 
such loan commitments relate primarily to revolving lines of credit and other commercial loans and to real estate construction loans 
since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company s sources of liquidity consist of cash and due from correspondent banks  overnight funds sold to correspondent banks  unpledged marketable investments and loans held for sale 
on december   consolidated liquid assets totaled million or of total assets compared to million or of total assets on december  in addition to liquid assets  the company maintains short term lines of credit in the amount of  with correspondent banks 
at december   the company had  available under these credit lines 
additionally  american river bank is a member of the fhlb 
at december   american river bank could have arranged for up to  in secured borrowings from the fhlb 
these borrowings are secured by pledged mortgage loans and investment securities 
at december   the company had  available under these secured borrowing arrangements 
american river bank also has a secured borrowing arrangement with the federal reserve bank 
the borrowing can be secured by pledging selected loans and investment securities 
at december   the collateral value at the federal reserve bank was  american river bank also has informal agreements with various other banks to sell participations in loans  if necessary 
furthermore  american river bank has access to multiple wholesale funding sources 
the company serves primarily a business and professional customer base and  as such  its deposit base is susceptible to economic fluctuations 
accordingly  management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
liquidity is also affected by portfolio maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities 
the company can sell any of its unpledged securities held in the available for sale category to meet liquidity needs 
these securities are also available to pledge as collateral for borrowings if the need should arise 
american river bank can also pledge securities to borrow from the federal reserve bank and the fhlb 
among other programs and actions taken by the us treasury and other regulatory agencies  the fdic implemented the temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the financial system 
the tlgp includes the debt guarantee program the dgp 
the dgp guarantees all newly issued senior unsecured debt eg  promissory notes  unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities beginning on october  and continuing through june  for eligible debt issued by that date  the fdic will provide the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or june  american river bank is authorized to participate in the dgp and can issue approximately  of qualifying senior debt securities covered by the dgp 
as of december   american river bank has no senior unsecured debt outstanding 
the company has not determined whether to issue qualifying senior debt securities under the dgp as part of its liquidity planning for or thereafter 
the principal cash requirements of the company are for expenses incurred in the support of administration and operations 
for nonbanking functions  the company is dependent upon the payment of cash dividends from its subsidiaries to service its commitments 
the company expects that the cash dividends paid by american river bank to the company will be sufficient to meet this payment schedule 
the maturity distribution of certificates of deposit is set forth in table thirteen below for the periods presented 
these deposits are generally more rate sensitive than other deposits and  therefore  are more likely to be withdrawn to obtain higher yields elsewhere if available

off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
as of december   commitments to extend credit and letters of credit were the only financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
the company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures  swaps  options or similar instruments 
real estate commitments are generally secured by property with a loan to value ratio of to 
in addition  the majority of the company s commitments have variable interest rates 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments
