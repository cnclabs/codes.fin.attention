the company s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the company s internal management structure  which is based on operating activities 
the company evaluates performance based upon several factors  of which the primary financial measure is segment operating profit 
operating profit provides management  investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze operating performance of each business segment against historical and competitors data  although historical results  including operating profit  may not be indicative of future results  as operating profit is highly contingent on many factors  including the state of the economy and customer preferences 
this report includes information extracted from consolidated financial information that is not required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be presented in the financial statements 
certain of this information is considered non gaap financial measures as defined by sec rules 
some of these measures are as follows gross profit for a segment is comprised of its total net sales less direct costs 
segment or division operating profit is comprised of segment or division gross profit less its overhead  selling and administrative costs and depreciation  and has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are due to the omission of a general corporate expenses  b interest income earned by the company on excess cash generated by its segments  c interest expended on corporate debt necessary to finance the segments operations and capital expenditures  and d interest and fees related to sales of interests in accounts receivable 
because of these limitations  segment or division operating profit loss should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with gaap results when evaluating the company s performance 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued executive overview continued overhead is comprised of indirect costs required to support each segment s operations  and is included in cost of sales in the statements of operations  along with selling and administrative and depreciation expenses  which are reflected separately in the statements of operations 
general corporate expenses are comprised of the company s shared service centers  and include  among other items  enterprise resource planning  human resource  corporate accounting and finance  treasury  legal and executive functions 
in order to leverage the company s infrastructure  these functions are operated under a centralized management platform  providing support services throughout the organization 
the costs of these functions are included within general corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment 
several historical seasonal factors usually affect the sales and profits of the company 
the staffing services segment s sales and operating profit are always lowest in the company s first fiscal quarter due to the thanksgiving  christmas and new year holidays  as well as certain customer facilities closing for one to two weeks 
during the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year  this segment benefits from a reduction of payroll taxes when the annual tax contributions for higher salaried employees have been met  and customers increase the use of the company s administrative and industrial labor during the summer vacation period 
due to the fact that the company s fiscal year end is the last sunday closest to the end of october  periodically its fiscal year is comprised of weeks 
fiscal year was comprised of weeks 
the demand for the company s services in all segments  both domestically and in its foreign operations  is dependent upon general economic conditions 
the company s business tends to suffer during economic downturns  such as the current recession 
the slowing of the economy during the fourth quarter of fiscal has adversely affected the company s revenue and operating profit 
in fiscal  the company s consolidated net sales totaled billion and consolidated segment operating loss totaled million 
the explanations by segment for fiscal are detailed below 
staffing services the staffing services segment s net sales for fiscal increased by million  or  from the prior year 
since the sales for this segment are substantially related to the number of weeks in the fiscal period  approximately half of the sales increase was related to the extra week in the fiscal year 
the operating profit for fiscal decreased by million  or  from fiscal the decrease in operating profit in fiscal was due to a goodwill impairment charge of million in fiscal  a decrease in gross margin percentage and an increase in overhead  partially offset by the increase in net sales 
telecommunications services the telecommunications services segment s sales increased by million  or  from the fiscal year  however  the operating results decreased by million 
the decrease in operating results for fiscal was due to a decrease in gross margin percentage and increased overhead costs 
in late january  the company learned that it may not be reimbursed for certain costs estimated and recorded under an installation contract and the increase in operating loss for the year was primarily due to the losses estimated and recorded on this contract 
the increase in overhead was predominantly due to increased indirect labor and equipment costs related to this contract 
the company continues to negotiate with the customer in order for it to be reimbursed for disputed billings under this contract 
the installation work on this contract is complete 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued executive overview continued computer systems the computer systems segment s sales increased by million  or  from the fiscal year  while its operating results decreased by million  or  in fiscal the decrease in operating results in fiscal was due to a goodwill impairment charge of million in fiscal  the increased overhead costs as a result of the acquisition of lssi  which included million of severance costs and increased amortization of intangible costs related to the acquisition 
printing and other on september   the company sold the net assets of its directory systems and services and north american telephone directory publishing operations to yellow page group ypg 
the net purchase price of million was paid in cash at closing 
the transaction included the operations of volt directory systems and datanational  formerly part of the telephone directory segment  but excluded the uruguayan printing and telephone directory operations  which now comprises this new segment 
the results of operations of volt directory systems and datanational have been classified as discontinued and the prior period results have been reclassified 
the printing and other segment s sales increased by million from the fiscal year  and its operating profit increased by million in fiscal  despite a decrease in the gross margin percentage 
the company has focused  and will continue to focus  on aggressively increasing its market share while attempting to maintain margins in order to increase profits

for those contracts accounted for under sop  the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts when losses become evident 
accumulated unbilled costs on contracts are carried in inventory at the lower of actual cost or estimated realizable value 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the establishment of an allowance requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding potential losses on receivable balances 
allowances for accounts receivable are maintained based upon historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable and actual write off history 
the company also makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based upon ongoing credit evaluations  and might assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
however  since a reliable prediction of future changes in the financial stability of customers is not possible  the company cannot guarantee that allowances will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly higher or lower than the allowance established  it would require a related charge or credit to earnings 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing using fair value methodologies  which compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company performs its annual impairment testing during its second fiscal quarter  or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the impairment test may result in charges to earnings in a quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
the company generally determines the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach  which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  or the market approach  which compares the business unit s multiples of sales and ebitda to those multiples of its competitors 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company performs step two of the impairment test which allocates the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment of goodwill has occurred for such amount and is reported as a component of operating income 
if these estimates or their related assumptions used in the impairment test change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions  the company may be required to record an impairment charge in the future 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued based upon indicators of impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which included a significant decrease in market capitalization  a decline in recent operating results  and a decline in the company s business outlook primarily due to the current macroeconomic environment  the company performed an interim impairment test as of november  on each of its four segments 
the company completed step one of the impairment analysis and concluded that  as of november   the fair value of the computer systems and staffing services segments were below their respective carrying values including goodwill 
step two of the impairment test was initiated but  due to the time consuming nature  has not been completed 
the company recorded estimates of impairment in the amount of million and million  in the computer systems and staffing services segments  respectively as of november  
the company expects to complete the step two analyses in time for the first quarter form q filing 
the company considered the income  market and cost approaches in arriving at our indicators of value 
the company relied on the income and market approaches to arrive at its valuation conclusion 
the cost approach was viewed as the floor for the value of the reporting units and was calculated based on the book value of working capital 
the income approach was given greater weight than the market approach due to the lack of strongly comparable companies  the significant fluctuations in the financial markets and the lack of recently comparable transactions 
the material assumptions used for the income approach were the forecasted revenue growth by reporting unit as well as the discount rate and long term growth rate 
the company considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates used in its analyses 
for the market approach the material assumptions were financial data for comparable companies  adjusted for differences in size  diversification and profitability 
the company also considered the control premium which can be defined as the difference between fair value and market price and other qualitative factors including its low float  concentrated ownership and limited analyst coverage 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost  and depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line or accelerated methods at rates calculated to allocate the cost of the assets over their period of use 
intangible assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no

under sfas no 
 these assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  the accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset or asset group 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group 
the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued capitalized software the company s software technology personnel are involved in the development and acquisition of internal use software to be used in its enterprise resource planning system and software used in its operating segments  some of which are customer accessible 
the company accounts for the capitalization of software in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
subsequent to the preliminary project planning and approval stage  all appropriate costs are capitalized until the point at which the software is ready for its intended use 
subsequent to the software being used in operations  the capitalized costs are transferred from costs in process to completed property  plant and equipment  and are accounted for as such 
all post implementation costs  such as maintenance  training and minor upgrades that do not result in additional functionality  are expensed as incurred 
the capitalization process involves judgment as to what types of projects and tasks are capitalizable 
although the company believes the decisions made in the past concerning the accounting treatment of these software costs have been reasonable and appropriate  different decisions could materially impact financial results 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance when the financial statements are prepared  the company estimates its income taxes based on the various jurisdictions in which its business is conducted 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide income tax provision 
liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions are based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
the recognition of these provisions for income taxes is recorded in the period in which it is determined that such taxes are due 
if in a later period it is determined that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary  a reversal of the liability is recognized 
as a result  the ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease the effective tax rate and materially affect the company s operating results 
this also requires the company to estimate its current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are reflected on the balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent it believes that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
when a valuation allowance is increased or decreased  a corresponding tax expense or benefit is recorded in the statement of operations 
the deferred tax asset at november  was million  net of the valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance was recorded to reflect uncertainties about whether the company will be able to utilize some of its deferred tax assets consisting primarily of foreign net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income for the applicable jurisdictions and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be realizable 
effective october   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
there was no material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations as a result of the adoption of the provisions of fin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued securitization program on june   the company s million accounts receivable securitization program the expiring securitization program was transferred to a multi buyer program administered by pnc bank the amended securitization program 
prior to that date  under the expiring securitization program  receivables were sold from time to time by the company to volt funding  a wholly owned consolidated special purpose subsidiary of the company 
volt funding  in turn  sold to three rivers funding corporation trfco  an asset backed commercial paper conduit sponsored by mellon bank  na and unaffiliated with the company  an undivided percentage ownership interest in the pool of receivables volt funding acquired from the company 
the company accounted for the securitization of accounts receivable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets  an amendment of sfas no 
at the time a participation interest in the receivables was sold  the receivable representing that interest was removed from the condensed consolidated balance sheet no debt was recorded and the proceeds from the sale were reflected as cash provided by operating activities 
under the amended securitization program  the receivables and related borrowings remain on the balance sheet since volt funding effectively retains control over the receivables  which are no longer treated as sold assets 
accordingly  pledged receivables are included as trade accounts receivable  net  while the corresponding borrowings are included as short term borrowings on the condensed consolidated balance sheet 
primary casualty insurance program the company is insured with highly rated insurance companies under a program that provides primary workers compensation  employer s liability  general liability and automobile liability insurance under a loss sensitive program 
in certain mandated states  the company purchases workers compensation insurance through participation in state funds  and the experience rated premiums in these state plans relieve the company of any additional liability 
in the loss sensitive program  initial premium accruals are established based upon the underlying exposure  such as the amount and type of labor utilized  number of vehicles  etc 
the company establishes accruals utilizing actuarial methods to estimate the future cash payments that will be made to satisfy the claims  including an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
this process also includes establishing loss development factors  based on the historical claims experience of the company and the industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate premium liability 
in preparing the estimates  the company considers the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party actuaries  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
the insurance policies have various premium rating plans that establish the ultimate premium to be paid 
adjustments to premiums are based upon the level of claims incurred at a future date up to three years after the end of the respective policy year 
for each policy year  management evaluates the accrual and the underlying assumptions  regularly throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed 
the ultimate premium cost may be greater or less than the established accrual 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
in the event it is determined that a smaller or larger accrual is appropriate  the company would record a credit or a charge to cost of services in the period in which such determination is made 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued medical insurance program the company is self insured for the majority of its medical benefit programs 
the company remains insured for a portion of its medical program primarily hmos as well as the entire dental program 
the company provides the self insured medical benefits through an arrangement with a third party administrator 
however  the liability for the self insured benefits is limited by the purchase of stop loss insurance 
the contributed and withheld funds and related liabilities for the self insured program together with unpaid premiums for the insured programs are held in a c employee welfare benefit trust 
these amounts  other than the current provisions  do not appear on the balance sheet of the company 
in order to establish the self insurance reserves  the company utilized actuarial estimates of expected losses based on statistical analyses of historical data 
the provision for future payments is initially adjusted by the enrollment levels in the various plans 
periodically  the resulting liabilities are monitored and adjusted as warranted by changing circumstances 
should the amount of claims occurring exceed what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  liabilities might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded by the company 
legal contingencies the company is subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of the company s business 
a quarterly review is performed of each significant matter to assess any potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  a liability and an expense are recorded for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
any accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  a reassessment is performed of the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation and may revise the company s estimates 
potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the company s earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
at november   the company had cash and cash equivalents on which interest income is earned at variable rates 
at november   the company also had credit lines with various domestic and foreign banks  which provide for borrowings and letters of credit  as well as a million accounts receivable securitization program to provide the company with additional liquidity to meet its short term financing needs 
the interest rates on these borrowings and financing are variable and  therefore  interest and other expense and interest income are affected by the general level of us and foreign interest rates 
based upon the current levels of cash invested  notes payable to banks and utilization of the securitization program  on a short term basis  as noted below in the tables  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease its annual net interest expense by million  respectively 
the company has a term loan  as noted in the table below  which consists of borrowings at fixed interest rates  and the company s interest expense related to these borrowings is not affected by changes in interest rates in the near term 
the fair value of the fixed rate term loan was approximately million at november  this fair value was calculated by applying the appropriate fiscal year end interest rate to the company s present stream of loan payments 
the company holds short term investments in mutual funds for the company s deferred compensation plan 
at november   the total market value of these investments was million  all of which are being held for the benefit of participants in a non qualified deferred compensation plan with no risk to the company 
the company has a number of overseas subsidiaries and is  therefore  subject to exposure from the risk of currency fluctuations as the value of foreign currencies fluctuates against the dollar  which may impact reported earnings 
as of november   the total of the company s net investment in foreign operations was million 
the company attempts to reduce these risks by utilizing foreign currency option and exchange contracts  as well as borrowing in foreign currencies  to hedge the adverse impact on foreign currency net assets when the dollar strengthens against the related foreign currency 
as of november   the company had no outstanding exchange contracts 
the amount of risk and the use of foreign exchange instruments described above are not material to the company s financial position or results of operations and the company does not use these instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
based upon the current levels of net foreign assets  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar against these currencies at november  by would result in a pretax gain of million related to these positions 
similarly  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar against these currencies at november  by would result in a pretax loss of million related to these positions
