the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
introduction we are a leading provider of information products and planning tools that help companies plan  market and sell to targeted markets throughout the united states  or us our information products and planning tools focus on federal  state  local and educational purchasing entities  and on early stage commercial and residential infrastructure projects 
our information products and planning tools help clients proactively track their competitors  analyze market trends  and identify new market opportunities 
marketers can research government agencies and private sector businesses to effectively establish and maintain lucrative business relationships 
our clients can leverage sales leads from our database in the form of new business prospects  alerts for upcoming contracting opportunities  and from historical public and private infrastructure projects to find and win new revenue opportunities 
historically  comprehensive market intelligence was only available to large companies with the resources to perform the research and store the data themselves  or companies that could afford to hire outside firms to perform the research for them 
our unique process to collect and organize transactional information into actionable market intelligence has enabled us to make the same high value sales intelligence affordable to businesses of all sizes 
we believe our business solutions provide our clients with a distinct competitive advantage 
our information products and planning tools leverage its proprietary database  onvia dominion  which has been compiled over the last ten years  and includes comprehensive  historical and real time information on public and private infrastructure activities unavailable elsewhere in the marketplace 
public sector information within the onvia dominion database is classified and linked within four key hubs of data project history  agency research  buyer research and competitive intelligence 
our database provides information on approximately million procurement related records connected to over  companies from across approximately  government agencies and purchasing offices nationwide 
thousands of records are added to our database each day 
private sector data includes over  current and historical opportunities covering activity within the top us markets  and comprehensive information on tens of thousands of companies  including architects  developers  owners and land use attorneys 
the data collected covers high demand land use planning details  including zoning changes  development type  proposed use and key contacts for each project 
we also provide contact information for over  planning and zoning officials 
information in our database has been collected  formatted and classified by an in house team of researchers and third party providers so that our clients are able to quickly find and analyze information relevant to their businesses 
most of our revenues are currently generated from three sources subscriptions  content licenses  and management reports 
subscription based services are typically prepaid  have a minimum term of one year and revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
subscriptions are priced based upon the geographic range  nature of content purchased and the number of users 
revenue from content licenses is generated from clients who resell our business intelligence content to their customers 
content license contracts are generally multi year arrangements  and these agreements typically have a higher annual contract value than our subscription based services 
revenue from content license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue from the sale of management reports is recognized upon delivery of the report to the client 
pricing for management information reports is generally based on one or a combination of the following the number of records included in the report  the geographic range of the report  or a flat fee based on the type of report 
we also generate revenue from document download services and list rental services  and these fees are recognized upon delivery 
management overview revenues for were million up over fourth quarter revenue was flat with but was up over the third quarter of revenue growth accelerated in the latter half of due to growth in annual contract value  or acv 
acv represents the aggregate annual contract value of our client base and is a leading indicator of future revenues 
at december   acv grew to million compared to the prior year  and grew over september  annual net loss was million for  compared to net income of  for in  we eliminated two senior executive positions to reduce our cost structure in response to the weak economy 
severance in the amount of  was recorded in related to these two positions 
we also invested in expanding our acquisition sales force and new private sector content to support the onvia planning and construction  or opc 
these investments  while contributing to higher operating expenses  have fueled acv growth in and ultimately  are expected to result in revenue growth in in  net income included a million one time gain from the termination of a lease for excess office space 
at december  we had  clients  a decrease of clients compared to december   but an increase of clients compared to september  client acquisition activities in the fourth quarter of benefited from the economic stimulus activity  the recently passed economic stimulus act of  and the stalled commercial sector 
acquisition sales also benefited from our larger  more experienced sales force 
in we invested in sales and marketing in an effort to drive revenue and productivity per sales person despite the economic headwinds 
increased demand and our larger  more experienced sales force accelerated new client acquisition in the fourth quarter of  which contributed to our accelerating acv growth rate 
the other significant driver of acv is annual contract value per client  or acvc  which grew to  up compared to the fourth quarter of  but has remained flat for the last two quarters 
in  we plan to stimulate acvc growth by introducing new information products to the marketplace  and by targeting high value prospects that resemble our best customers 
the weak economy has changed our clients purchasing behavior across the board  which has led to a downward trend in overall retention rates 
this negative trend is led by small businesses in industries impacted by the soft real estate market  such as construction companies  building product manufacturers  and maintenance companies 
budgets are tight and account expansions and upgrades to value added products have slowed 
in addition  more clients are taking advantage of quarterly payment terms  which has impacted our cash flow and unearned revenue 
in the third quarter of  we started a small business sales team which leverages a new high volume  lower touch sales process intended to reduce the costs to acquire small customers  which typically have lower contract values 
as a result we have improved the profitability of our small customers in the last three months  but we have not yet achieved our profitability objectives for this team 
we will continue to evaluate the profitability and progress of this team over the near term 
in we invested million of internal resources and capital expenditures to develop new products and technologies 
during the year we launched opc  which helps architects  engineers and construction companies focused on the commercial and residential construction markets to identify opportunities for their goods and services at the very earliest stages of development 
in addition  we are in the process of developing a new content management system  or cms  and a new database platform  both of which are intended to improve the relevance of our data  create more productive operating processes  and enhance user experience 
our new cms was developed to effectively capture new types of valuable content  to improve the productivity of our research organization  to improve data accuracy  and ultimately improve client retention 
our new application and database platform is in beta  and we plan to launch it in the first half of the new platform will create a flexible and scalable product development environment  improve our database search and indexing capabilities  and enhance the user experience and usability of our information services 
the new search and indexing capabilities will dramatically improve the relevance of our information to the specific needs of our clients 
the new user interface will have an entirely different look and feel  and will integrate the commercial and government products into one robust database  which will provide the opportunity to analyze a full set of data 
the new platform is expected to serve as the basis for product development and growth in the coming years 
capital investments are expected to slow once the new platform is launched in the first half of the investments made in are expected to result in leading edge database architecture  which is intended to create a significant competitive advantage for onvia well into the future 
our annual cost of revenue increased by over last year to supply the content required for opc 
gross margin for the fourth quarter was down from in the fourth quarter of the prior year and improved to  compared to in the third quarter of application of critical accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe the following are our most significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from subscriptions  content licenses and management reports 
our subscriptions are generally annual contracts  however  we also offer  on a limited basis  extended multi year contracts to our subscription clients  and content licenses are generally multi year agreements 
subscription and content licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we also generate revenue from fees charged for management reports  document download services  and list rental services  and revenue from these types of services is recognized upon delivery 
our subscription services and management information reports are also sold together as a bundled offering 
pursuant to the provisions of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue from these bundled sales ratably between the subscription services and the management reports based on their relative fair values  which are consistent with established list prices for those offerings 
unearned revenue consists of payments received for prepaid subscriptions from our non enterprise clients whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date  as well as the invoiced portion of enterprise contracts and content licenses whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date 
internal use software we account for the costs to develop or obtain software for internal use in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position no 
 or sop  accounting for costs of computer software developed for or obtained for internal use 
as a result  we capitalize qualifying computer software costs incurred during the application development stage 
amortization of these costs begins once the product is ready for its intended use 
these capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the product  typically to years 
the amount of costs capitalized within any period is dependent on the nature of software development activities and projects in each period 
during and  we abandoned  and  respectively  related to internal use software 
the abandoned assets relate to internal use code that was initially developed to enhance the functionality of existing products and internal workflow 
we no longer believe that the code will be compatible with the new technology platform currently being developed and we believe these costs have no future value 
the  and  in abandonments represents the full unamortized value of these assets and is included in operating expenses under the general and administrative category in the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or fas r  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of stock based compensation cost over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of our stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including employee class and historical experience 
there is also significant judgment required in the estimation of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted 
please refer to the discussion of valuation assumptions in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information on the estimation of these variables 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record accounts receivable for the invoiced or earned but not invoiced portion of our enterprise contracts and content licenses once we have a signed agreement and amounts are billable pursuant to the contract terms 
we do not record a receivable for the unbilled and unearned portion of our enterprise contracts or content licenses 
as of december  and  the unbilled portion of enterprise contracts and content licenses was approximately million and million  respectively  unbilled enterprise contracts and content licenses increased as a result of increased acquisition sales and clients adopting quarterly billing terms 
accounts receivable are recorded at their net realizable value  after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts 
such allowances are determined based on a review of an aging of accounts and reflect either specific accounts or estimates based on historical incurred losses 
contractual obligations future required payments under contracts  excluding operating expenses for our lease obligations  as of december  are as follows for the periods specified payments due by period total less than year years years more than years real estate operating lease obligations purchase obligations capital lease obligations other operating lease obligations total purchase obligations relate to software development agreements  co location hosting arrangements  telecom agreements  marketing agreements and third party content agreements 
capital lease obligations relate to server equipment and related maintenance agreements 
other operating lease obligations relate to office equipment leases 
consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue years ended december  revenue subscription content license management information reports other total revenue cost of revenue gross margin sales and marketing expenses technology and development expenses general and administrative expenses idle lease accrual total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net net income loss comparison of years ended december   and revenue revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our growth rates began to slow in the fourth quarter of due to our smaller acquisition sales force and lack of significant new products since in the first half of  our growth rate was further impacted by changes we made in our sales teams focus 
with the launch of opc  we directed our sales force to prioritize building a pipeline for opc  to concentrate on cross sell and up sell activities and to deemphasize advance renewals 
we also accelerated the transfer of our first year clients to new account managers 
the combination of these decisions had a short term negative impact on new client acquisition and client retention during first half of to mitigate this short term slowing of revenue  we invested in expanding our acquisition sales force and in marketing programs to drive revenue and revenue per salesperson 
in the second half of  the economic stimulus activity  the recently passed recovery legislation  and the stalled commercial sector increased interest in public sector opportunities and revenue growth accelerated in the latter half of revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in acvc and revenue generated from our management information report products which were introduced in the increase in acvc was attributable to increased adoption of our onvia business builder product  upgrading clients into higher valued products and scheduled price increases 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our cost of revenue consists primarily of employee costs associated with collecting  categorizing and publishing our content  and also includes third party content fees and credit card processing fees 
the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase of  in third party content costs related to increased content requirements for our opc product launched in february total third party content and credit card processing fees were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
weighted average headcount on our content team was during  compared to during for the year ended december   cost of revenue increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenue increased due primarily to increases in payroll and contract labor related expenses  third party content costs  and recruiting fees 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an aggregate increase of  or 
employee costs increased by million due to an increase in weighted average headcount to during  compared to during this was offset by the decrease of  of stock based compensation expense as the estimated forfeiture rate used to calculate non cash stock based compensation expense in was increased to reflect forfeitures related to terminated employees 
additionally  recruiting expenses decreased  primarily because we placed our vice president of sales and other sales leadership positions in allocated expenses  which consist of depreciation and amortization and other facilities related expenses were  higher in because allocated expenses included accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements due to our lease termination 
allocated expenses are allocated based on headcount in the respective departments 
sales and marketing expenses were million for both the years ended december  and while sales and marketing expenses were relatively flat over the comparable periods  we did see changes in the following categories employee costs decreased by  due to lower weighted average headcount of in  compared to in non cash stock based compensation decreased  primarily because of an increase in our estimated forfeiture rate used to calculate non cash stock based compensation expense in marketing and telecom expenses decreased  and  respectively 
these decreases were offset by increases of  in allocated expenses and  in recruiting fees 
allocated expenses were higher primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation on previous leasehold improvements as mentioned above 
technology and development technology and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease is primarily attributable to decreases of  in allocated costs and  in recruiting fees 
allocated expenses decreased due to lower facilities related expenses and depreciation 
recruiting fees decreased because most of the open technology positions were filled without using outside recruiters 
these decreases were offset by increases of  in employee costs   in amortization of maintenance and license agreements and  in co location expenses 
weighted average headcount in this group decreased to in compared to in  but employee costs increased mostly due to a combined  increase in bonus incentive related to new product development milestones and accrued vacation expenses 
amortization of license and maintenance agreements increased due to increases in prepaid software agreements associated with maintaining our systems and developing the new technology platform 
co location expenses increased because we now host our web  database and transaction processing servers to a co location facility in in addition   more of internal use software development costs were capitalized in because of the development of a new technology platform initiative scheduled for release in the middle of technology and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in total was primarily attributable to increases of  in allocated expenses because of an overall increase in depreciation and amortization   in recruiting fees due to using outside recruiters to fill open technology positions and  in payroll related expenses due to severance payments to our former chief information officer  and  in travel expenses 
these costs were partially offset by an increase of  in capitalization of internal use software development costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
during  due to an assessment for past due sales taxes in the state of texas  business taxes increased by  please refer to the discussion on texas sales tax in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information 
recruiting fees increased  primarily due to the hire of our new vice president of marketing 
employee costs increased  primarily due to accrued severance for our former vice president of human resources 
relocation fees of  were incurred for the move to our new leased space as discussed in more detail under lease obligations 
bad debt expense and impairment of long lived assets increased  and  respectively 
bad debt expense increased due to an increase in the number of subscriptions being sold with payment terms 
the expense recorded for abandoned assets is discussed in more detail in internal use software under application of critical accounting policies and management estimates above 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in stock compensation of  as a result of revising our estimated forfeiture rate  and professional fees of  as we no longer had consulting fees associated with our office relocation 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
we saw increases in the following expense categories for the general and administrative group during  in payroll related expenses   in business taxes   in recruiting fees  and a write off of  in abandoned internal use software 
payroll expenses increased because of normal performance based increases and severance payments to our former general counsel 
weighted average headcount in this group was in both and business taxes increased as a result of increased revenue  and recruiting fees increased because the competitive employment market in seattle required greater use of outside recruiters to fill open positions in these increases were partially offset by decreases of  in non cash stock based compensation  and  in professional fees 
idle lease charges onvia recorded a reduction in expenses of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to our idle lease accrual 
the decrease in was to eliminate the remaining balance in our idle lease accrual as a result of the termination of our lease on our former corporate headquarters building 
the adjustment in was made to adjust our estimated accrual to the actual remaining obligation on the lease pursuant to the terms of a lease amendment in september the following table displays rollforwards of the idle lease accrual which was reduced to at december  amounts accruals at paid  net accruals at december  of sublease december  reduction income idle lease charges amounts accruals at paid  net accruals at december  of sublease december  reduction income idle lease charges other income  net other income  net consists of interest earned on our investment accounts  letter of credit fees associated with our security deposits  interest expense and other miscellaneous income or expense 
other income  net was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily attributable to a decrease in short term interest rates as compared to previous years 
interest expense was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense in and relates to capital leases for server equipment 
provision for income taxes we have incurred net operating losses  or nol  from our inception through december   with the exception of the third quarter of because of this history of net operating losses  although we recorded net operating income for the fiscal year ended december   we do not currently believe that the future realization of the tax benefit associated with these net loss carryforwards is more likely than not  therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate the likelihood that these tax benefits may be realized  and may reverse all or a portion of our valuation allowance in the future if it is determined that realization of these benefits is more likely than not 
utilization of the nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future provided by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
these ownership changes may limit the amount of nol carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax  respectively 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section of the code  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
in the future  the company plans to complete a section analysis regarding ownership changes that may have occurred  but at this time the company cannot reasonably estimate whether such a change has occurred 
any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
we currently have a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets as the future realization or the tax benefit is not more likely than not 
net income and loss for the year ended december  we reported a net loss of million  compared to net income of  and net loss of million in and  respectively 
in  we invested in expanding our acquisition sales force and in new private sector content to support the new opc product 
net income for the year ended december  includes the reversal of million of our idle lease accrual 
the change from a net income position to a net loss position is primarily related to slower revenue growth and increased operating expenses as discussed above in conjunction with the impact of the lease transactions 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   and our working capital was million 
from december  to december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million  mostly due to increased vendor payments of million related to office relocation  software licenses and third party content providers 
there were also additions to property and equipment of million and to internally developed software of million 
this is offset by the receipt of million in reimbursable tenant improvement costs and the return of our million security deposit for the lease on our former corporate headquarters 
the remaining decrease is from a  collective increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
we did not generate positive cash flow from operations in  primarily because of increased vendor payments as discussed above  lower cash receipts as planned from a reduced focus on advance renewals and a higher adoption of quarterly payment terms by our clients 
we will seek to generate positive cash flows from operations in the future via our efforts to increase client acquisition  retention and increasing our acv 
until such time as we begin generating recurring positive cash flows from operations  we will utilize our current cash and cash equivalents and current revenues to fund operations 
we expect to increase revenue from current operations by increasing our acv through a combination of expansion of our product offering and scheduled price increases 
if the continuing slowdown in the economy triggers an increase in the number of subscriptions sold with delayed payment terms  such as quarterly payment terms  our operating cash flow may be adversely impacted in the near term  however  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund current operations for the near term foreseeable future 
if we engage in merger or acquisition transactions or our overall operating plans change  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital needs  which may have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders or may include securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
we cannot make assurances that if additional financing is required  it will be available  or that such financing can be obtained on satisfactory terms 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and net cash used in operating activities of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change from net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash collected for prepaid subscriptions because of a planned reduction in advance renewals in  an increase in the number of clients receiving quarterly payment terms and an increase in vendor payments associated with our office relocation in the first quarter of the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in sales in compared to and a decrease in payments on our idle leased office space 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended  and net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities in is primarily attributable to the return of our million security deposit on the lease for our former corporate headquarters as a result of the termination of that lease and reimbursement of million in reimbursable tenant improvements 
these increases were partially offset by additions to property and equipment of million and internal use software of million 
the property and equipment purchases were primarily comprised of  in computer hardware purchases required for the development of new applications and database platform  and  in leasehold improvements for our new office building 
we do not expect to incur significant new costs associated with leasehold improvements in future quarters 
the change in net cash provided by investing activities in from net cash used in investing activities in is primarily due to an increase in sales of investments in compared to this increase was partially offset by cash outflows of million in reimbursable tenant improvements and  for a security deposit on our new office lease 
we also saw a decrease in the purchase of property and equipment in compared to financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in  and was principally related to the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and was offset during and by principal payments on capital leases 
a decrease in our stock price during resulted in a decrease in the number of option exercises compared to prior years 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

r 
in sfas no 
r  the fasb retained the fundamental requirements of sfas no 
to account for all business combinations using the acquisition method and for an acquiring entity to be identified in all business combinations 
however  the revised standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to immediately expense costs related to the acquisition 
sfas no 
r is effective for annual periods beginning on or after december  the impact that sfas no 
r will have on our consolidated financial statements when effective will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions completed after the effective date 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly  does not require any new fair value measurements 
on february   the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
we are currently evaluating the remaining provisions of sfas no 
to determine what effect its adoption on january  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will have on our financial position  cash flows  and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this fsp classifies unvested share based payment grants containing non forfeitable rights to dividends as participating securities that will be included in the computation of earnings per share 
as of december   we had no unvested share based payment grants with non forfeitable dividend rights 
we adopted fsp eitf on january   but do not expect the adoption of this fsp to have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity prices  however  we consider our exposure to these risks to be insignificant 
interest rate risk we have assessed our susceptibility to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with financial instruments 
we manage our interest rate risk by purchasing investment grade securities and diversifying our investment portfolio among issuers and maturities 
due to the fact that we carry only  in debt related to capital leases as of december   and due to our investment policies and the short term nature of our investments  we believe that our risk associated with interest rate fluctuations is negligible 
historically  our investment portfolio consisted of any or all of the following us denominated only money market funds  commercial paper  municipal securities  and corporate debt securities with remaining maturities of thirteen months or less  however  as of december   our investments consisted entirely of money market funds 
our primary investment objectives are preservation of principal  a high degree of liquidity and a maximum total return consistent with our investment objectives 
investments in us government and agency securities and money market funds investing in them are exempt from size limitations  all other securities are limited to of the portfolio at the time of purchase  per issuer 
in addition  the cumulative investments in an individual corporation  financial institution or financial institution s security are limited to million 
we consider the reported amounts of these investments to be reasonable approximations of their fair values 
foreign currency risk our foreign currency risk exposure is insignificant  because all of our sales are currently denominated in us currency 
equity price risk we do not own any equity instruments and we do not currently have plans to raise additional capital in the equity markets  therefore  our equity price risk is insignificant
