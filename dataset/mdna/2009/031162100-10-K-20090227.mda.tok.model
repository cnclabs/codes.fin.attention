overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to assist the reader in understanding the business of amgen 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we are a global biotechnology company that discovers  develops  manufactures and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology 
our mission is to serve patients 
as a science based  patient focused organization  we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness 
we operate in one business segment human therapeutics 
therefore  our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis 
we primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care  nephrology and inflammation 
our principal products include aranesp  epogen  neulasta neupogen and enbrel all of which are sold in the united states 
enbrel is marketed under a co promotion agreement with wyeth in the united states and canada 
our international product sales consist principally of european sales of aranesp and neulasta neupogen 
for additional information about our principal products  their approved indications and where they are marketed  see item business marketed products and selected product candidates 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and various us and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business in those countries 
government authorities in the united states and in other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products and our ongoing r d activities 
see government regulation 
for example  prior to obtaining regulatory approval to market a product  we must conduct extensive clinical studies designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for use in humans in the indications sought 
furthermore  in order to maintain regulatory approval to market a product  we may be required to conduct further clinical trials and to provide additional information on safety and effectiveness 
the regulatory environment is evolving and there is increased scrutiny on drug safety and increased authority being granted to regulatory bodies  in particular the fda  to assist in ensuring the safety of therapeutic products  which may lead to fewer products being approved by the fda or other regulatory bodies or 
table of contents additional safety related requirements 
safety signals  trends  adverse events or results from clinical trials  studies or meta analyses performed by us or by others including our licensees or independent investigators or from the marketed use of our products may expand safety labeling  restrict the use for our approved products or may result in additional regulatory requirements  such as requiring risk management activities  including a rems  and or additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of pmcs or a pharmacovigilance program 
see item business key developments and item business postmarketing safety activities 
most patients receiving our products are covered by either government and or private payor healthcare programs 
the reimbursement environment is evolving with greater emphasis on cost containment 
for example  we believe that the new us presidential administration  together with congress  will shape us healthcare policy in the coming months and years  and we expect that healthcare reform efforts could include long term changes to coverage and reimbursement that may have a significant impact on our business 
furthermore  due to the increasing expectations and demands of healthcare payors  we believe that we and others in our industry will be under increased pressure to further demonstrate the efficacy and economic value of our products 
therefore  sales of our products are and will continue to be affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third party payors  including government and private insurance plans and administration of those programs 
governments may regulate access to  prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies 
worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures 
further  safety signals  trends  adverse events or results from clinical trials  studies or meta analyses or from the marketed use of our products may negatively impact worldwide reimbursement for our products 
for additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business  see item business reimbursement 
for the year ended december   our total revenues were billion and net income was billion  or per share on a diluted basis 
in addition to the negative impact of the regulatory and reimbursement developments on sales of our esa products  as discussed below  our results of operations for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by charges of million for legal settlements and million in connection with our previously announced restructuring plan 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion  of which approximately billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations 
if these funds were repatriated for use in the united states  we would be required to pay additional us and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates 
our total debt outstanding was billion as of december   of which billion is due in november our cash flow from operations was billion for the year ended december  our worldwide product sales for the year ended december  were billion representing an increase of million  or  over product sales for the year ended december  this increase reflects growth primarily in enbrel and neulasta neupogen sales significantly offset by a decline in us aranesp sales 
product sales in the united states for the year ended december  totaled billion and were relatively unchanged from as the decline in aranesp sales  in particular in the supportive cancer care setting  was offset by the overall growth in our other products 
the decline in sales of aranesp reflects a decrease in demand resulting from various regulatory and reimbursement developments which principally occurred in the second half of  additional product label changes in and  to a lesser extent  loss of segment share as discussed below 
international product sales totaled billion  reflecting an increase of over international product sales comprised of total product sales in compared to in and consisted principally of european sales of aranesp and neulasta neupogen 
growth in international product sales for the year ended december  was principally driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes  which totaled million for the year  and sales of neulasta neupogen 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes for the year ended december   worldwide product sales increased and international product sales increased 
table of contents beginning in late and continuing into  foreign currency rates have also been experiencing extreme volatility 
changes in foreign currency rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales 
however  the benefit or detriment of any resulting increases or decreases that movements in foreign currency exchange rates have on our international product sales are largely offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and as a result of our related foreign currency hedging activities 
our hedging activities seek to offset the impact  both positive and negative  that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure  primarily with respect to the euro 
as discussed in more detail in item business key developments  certain of our products  principally our marketed esa products  have experienced a number of regulatory and reimbursement challenges  including safety related revisions to product labels and the loss of or significant restrictions on reimbursement 
the developments with respect to our marketed esa products have had a material adverse impact on aranesp sales  in particular  in the us supportive cancer care setting 
furthermore  our esa products will continue to face future challenges 
for example  in response to the fda s request  we have submitted a proposed rems for the class of esa products 
we believe that a rems program for our esa products could have a material adverse impact on the future sales of aranesp  especially in the us supportive cancer care setting 
additionally  future aranesp sales could also be materially adversely impacted by further changes in reimbursement  including as a result of future regulatory developments 
in addition  certain of our marketed products are also under increased competitive pressures  including from biosimilar and other products in europe  which compete or are expected to compete with aranesp  neulasta and neupogen  as well as our marketed products in the united states  including enbrel 
in addition  capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption  particularly during the latter part of and the beginning of we are working to manage our business effectively despite the unprecedented conditions in the financial markets both in the united states and around the world 
to date  these macro economic challenges have not affected us to a large degree 
the extent and or the duration of any potential adverse economic impact that such financial disruption may have on our third party payors  including governments and private insurance plans  wholesale distributors  customers  service providers and suppliers is unclear 
however  it may result in reduced demand for our products 
see item a 
risk factors the volatility of the current financial markets and the general economic slowdown may magnify certain risks that affect our business 
as a result of the challenges facing certain of our products and  in particular  the regulatory and reimbursement developments involving our marketed esa products that began in and their resulting impact on our operations  on august   we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant r d investments and build the framework for our future growth 
key components of our restructuring plan initially included i worldwide staff reductions aggregating approximately  positions  ii rationalization of our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities in order to gain cost efficiencies while continuing to meet future commercial and clinical demand for our products and product candidates and  to a lesser degree  changes to certain r d capital projects and iii abandoning leases primarily for certain r d facilities that will not be used in our operations 
through december   we have completed substantially all of the actions initially included in our restructuring plan  including the divestiture of certain less significant marketed products discussed below 
during  we identified certain additional initiatives designed to further assist in improving our cost structure  including outsourcing certain non core business functions  most notably certain of our information systems infrastructure services  as well as abandoning leases for certain additional facilities that will no longer be used in our operations 
the estimated cost of these additional initiatives is million to million 
as a result of these additional initiatives and certain minor changes in the expected costs for the actions initially included in our restructuring plan  the total charges currently expected to be incurred in connection with our restructuring plan  including related implementation costs  has been increased to million to million  as compared to our prior estimate of million to million as of december  through december  we have incurred million of these costs and estimate that all remaining amounts will be incurred through such cost estimates and amounts incurred are net of amounts recovered from our enbrel co promotion partner  wyeth 

table of contents in september  we entered into an agreement with biovitrum whereby they acquired from us the marketed biologic therapeutic products kepivance palifermin and stemgen ancestim  and also obtained from us a worldwide exclusive license to kineret anakinra for its current approved indication 
in connection with the disposal of these less significant marketed products  we incurred a million loss 
for the year ended december   worldwide product sales for these marketed products were approximately million 
there are many factors that affect us and our industry in general  including  among others  those relating to increased complexity and cost of r d due  in part  to greater scrutiny of clinical trials with respect to safety which may lead to fewer treatments being approved by the fda or other regulatory bodies and or safety related label changes for approved products  increasingly intense competition for marketed products and product candidates  reimbursement changes  healthcare provider prescribing behavior  regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices  complex and expanding regulatory requirements  and intellectual property protection

see item business marketed products and selected product candidates for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications 
total product sales for the year ended december  increased 
this increase reflects growth primarily in enbrel and neulasta neupogen sales significantly offset by a decline in us aranesp sales 
product sales in the united states for the year ended december  totaled billion and were relatively unchanged from as the decline in aranesp sales was offset by the overall growth in other products

table of contents aranesp for the years ended december   and  total aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows dollar amounts in millions change change aranesp us aranesp international total aranesp the decrease in us aranesp sales for the year ended december  reflects the negative impact on demand  primarily in the supportive cancer care setting  of physician conformance to regulatory and reimbursement developments which principally occurred in the second half of  additional product label changes which occurred in  and to a lesser extent  loss of segment share 
the decline in demand was partially offset by an increase in the average net sales price 
in addition  us sales of aranesp for the year ended december  benefited from a slight change in an accounting estimate related to product sales return reserves 
the regulatory and reimbursement developments negatively impacting sales  discussed in more detail in item business key developments  include i the loss of aranesp for use in the treatment of aoc in ii the march   november   march  and august  product safety related label changes in the united states  and iii the cms decision memorandum issued in july  which significantly restricted medicare reimbursement for use of aranesp in cia and which we believe has also negatively impacted aranesp use in cia for patients covered by private insurance plans 
the increase in international aranesp sales for the year ended december  is due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which positively impacted sales growth by approximately million 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes  international aranesp sales decreased 
this decrease reflects dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and pricing pressures across all esas in europe  which has resulted in an overall decrease in the esa market 
through december   biosimilars and other recently introduced marketed products in europe have not had a significant impact on total international aranesp segment share 
the decrease in us aranesp sales for the year ended december  was principally driven by a decline in demand 
this decline primarily reflects physician conformance to label and reimbursement changes that occurred throughout  primarily in the supportive cancer care setting  which are discussed in more detail in item business key developments  and  to a lesser extent  loss of segment share 
the increase in international aranesp sales for the year ended december  was primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes of million 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes  international aranesp sales increased 
international sales were negatively impacted in europe by dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and pricing pressures across all esas 
in addition to the factors mentioned in the product sales section above  future worldwide aranesp sales will be dependent  in part  on such factors as regulatory developments  including those resulting from the proposed rems for the class of esas  which we have submitted to the fda  or other risk management activities undertaken by us or required by the fda or other regulatory authorities  product labeling changes occurring in october in europe for the class of esas  including aranesp  by the european commission and the potential for further changes  future product label changes  reimbursement developments  including those resulting from government s and or third party payor s reaction to regulatory developments  including the proposed rems  which we have submitted to the fda  and recent or future product label changes

epogen for the years ended december   and  total epogen sales were as follows dollar amounts in millions change change epogen us the decrease in epogen sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in demand  reflecting a decline in the average net sales price 
the increase in demand resulting from patient population growth was offset by a decline in dose utilization in certain settings 
the decline in dose utilization is related to the esa label changes and the cms revision to its emp  which became effective january   as discussed in more detail in item business key developments 
we believe that the emp implementation significantly impacted physician behavior resulting in declines in dosing trends  as particularly noted in the quarter of implementation 
however  this dose decline subsequently moderated throughout the decline in epogen sales for the year ended december  reflects a decrease in demand due to a decline in dose utilization  partially offset by patient population growth 
the decline in dose utilization was due to physician behavior in making treatment and dosing decisions in response to regulatory and reimbursement developments that occurred throughout  including anticipation of the implementation of the cms revision to its emp  as discussed in more detail in item business key developments 
the decline in sales for the year ended december  was partially offset by favorable changes in wholesaler inventory and spillover 
spillover is a result of the company s contractual relationship with j j see note  summary of significant accounting policies product sales to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition to the factors mentioned in the product sales section above  future epogen sales will be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement developments  including those resulting from changes in healthcare providers prescribing behavior resulting in dose fluctuations due to the cms revisions to its emp  which became effective january

the increase in international neulasta neupogen sales for the year ended december  reflects increased demand driven by continued conversion from neupogen to neulasta as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which positively impacted the growth in combined international sales by million 
excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes  international neulasta neupogen sales increased versus the prior year

previously  enbrel was shipped directly to pharmacies 
however  beginning in the three months ended march   we commenced using a wholesaler distributor model  similar to our other marketed products 
also  enbrel sales growth for the year ended december  was affected by share declines in the rheumatology and dermatology segments in the united states compared to the prior year due to increased competitive activity 
however  sales growth continued in both rheumatology and dermatology  and enbrel continues to maintain a leading position in both segments 
enbrel sales growth for the year ended december  was driven by demand due to increases in both patients and average net sales price

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets relates to products technology rights acquired in connection with the immunex acquisition 
for the years ended december  and  amortization expense also included million and million  respectively  related to the impairment of a non enbrel related intangible asset previously acquired in the immunex acquisition 
write off of acquired in process research and development for acquisitions prior to january   the fair value of acquired ipr d projects  which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition  were immediately expensed see recent accounting pronouncements below 
in  we wrote off million and million of acquired ipr d related to the acquisitions of alantos and ilypsa  respectively 
the alantos ipr d amount is related to an orally administered treatment for type ii diabetes that  at the date of acquisition  was in phase a clinical trials 
the ilypsa ipr d amount is related to a phosphate binder that  at the date of acquisition  was in phase clinical trials for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ckd patients on hemodialysis 
in  we wrote off billion and million of acquired ipr d related to the acquisitions of abgenix and avidia  respectively 
the abgenix ipr d amount is primarily comprised of approximately million related to the rights which we did not own pursuant to our agreement with abgenix to jointly develop and commercialize panitumumab and approximately million related to a royalty that we would have owed to abgenix with respect to future sales of denosumab as a result of using certain of abgenix s patented technologies in the development of this product candidate 
panitumumab was abgenix s fully human monoclonal antibody which  at acquisition  was in phase clinical trials for the treatment of certain types of cancer 
denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is a key mediator of osteoclast formation  function and survival and was in phase clinical trials for various types of bone diseases at the time of the abgenix acquisition 
there were no individually significant ipr d projects acquired and written off in the acquisition of avidia 

table of contents we used the income method to determine the estimated fair values of acquired ipr d  which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs 
these success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates 
these cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted at success rates of for the alantos product candidate  for the ilypsa product candidate  and to for the abgenix product candidates 
the incremental r d expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approval for the alantos and ilypsa product candidates are immaterial 
the incremental r d expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the various indications of panitumumab were estimated at the time of acquisition at approximately million and would be incurred through the elimination of the royalty on potential future sales of denosumab did not result in us incurring any incremental r d expenses 
the above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize  as estimated 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization of these product candidates are our ability to confirm their safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials  our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs 
we are not able to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals  and such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective 
consequently  the eventual realized value of the acquired ipr d may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition 
at the date of acquisition  we intended to develop panitumumab for treatment of various types of cancer 
panitumumab received fda approval in late september for the treatment of mcrc after disease progression on  or following  fluoropyrimidine  oxaliplatin and irinotecan containing chemotherapy regimens and is marketed under the trademark vectibix 
in december  the european commission granted a conditional marketing authorization for vectibix as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with egfr expressing mcrc with non mutated wild type kras genes after failure of standard chemotherapy regimens 
this conditional approval is reviewed annually by the chmp  and in december we agreed as a condition of the renewal of approval to conduct an additional clinical trial in the existing approved indication 
we are continuing to develop or are evaluating plans to develop vectibix in all of the remaining indications we had intended at the date of acquisition 
however  since the acquisition  there have been several events that have affected the development plans for vectibix  such as the results of our pacce trial and kras biomarker analysis 
because of these developments  our expected time to obtain regulatory approvals for the remaining indications has been delayed compared to our original expectations 
our development efforts with respect to denosumab are continuing 
in december  we submitted a bla to the fda for denosumab for the treatment and prevention of pmo in women and bone loss in patients undergoing hormone ablation for either prostate or breast cancer 
on february   the fda accepted our bla and informed us that it will target an fda action within ten months of the bla s submission date 
additionally  in january  we submitted an application to the emea for the approval of denosumab for treatment of pmo in women and treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation therapy in patients with breast and prostate cancer 
in addition  we are continuing to develop the product candidate acquired in the alantos acquisition 
we have reviewed data from recently completed phase and clinical trials for amg  the product candidate acquired in the ilypsa acquisition 
the results were consistent with what is likely required for registration of a phosphate binding therapy 
however  in the context of our overall development portfolio  the company will be reviewing other options for the commercialization of this investigational product 
other charges as discussed in note  restructuring to the consolidated financial statements  on august   we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing 
table of contents to make significant r d investments and build the framework for our future growth 
as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded in other charges in and expenses for staff separation costs of million and million  respectively  asset impairments of million and million  respectively  and charges of million and million  respectively  primarily related to the loss accruals for leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our business 
also  in  the company recorded in other charges loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating million  principally related to the settlement of the ortho biotech antitrust suit 
in addition  in  the company recorded a million loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding 
income taxes our effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for remained relatively unchanged from although the effective tax rate benefited from the favorable resolution of certain income tax examinations  this benefit was substantially offset by the write off of nondeductible acquired ipr d costs  resulting in a comparable effective tax rate between the two years 
our effective tax rate for decreased over primarily due to the lesser amount of the write off of nondeductible acquired ipr d costs in than in and the greater tax benefit from the favorable resolutions of our prior years income tax examinations in than in as permitted in accounting principles board opinion apb no

we will adopt fsp apb  effective january   and retrospectively apply this change in accounting to all prior periods presented for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt  as required by this new standard 
under this new method of accounting  the debt and equity components of our convertible debt securities will be bifurcated and accounted for separately in a manner that will result in recognizing interest expense on these securities at effective rates reflective of what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms 
the equity component of our convertible debt securities will be included in stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets and  accordingly  the initial carrying values of these debt securities will be reduced 
our net income for financial reporting purposes will be reduced by recognizing the accretion of the reduced carrying values of our convertible debt securities to their face amounts as additional non cash interest expense 
the adoption of fsp apb will result in a reduction in the carrying value of our convertible debt by approximately million as of december  and will increase interest expense  net by approximately million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
additionally  the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon terms or amounts for some obligations 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations the long term debt obligation amounts include future interest payments

table of contents notes at a fixed rate of and the century notes at a fixed rate of 
to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
these interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a libor based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note 
we used an interest rate forward curve at december  to compute the net amounts to be included in the table above for future interest payments on our variable rate interest rate swaps 
purchase obligations primarily relate to i our long term supply agreement with bi pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of enbrel  which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for enbrel and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved  ii r d commitments including those related to clinical trials for new and existing products  iii capital expenditures  iv open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business and v our agreement with international business machines corporation ibm  which we entered into on october   for certain information systems infrastructure services 
the term of the agreement is five years with three one year renewals  at our option  for a total of up to eight years 
the cost to us for the initial five year term  included in the table above  is estimated to be million 
the estimated aggregate additional cost of the three one year renewal options not included in the table above is approximately million 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events 
in addition to the current liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits utbs included in the table above  long term liabilities for utbs net of federal tax benefits on state taxes and related accrued interest totaling approximately million at december  are not included in the table above because  due to their nature  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities 
on february   we entered into an agreement for certain integrated facilities management services 
the contract has an initial term of five years and automatically renews annually thereafter at the company s option 
the cost to the company for the initial five year term is estimated to be approximately million 
the contractual obligations under this contract are not included in the table above given the timing of entering into the agreement 
in addition to the above table  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of in licensing and product development programs all of which are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events 
such events could include  but are not limited to  development milestones  regulatory approvals and product sales 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been included in the table above or recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
individually  these arrangements are not material in any one reporting period 
however  if the achievement of the milestones covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period  the resulting payment obligation would be approximately billion 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and therefore  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product sales  sales incentives and returns sales of our products are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed 
product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates  wholesaler chargebacks  discounts and other incentives collectively sales incentives and returns 

table of contents in the united states  we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers  such as physicians or their clinics  dialysis centers  hospitals and pharmacies 
products we sell outside the united states are principally distributed to hospitals and or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched 
we monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third party data and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels generally two to three weeks given end user demand 
accordingly  historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns 
accruals for sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales 
sales incentive accruals are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns 
sales incentives are product specific and  therefore  for any given year  can be impacted by the mix of products sold 
for the years ended december   and  reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives were comprised of the following dollar amounts in millions rebates wholesaler chargebacks discounts and other incentives total sales incentives percent of gross product sales rebates earned by healthcare providers  such as physicians or their clinics  dialysis centers and hospitals in the united states may include performance based offers  such as attaining contractually specified segment share or other performance based measures 
as a result  the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate s to be earned over a contractual period 
these rebates totaled billion in  billion in and billion in we believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
based on our recent experience  changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods 
these changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period 
a change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in would have had an impact of approximately million on our product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity 
wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in sales incentives that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the united states at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers 
when the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices  the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers 
these chargebacks from wholesalers totaled billion for each of the three years ended december  accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability 

table of contents amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate 
accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results 
however  such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position 
the following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives in millions balance at beginning of period amounts charged against product sales payments balance at end of period year ended december  december  includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates 
such amounts represented less than of incentive amounts charged against product sales for and accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales 
returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product  when appropriate 
historically  sales return provisions have been insignificant  amounting to less than of gross product sales 
furthermore  changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant 
deferred income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states based on our projected cash flow  working capital and long term investment requirements of our us and foreign operations 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable us and state marginal income tax rates which could materially impact our future effective tax rate 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes  contractual disputes  governmental investigations and class action suits 
certain of these proceedings are discussed in note  contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies 
in addition  our income tax returns are routinely audited by the internal revenue service irs and various state and foreign tax authorities 
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items  one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
valuation of acquired intangible assets we have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily by acquiring biotechnology companies 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations 
discounted cash flow 
table of contents models are typically used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
fair value measurement of financial instruments the company adopted the provisions of the fasb s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  effective january   for its financial assets and liabilities 
under this standard  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities  the company uses various valuation approaches 
sfas establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the availability of observable inputs can vary among the various types of financial assets and liabilities 
to the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
whenever the estimated fair value of any of our available for sale securities is less than their related cost  we perform an impairment analysis in accordance with the fasb s sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the fasb and the sec  in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income for the applicable accounting period 
however  an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of income and reduces net income for the applicable accounting period 
the primary factors we consider to differentiate our impairments between temporary and other than temporary impairments include the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
as of december   the company s available for sale securities were comprised of us treasury securities  obligations of us government agencies  fdic guaranteed bank debt  corporate debt securities  mortgage and asset backed securities  other short term interest bearing securities  including money market funds  and publicly traded equity investments 
us treasury securities  money market funds and publicly traded equity investments are valued using quoted market prices with no valuation adjustments applied 
obligations of us government agencies  fdic guaranteed bank debt  corporate debt securities  mortgage and asset backed securities and other short term interest bearing securities are valued using quoted market prices of recent transactions or are benchmarked to transactions of very similar securities 

table of contents our derivatives assets and liabilities include interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward and option contracts 
the fair values of these derivatives are determined using models based on market observable inputs  including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies 
we believe that the values assigned to our available for sale securities and derivative instruments as of december  and are fairly stated in accordance with gaap and are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions 
in addition  we believe that the cost basis for our available for sale securities as of december  and was recoverable in all material respects 
in  the us economy continued to be adversely affected by tightening in the credit markets and volatility in capital markets 
interest rates on us treasury instruments declined considerably during this crisis while other interest rates fluctuated in excess of historical norms 
in addition  the us dollar strengthened dramatically over the second half of the year against most other currencies during a period of extremely high levels of currency volatility 
continuing distress in the economic environment could ultimately result in other than temporary impairments of the carrying values of our available for sale securities and or a material adverse impact on the carrying values of our financial instruments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a global biotechnology company with operations in various countries 
we are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business 
to reduce certain of these risks  we monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits  requiring letters of credit and obtaining credit insurance  as we deem appropriate 
in addition  we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments  primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer 
we also enter into various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program 
we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives 
in  the us economy continued to be adversely affected by a tightening in the credit markets and volatility in the capital markets 
in an attempt to increase liquidity and stabilize the global financial markets  the us federal government acted in concert with other foreign governments through various forms of direct market intervention 
short term interest rates on us treasury instruments have declined considerably during this crisis while other short term rates have fluctuated in excess of historical norms 
as a result  in the discussion that follows  we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of basis points or  as applicable  from those at december  as this crisis deepened  it spread to the economies of many countries worldwide 
this resulted in increased demand for the us dollar due to the financial market s perception of its relatively higher quality and liquidity 
consequently  the us dollar strengthened dramatically over the second half of the year against most other currencies but also experienced unprecedented levels of volatility 
our analysis which follows assumes a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of december  interest rate sensitive financial instruments our investment portfolio of available for sale securities at december  and was comprised primarily of us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies  money market funds whose underlying securities were us treasury and agency obligations  corporate debt instruments  commercial paper and mortgage backed securities that are guaranteed by us government agencies 
the fair value of our investment portfolio was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a basis point change in interest rates 
applying a duration model  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates at december  and december  would not have a material effect on the fair values of these securities 
in addition a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and december  would not have a material effect on the income or cash flows 

table of contents on december   we had outstanding debt with a carrying value and a fair value of billion  including billion of convertible debt with a fair value of billion 
our outstanding debt at december  was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates 
on december   we had billion of outstanding debt with a fair value of billion  including billion of convertible debt with a fair value of billion 
our outstanding debt at december  was comprised of billion of debt with fixed interest rates and billion of debt with variable interest rates 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on our fixed rate debt but would impact our variable rate debt outstanding at december  a hypothetical increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at december  would not have a material impact on income or cash flows with respect to our billion of variable rate debt that was outstanding at december  changes in interest rates would  however  affect the fair values of all of the outstanding debt at december  and  including  to a lesser extent  our variable rate debt outstanding at december  for which the interest rate reset quarterly 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at december  would result in an increase of approximately million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at december  would result in an increase of approximately million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt 
to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt  we enter into interest rate swap agreements  which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges  for certain of our fixed rate debt with carrying values totaling billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
these derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a libor based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at december  and would not have a material effect on the fair value  cash flows or income of our interest rate swap agreements 
market price sensitive instruments as noted above  a portion of our outstanding debt may be converted into our common stock in certain circumstances 
accordingly  the price of our common stock may affect the fair value of our convertible debt 
a hypothetical increase in the price of amgen stock from the price at december  would have increased the fair value of our then outstanding convertible debt by approximately million 
a hypothetical increase in the price of amgen stock from the price at december  would have increased the fair value of our then outstanding convertible debt by approximately million 
on december  and  we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments  which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio on december  and was not material 
foreign currency sensitive instruments our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately the euro  as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets 
increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses 
to further reduce our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations  we have entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts 
on december   we had outstanding forward and options contracts  primarily euro based  with notional amounts of billion and million  respectively 
on december   we had outstanding forward and options contracts  primarily euro based  with notional amounts of billion and million  respectively 
these contracts are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of december  the net unrealized gains and as of december  
table of contents the net unrealized losses on these contracts were not material 
with regard to these contracts  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates on december  would result in a reduction in fair value of approximately million  a reduction in income of million in the ensuing year and no material impact on cash flows 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates on december  would result in a reduction in fair value of approximately million and no material reductions in income or cash flows 
also on december  and  we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million  respectively  that hedge fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
these contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of december  and with regard to these contracts  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates on december  would not have a material impact on fair value  income or cash flows 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates on would not have a material impact on fair value  income or cash flows 
the analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions and assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset 
counterparty credit risks our financial instruments  including derivatives  are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement 
we attempt to mitigate this risk through credit monitoring procedures
