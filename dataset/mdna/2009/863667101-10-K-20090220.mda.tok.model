 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related interpretations 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and  million in current marketable securities at december  the company had outstanding borrowings totaling million at that date  all of which were classified as current obligations

in order to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other than temporary impairment 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities are recorded in earnings 
the primary factors considered by the company to recognize declines in the fair value of its investments as other than temporary impairments are the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer based on publicly available financial information 
beginning in february  liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of the auction rate securities ars investments held by the company  as the amount of securities submitted for sale in those auctions exceeded the amount of purchase bids 
to date the company has collected all interest receivable on outstanding ars when due and expects to continue to do so in the future 
due to current market conditions the ars investments have continued to experience failed auctions 
these failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities 
the company does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity in its ars  even for an extended period of time  will affect its ability to finance its operations  including its expansion programs and planned capital expenditures 
the company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments 
these investments will be classified as non current assets until liquidity is restored in the market 
as of december   the company held million  at par value  of ars investments 
in the company entered into an ars rights agreement rights with ubs financial services inc ubs  one of its investment providers  whereby the company received the right to sell its ars at par value to ubs at any time during the period june  through july  these rights are nontransferable securities registered with the us securities and exchange commission 
as a result of accepting the rights  the company has released ubs and its employees agents from all claims except claims for consequential damages directly or indirectly relating to ubs s marketing and sale of ars and agreed not to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any class action settlement or investor fund 
the company elected to measure the value of the rights under the fair value option of fasb statement no 
 and recorded a gain of million in other income expense  and a corresponding non current asset 
simultaneously  the company transferred its ars investments  at their fair value of million  from available for sale to trading marketable securities 
as a result of this transfer  the company recognized a loss of million in other income expense  reflecting a reversal of the related temporary valuation allowance that was previously recorded within accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in shareholders equity 
the company anticipates that any future changes in the fair value of the rights will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related ars  both of which will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on an ongoing basis 
the company s future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than year  including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business  are summarized as follows in millions payment period after total long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations contribution to defined benefits plans other as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december   the company s defined benefit pension plans are in an underfunded status of million 
due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance  changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods  beyond  in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december   the company has recorded a liability for unresolved income tax positions of million 
due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these unresolved income tax positions will be made 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on historical experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that  of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause some of the company s products to become obsolete 
the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
income taxes the company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues  including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product royalty arrangements  may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates 
because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant  the company records accruals representing management s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome 
other matters the company distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the us dollar  european currencies  in particular the euro and the british pound  the japanese yen  the australian dollar and the canadian dollar 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  france  germany  ireland  switzerland  canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies 
this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the company s cost of sales 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies 
all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period  with resulting gains losses included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging from to days 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging from to days 
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points 
a hypothetical change in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would change the december  fair value by approximately million 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties
