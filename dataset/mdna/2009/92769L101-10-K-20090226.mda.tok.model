reverse acquisition of telewest on march   ntl merged with a subsidiary of telewest and the merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of telewest using the purchase method 
in connection with this transaction  telewest changed its name to ntl incorporated  and has since changed its name to virgin media inc the total purchase price was billion  including cash of billion  common stock valued at billion  stock options with a fair value of million and direct transaction costs of million 
factors affecting our business a number of factors affect the performance of our business  at both a general and segment level 

table of contents general factors that affect all of the segments that we operate in are as follows  general macroeconomic factors 
general macroeconomic factors in the uk have an impact on certain areas of our business 
for example  consumers and businesses may be less willing or able to purchase our products  upgrade their existing services in our cable segment or  in particular  purchase retail products sold by sit up in our content segment 
we may also experience increased churn and higher bad debt expense 
in addition  as expenditures by advertisers are sensitive to economic conditions and tend to decline in recessionary periods and other periods of uncertainty  a slowing economy is likely to be accompanied by a decrease in advertising revenues generated through our television programming and broadband internet platforms except to the extent offset by an increase in our share of the advertising market 
in our mobile segment  customers may also reduce their expenditures on mobile phones and usage 
currency movements 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenue and operating costs are earned and paid primarily in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
we have in place hedging programs that seek to mitigate the risk from these exposures 
while the objective of this program is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying currency exchange rates  not all of our exposures are hedged  and not all of our hedges are designated as such for accounting purposes 
additionally  we do not hedge the principal portion of our convertible senior notes 
we also purchase goods and services in us dollars and euros  such as goods for resale  tv programming  customer premise equipment and network maintenance services  and some of these exposures are not hedged 
integration and restructuring activities 
in the fourth quarter of we commenced the implementation of a new restructuring plan  and continued to integrate certain of the operations of virgin mobile 
the restructuring plan is aimed at driving further improvements in our operational performance and eliminating inefficiencies in order to create a fully integrated  customer focused organization 
while we anticipate significant cost savings from the plan and that the annual savings from and after will exceed the annual costs  we expect that costs will exceed savings 
these costs will include employee termination costs  lease and contract exit costs  purchases of fixed assets and other related expenses  some of which will be classified as restructuring costs under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or fas in total  we expect to incur operating expenditures of between million to million and capital expenditures of between million to million over a three year period 
our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to implement our restructuring plan successfully and realize the anticipated benefits 
cable segment in our cable segment  residential customers account for the majority of our total revenue 
the number of residential customers  the number and types of services that each customer uses and the prices we charge for these services drive our revenue 
our profit is driven by the relative margins on the types of services we provide to these customers and by the number of services that we provide to them 
for example  broadband internet is more profitable than our television services and  on average  our triple play customers are more profitable than double play or single play customers 
our packaging of services and our pricing are designed to encourage our customers to use multiple services such as television  telephone and broadband at a lower price than each stand alone product on a combined basis 
factors particularly affecting our cable segment include customer churn  average revenue per user  or arpu  competition  capital expenditures and seasonality 

table of contents customer churn 
customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing to our services 
an increase in our customer churn can lead to increased costs and reduced revenue 
we continue to focus on improving our customer service and enhancing and expanding our service offerings to existing customers in order to manage our customer churn rate 
our ability to reduce our customer churn rate beyond a base level is limited by factors like competition  the economy and customers moving outside our network service area  in particular during the summer season 
managing our customer churn rate is a significant component of our business plan 
our customer churn rate may increase if our customer service is seen as unsatisfactory  if we are unable to deliver our services over our network without interruption  if we fail to match offerings by our competitors  if we increase our prices  if there is an improvement in the uk housing market or if there is a prolonged economic downturn 
cable arpu 
cable arpu is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing revenue from our residential cable customers on our network 
we believe that our triple play cable offering of television  broadband and fixed line telephone services is attractive to our existing customer base and generally allows us to increase our cable arpu by facilitating the sale of multiple services to each customer 
cable arpu excludes any revenue from our mobile segment 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant and increasing competition in the market for our consumer services  including broadband and telephone services offered by bt group plc  or bt  and resellers or local loop unbundlers  such as british sky broadcasting group plc  or bskyb  and carphone warehouse talk talk  alternative internet access services like dsl  satellite television services offered by bskyb and by bbc and itv through freesat  digital terrestrial television offered through freeview  internet protocol television offered by tiscali spa and bt  and mobile telephone  television and data services offered by other mobile telephone operators 
our business services also face a range of competitors  including bt and cable wireless plc 
certain competitors  such as bt and bskyb  are dominant in markets in which we compete and may use their dominance in those markets to offer bundled services that compete with our product offerings 
as a result of increased competition  we have had to  and may be required to continue to  adjust our pricing  improve our product offering and offer discounts to new and existing customers in order to attract and retain customers 
capital expenditures 
our business requires substantial capital expenditures on a continuing basis for various purposes  including expanding  maintaining and upgrading our network  investing in new customer acquisitions  and offering new services 
if we do not continue to invest in our network and in new technologies  our ability to retain and acquire customers may be hindered 
therefore  our liquidity and the availability of cash to fund capital projects are important drivers of our revenue 
when our liquidity is restricted  so is our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
seasonality 
some revenue streams are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  telephone usage revenue by residential customers and businesses tends to be slightly lower during summer holiday months 
our customer churn rates include persons who disconnect their service because of moves  resulting in a seasonal increase in our churn rates during the summer months when higher levels of uk house moves have traditionally occured and students leave their accommodation between academic years 
mobile segment factors particularly affecting our mobile segment include competition  mobile arpu  seasonality and our third party distribution arrangements 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant competition in our markets from mobile operators  including 
table of contents o  vodafone  orange  t mobile and uk  and from other mobile virtual network operators  including tesco mobile and carphone warehouse 
many of our competitors are part of large multinational organizations  have substantial advertising and marketing budgets  and have a significant retail presence 
if competitive forces prevent us from charging the prices for these services that we plan to charge  or if our competition is able to attract our customers or potential customers we are targeting  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
mobile arpu 
mobile arpu is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing revenue from our mobile customers 
the mix of prepay and contract customers and level of usage have a material impact on mobile arpu 
the mix of our customer base is changing as we focus on acquiring higher lifetime value contract customers  particularly through cross selling to our cable segment customer base  rather than lower lifetime value prepay customers 
consequently  the number of prepay customers is expected to decline in  along with prepay usage 
seasonality 
some revenue streams and cost drivers are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  in the fourth quarter of each year our customer acquisition and retention costs typically increase due to the christmas holiday period 
our mobile arpu generally decreases in the first quarter of each year due to the fewer number of days in february and lower usage after the christmas holiday period 
distribution 
we primarily rely upon third parties to distribute our mobile products and services 
if any of these distribution partners were to cease to act as distributors for our products and services  or the commissions or other costs charged by the third parties were to increase  our ability to gain new customers or retain existing customers may be adversely affected 
we also distribute our products through our own retail outlets 
content segment factors particularly affecting our content segment include competition  the number of buyers for our television channels across limited distribution platforms  our access to content  seasonality and advertising revenue 
competition 
our television channels compete with other broadcasters for advertising revenues  subscription revenues  and programming rights 
our retail channels operated through sit up compete with a large variety of retailers in the uk market and with other television channels for audiences 
ids  our advertising sales department  competes with advertising sales operations representing other television broadcasters 
limited number of buyers and distribution platforms 
all of our channels are carried on our cable platform and on the satellite platform owned by bskyb 
a few of our channels are also carried on the free to air digital terrestrial television platform known as freeview 
therefore  the principal third party buyer of our television channels is bskyb 
other than bskyb  there are no significant buyers of our television channels 
access to content 
most of the television content on the virgin media tv channels is purchased  mainly from the us  and because there is a limited supply of content available and an increasing number of digital channels in the uk  virgin media tv has experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of its imported programming 
exchange rate movements have also resulted in increased programming costs and may continue to do so 
seasonality 
our content segment incurs increased costs in the fourth quarter of each year due to the need to provide enhanced programming over the important christmas holiday period 
also  sit up generally records increased revenues and costs in the fourth quarter due to higher retail sales in the lead up to the christmas holiday 

table of contents advertising revenue 
the majority of revenue for virgin media tv is from advertisers 
consequently  virgin media tv s revenue is directly affected by changes in the total spend on television advertising in the uk  the viewing levels for its channels and the proportion of the uk advertising market represented by ids 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported  as well as disclosures about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the following critical accounting policies have the potential to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
an impact could occur because of the significance of the financial statement item to which these policies relate  or because these policies require more judgment and estimation than other matters owing to the uncertainty related to measuring  at a specific point in time  transactions that are continuous in nature 
these policies may need to be revised in the future in the event that changes to our business occur 
impairment of long lived assets and indefinite lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives to be held and used by an entity are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
 impairment of long lived assets  or fas indications of impairment are determined by reviewing undiscounted projected future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill arising from business combinations  reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and intangible assets with indefinite lives  are subject to annual review for impairment or more frequently should indications of impairment arise 
impairment of goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets is determined using a two step approach  initially based on a comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value  if the fair value is lower than the carrying value  then the second step compares the asset s fair value implied fair value for goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets with its carrying value to measure the amount of the impairment 
impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives is determined based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value 
any excess of carrying value over fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 
we evaluate our cable reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as at december  while our mobile  virgin media tv and sit up reporting units are evaluated as at june we incurred impairment charges in in respect of our mobile and sit up reporting units  and we may incur further impairment charges under fasb statement no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  or fas  if market values decline and we do not achieve expected cash flows 
while we utilize a variety of valuation techniques to determine fair value  including market multiples and comparable transactions  estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows 
all of these techniques are reliant on our long range cash flow forecasts 
in estimating cash flows  we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected customer numbers  projected product sales mix and price changes  projected changes in prices we pay for purchases of fixed assets and services as well as projected labor costs 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows and those estimates 
table of contents include inherent uncertainties  including those relating to the timing and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation 
assumptions used in these cash flow projections are consistent with our internal forecasts 
if actual results differ from the assumptions used in the impairment review  we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
assumptions made about increased competition and a further slowdown in the economy on a longer term basis could impact the valuation to be used in future annual impairment testing 
the table below illustrates the hypothetical impairment loss related to our reporting units if the fair value of those reporting units had declined from the amount calculated at the time of our latest annual or interim impairment test by the following percentages in millions percentage decline in fair value and related hypothetical impairment cable mobile virgin media tv sit up hypothetical impairment represents the amount by which the carrying value would exceed the fair value of the reporting unit 
fixed assets labor and overhead costs directly related to the construction and installation of fixed assets  including payroll and related costs of some employees and related rent and other occupancy costs  are capitalized 
the payroll and related costs of some employees that are directly related to construction and installation activities are capitalized based on specific time devoted to these activities where identifiable 
in cases where the time devoted to these activities is not specifically identifiable  we capitalize costs based upon estimated allocations 
costs associated with initial customer installations are capitalized 
the costs of reconnecting the same service to a previously installed premise are charged to expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we assign fixed assets and intangible assets useful lives that impact the annual depreciation and amortization expense 
the assignment of useful lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
our management use their experience and expertise in applying judgments about appropriate estimates 
changes in technology or changes in intended use of these assets may cause the estimated useful life to change  resulting in higher or lower depreciation charges or asset impairment charges 
costs associated with construction and installation activities installation revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 financial reporting by cable television companies  in relation to connection and activation fees for cable television  as well as fixed line telephone and broadband internet services  on the basis that we market and maintain a unified fiber network through which we provide all of these services 
installation revenues are recognized at the time the installation has been completed to the extent that those fees are less than direct selling costs 
installation fees in excess of direct selling costs are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the customer s connection 
the nature and amount of labor and other costs to be capitalized with respect to construction and installation activities involves significant judgment 
in addition to direct external and internal labor and materials  we also capitalize other costs directly attributable to our construction and installation activities 
we continuously monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and update the policy when necessary to respond to changes in facts and circumstances  such as the development of 
table of contents new products and services  and changes in the manner that installations or construction activities are performed 
restructuring costs as of january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or fas  and recognize a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities when the liability is incurred 
the adoption of fas did not have a significant effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
prior to  we recognized a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities at the time a commitment to restructure was given  in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  or eitf liabilities for costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to january  continue to be accounted for under eitf in relation to our restructuring activities  we have recorded a liability of million as of december  relating to lease exit costs of properties that we have vacated 
in calculating the liability  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including the timing of ultimate disposal of the properties  our ability to sublet the properties either in part or as a whole  amounts of sublet rental income achievable including any incentives required to be given in subleases  amounts of lease termination costs  and discount rates 
income taxes our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  income tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
from time to time  we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to some uncertainty 
examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals  issues related to consideration paid or received in connection with acquisitions  and certain financing transactions 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
at each period end  we make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including  but not limited to  the expected operating income or loss for the year  projections of the proportion of income or loss earned and taxed in the uk and the extent to which this income or loss may also be taxed in the us  permanent and temporary differences  the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions taken in respect to matters such as business acquisitions and disposals and certain financing transactions including intercompany transactions  amongst others  and we accrue a liability when we believe an assessment is more likely than not and the amount is estimable 
the impacts of revisions to these estimates are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes have and will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our tax environment changes 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

table of contents such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts and customer lists  the trademark s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio and discount rates 
management s assumptions about fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur  which may affect management s estimates 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in particular  liabilities in relation to tax exposures or liabilities to restructure the pre acquisition businesses of ntl  telewest and virgin mobile  including the exit of properties and termination of employees  are revised as estimates are updated 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  or fas fas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
fas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
fas is effective for certain financial instruments included in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and for all other non financial instruments for fiscal years beginning after november  the provisions of fas relating to certain financial instruments were adopted by us in the first quarter of effective january   and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or fas fas allows companies to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we did not elect to measure any of our financial assets or liabilities at fair value as a result of the implementation of fas in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  business combinations  or fas r 
fas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to prospectively recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
further  regardless of the business combination date  any subsequent changes to acquired uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances associated with acquired deferred tax assets will no longer be applied to goodwill but will be recognized as an adjustment to income tax expense 
fas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  while we are still addressing the impact of the adoption of fas r  it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or fas fas establishes requirements for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than ourselves sometimes called minority 
table of contents interests to be clearly identified  presented  and disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
all changes in the parent s ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any non controlling equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value 
fas is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december   however  presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements 
while we are still addressing the impact of the adoption of fas  it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or fas  which amends and expands the disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or fas  with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fas and its related interpretations  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
fas requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative instruments 
fas applies to all entities and all derivative instruments and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we have not yet adopted the provisions of fas  but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  or fas fas sets forth the level of authority to a given accounting pronouncement or document by category 
where there might be conflicting guidance between two categories  the more authoritative category will prevail 
fas will become effective days after the sec approves the pcaob s amendments to au section of the aicpa professional standards 
we do not expect fas to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements at this time 
consolidated results of operations consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   revenue decreased by to  million from  million for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to lower revenue in our cable segment  driven by declining telephony usage and increased discounting due to increased competition  and lower mobile segment revenue  mainly due to lower prepay revenue as a result of fewer customers 
this reduction was partially offset by an increase in revenue in our content segment 
see further discussion of our cable  mobile and content segments below 
expenses operating costs 
for the year ended december   operating costs  including network expenses  decreased slightly to  million from  million during the same period in this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased operating costs in our cable and mobile segments partially offset by increased operating costs in our content segment 
lower employee  facilities and other network costs in our cable segment and reduced commissions and equipment costs in our mobile segment were partially offset by increased interconnect costs in our mobile segment and increased programming costs in our content segment following the launch of our virgin channel in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million for the same period in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower employee costs primarily as a result of fewer employees  lower bad debt expense and a reduction in costs in relation to marketing and our rebrand to virgin media in the decrease was partially offset by increased professional charges 
restructuring and other charges for the year ended december   restructuring and other charges decreased to million from million for the same period in restructuring and other charges in the year ended december   related primarily to contract and lease exit costs in connection with the restructuring program initiated in the last quarter of as discussed below 
restructuring and other charges in the year ended december   related primarily to employee termination costs and lease exit costs in connection with our restructuring programs initiated in respect of the reverse acquisition of telewest 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced the implementation of a restructuring plan aimed at driving further improvements in our operational performance and eliminating inefficiencies in order to create a fully integrated  customer focused organization 
this plan will involve the incurrence of substantial operating and capital expenditures  including certain costs which we expect to treat as restructuring costs under fas the following table summarizes our historical restructuring accruals  the restructuring accruals resulting from the acquisitions made by us during and the restructuring plan announced in in millions historical restructuring accruals acquisition restructuring accruals restructuring accruals total lease exit costs involuntary employee termination and related costs lease exit costs involuntary employee termination and related costs lease and contract exit costs balance  december  charged to expense revisions utilized balance  december  depreciation expense for the year ended december   depreciation expense decreased to million from million for the same period in this decrease was primarily as a result of fixed assets becoming fully depreciated  partially offset by increases in depreciation in respect of new fixed assets  relating particularly to the upgrade and expansion of our networks  and changes in the useful economic lives of certain asset categories with effect from january  amortization expense for the year ended december   amortization expense decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease in amortization expense related primarily to the final amortization of certain intangible assets  partially offset by the reduction in the remaining useful economic lives of certain intangible assets with effect from january  
table of contents goodwill and intangible asset impairments we performed our annual impairment review for our mobile  virgin media tv and sit up reporting units as at june  as a result of this review we concluded that the fair values of the virgin media tv and sit up reporting units exceeded their carrying value  while the mobile reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying value 
as at december   we performed our annual impairment review of the goodwill recognized in our cable segment and concluded that its fair value exceeded its carrying value 
the fair value of the mobile reporting unit was determined through the use of a combination of both market and income valuation approaches to calculate fair value 
the market approach valuations in respect of the mobile reporting unit have declined from the prior year primarily as a result of declining market multiples of comparable companies 
the income approach valuations in respect of the mobile reporting unit declined as a result of a combination of an increased discount rate  a reduced terminal value multiple and reduced long term cash flow estimates 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in relation to this reporting unit in the year ended december  in september  our sit up reporting unit received notification that one of its two licenses to broadcast over freeview digital terrestrial television would not be renewed in january along with this  the downturn in the economy has had a negative impact on sit up s business 
management performed a review of the implications of these changes on sit up s business model and  as a result  an interim goodwill impairment review was performed 
this review resulted in an impairment charge being recognized of million in relation to intangible assets and million in relation to goodwill in the year ended december  interest income and other  net for the year ended december   interest income and other increased to million from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of higher interest income receivable on higher cash balances during the year  together with the non recurrence in of losses incurred in on disposal of fixed assets 
in  interest income and other included gains on disposal of investments of million  offset by losses on disposal of fixed assets of million 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense decreased to million from million for the same period in  mainly as a result of reductions in certain loan obligations following voluntary repayments under our senior credit facility in december and april  partially offset by interest on the new convertible senior notes issued in april which funded the repayment of higher cost bank debt 
we paid cash interest of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in cash interest payments resulted from changes in the timing of interest payments 
loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   loss on extinguishment of debt was million which related to the write off of deferred financing costs as a result of the prepayment of million under our senior credit facility during the year 
for the year ended december   loss on extinguishment of debt was million which related to the write off of deferred financing costs as a result of our partial repayments of million under our senior credit facility during the year 

table of contents share of income from equity investments for the year ended december   share of income from equity investments was million as compared with income of million for the same period in the share of income from equity investments in the years ended december  and was largely comprised of our proportionate share of the income earned by uktv  which was partially offset by the losses incurred by setanta sports news 
see segmental results of operations for the years ended december  and television channel joint ventures 
gain loss from derivative instruments the gain from derivative instruments of million in the year ended december   mainly related to unrealized gains from the recognition of favorable mark to market changes in us dollar and euro denominated cross currency interest rate swaps which are not designated as accounting hedges but do economically mitigate the risk of certain exposures denominated in us dollars and euros 
the loss from derivative instruments of million in the year ended december   primarily related to unrealized losses on cross currency interest rate swaps not designated as hedges offset by hedge ineffectiveness on certain interest rate swaps

in addition  in we took significant steps to increase alignment of the prices paid by our existing customers with the prices paid by new customers  the full year impact of which has been reflected in partially offsetting these decreases have been increases in revenue from selective telephony and television price increases as well as from additional subscribers to our television  broadband and fixed line telephone services 
cable arpu increased slightly to for the three months ended december  from for the three months ended december  the increase in cable arpu was due to selective price increases and successful up selling and cross selling to existing customers  partly offset by declining telephony usage and higher price discounting as discussed above 
our focus on acquiring new bundled customers and on cross selling to existing customers is shown by cable revenue generating units  or cable rgus  per customer increasing to at december  from at december  and by triple play penetration growing to at december  from at december  a triple play customer is a customer who subscribes to all three of our television  broadband and fixed line telephone services

retail telephony voice revenue decreased mainly as a 
table of contents result of declining telephony usage  as a result of which our strategy has been to replace this declining voice revenue with increasing data revenue 
retail data revenue represented of the retail business revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  other retail revenue in the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the majority of this revenue is from infrastructure projects which are non recurring in nature 
our largest infrastructure project has been the provision of telecoms network equipment for heathrow airport s new terminal which contributed million of revenue in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  this contract  however  operates at a lower margin and  consequently  it does not have a significant impact on cable segment ocf 
wholesale revenue decreased mainly as a result of fewer customers in a highly competitive market partly offset by million of stronger than usual customer equipment sales in the last three months of the year 
cable segment ocf for the year ended december   cable segment ocf increased to  million from  million for the year ended december  this increase is partly due to lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of a reduction in marketing costs after our rebrand to virgin media in together with lower employee related costs  and lower direct operating costs as a result of lower revenues 
partially offsetting these savings were lower consumer revenue  primarily as a result of higher price discounting and lower telephony usage  together with the decline in revenue from business customers  as described above

for the year ended december   the principal components of cash provided by financing activities were the new billion senior credit facility and the million senior notes due  and the principal uses of cash were the repayment of our previous senior credit and bridge facilities utilizing the new borrowings and cash provided by operations 
see further discussion under liquidity and capital resources senior credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million of debt outstanding  compared to  million as of september  and  million as of december   and million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of september  and million as of december  the increase in debt since the previous year is primarily attributable to a million unfavorable exchange rate movement on our debt denominated in currencies other than the pound sterling together with a greater use of finance leases 
this was partially offset by a million voluntary prepayment of our senior credit facility in december from existing cash balances 
our business is capital intensive and we are highly leveraged 
we have significant cash requirements for operating costs  capital expenditures and interest expense 
we also have significant principal payments under our senior credit facility due in  as described below 
the level of our capital expenditures and operating expenditures are affected by the significant amounts of capital required to connect customers to our network  expand and upgrade our network and offer new services 
we expect that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations and amounts undrawn on our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient for our cash requirements through december  however  our cash requirements after december  may exceed these sources of cash 
significant principal payments under our senior credit facility are due in and however  in november  we amended the terms of our senior credit facility to defer a significant portion of these payments to the deferral is conditional on us prepaying a further million under our senior credit facility prior to august we believe that we should be able to meet this prepayment condition using cash flow from operations and  if required  from amounts undrawn on our revolving credit facility 
assuming the prepayment condition is satisfied  we expect to be able to address the remaining scheduled principal payments in and through cash flow from operations 
however  if we were unable to meet the prepayment condition or service these obligations through cash flow from operations  then we would need to secure additional funding such as raising additional debt or equity  refinancing our existing facility  selling assets or using other means 
we may not be able to obtain financing or sell assets  at all or on favorable terms  or we may be contractually prevented by the terms of our senior notes or our senior credit facility from incurring additional indebtedness or selling assets 
once the payment condition is satisfied  we will have significant principal payments due in under our senior credit facility that we can address only by a comprehensive refinancing of our senior debt and possibly other debt instruments 
our ability to implement such a refinancing successfully is significantly dependent on material improvements in the debt markets 
our long term debt was issued by virgin media inc and certain of its subsidiaries that have no independent operations or significant assets other than investments in their respective subsidiaries 
as a result  they will depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from their respective subsidiaries to meet 
table of contents their obligations 
in addition  the terms of our existing and future indebtedness and the laws of the jurisdictions under which our subsidiaries are organized limit the payment of dividends  loan repayments and other distributions from them under many circumstances 
our debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to transfer cash between groups of our subsidiaries 
as a result of these restrictions  although our overall liquidity may be sufficient to satisfy our obligations  we may be limited by covenants in some of our debt agreements from transferring cash to other subsidiaries that might require funds 
in addition  cross default provisions in our other indebtedness may be triggered if we default on any of these debt agreements 
senior credit facility during  we entered into a senior credit facility in an aggregate principal sterling equivalent amount of  million  comprising a  million year amortizing tranche a term loan facility  a million year amortizing tranche a term loan facility  a million year bullet tranche b term loan facility  a million year bullet tranche b term loan facility  a million year bullet tranche b term loan facility  a million year bullet tranche b term loan facility  a million year bullet tranche c term loan facility and a million year multi currency revolving loan facility 
in april  we amended the senior credit facility and borrowed an additional million under a year bullet tranche b term loan facility and a year tranche b term loan facility and used the net proceeds to repay some of our obligations under the tranche a and tranche a term loan facilities 
in november  we further amended the senior credit facility to  among other things i subject to the repayment condition described below  defer the remaining principal payments due to consenting lenders under the existing tranche a and tranche a term loan facilities to june  through the transfer of those lenders participations to new tranche a and tranche a corresponding to tranche a and tranche a  respectively 
while the existing a tranches mature in march  with amortization payments due in and  the new a tranches will mature in june and will have no amortization payments prior to final maturity 
in total  lenders holding of the existing a tranches  million transferred their participations into the new a tranches  ii subject to the repayment condition described below  extend the maturity of the existing revolving facility in respect of consenting lenders from march to june  through the transfer of those lenders participations to a new revolving facility 
in total  lenders holding of the existing revolving facility transferred their participations into the new revolving facility  iii suspend the right of consenting lenders under the b tranches to receive a pro rata share of voluntary and mandatory prepayments until the outstanding amounts under all a tranches and the existing tranches b to b are repaid in full  through the transfer of those lenders participations to new tranches b to b corresponding to tranches b to b  respectively which do not have the right to pro rata prepayments 
in total  lenders holding of the existing b tranches  million transferred their participations into the new b tranches  iv provide flexibility to add tranches to the senior credit facility that will have a maturity no earlier than september  with no scheduled amortization payments prior to that date  to be used solely to repay debt under the senior credit facility  and v subject to the repayment condition described below  reset certain financial covenant ratios 
lenders who did not individually consent to transfer their participations to the new a tranches  b tranches and revolving facility remained in the existing a tranches  b tranches and revolving facility 

table of contents the changes to the repayment schedule under the new a tranches and new revolving facility and the reset of the financial covenant ratios amendments i  ii and v above will only become effective after we have repaid million of the amounts outstanding under the a tranches and the b b tranches 
we have repaid million of this amount and have until august  assuming we exercise the extension option at a cost of million to satisfy this repayment condition in respect of the remaining million 
we anticipate using cash generated from operations and cash on our balance sheet  which may be supplemented by amounts undrawn on our revolving credit facility  proceeds from debt offerings  or other sources  to pay the outstanding amount 
although we had million of cash on our balance sheet as at december   if we do not generate additional cash from operations or raise cash through other means  we may not be able to satisfy this prepayment condition 
if we fail to meet the prepayment condition  the current financial covenant ratios and debt amortization schedule under our senior credit facility will remain unchanged  with significant repayments due in and even if we do satisfy the prepayment condition  certain amortization payments remain due in and  as described below 
additionally  we have paid fees of million in in connection with the amendment and will pay additional fees of up to million upon satisfaction of the repayment condition 
principal amortization the principal payments on our senior credit facility at december   and after giving effect to the amendment assuming the repayment condition has been satisfied by repayment of of the a tranches and the b b tranches will be scheduled as follows in millions date amount pre amendment amount after giving effect to the amendment march  september  march  june  september  march  if we prepay any amounts due in and prior to their scheduled repayment  whether voluntarily or because the terms of our senior credit facility require us to make a prepayment  we will have to make simultaneous prepayments in respect of certain other tranches of the senior credit facility 
for example  assuming that the repayment condition has been satisfied and we subsequently choose to prepay million of the amounts due in  we would be required to make a simultaneous prepayment of million in respect of outstandings otherwise payable in interest margins the annual rate of interest payable under our senior credit facility is the sum of i the london intrabank offer rate libor  us libor or european intrabank offer rate euribor  as applicable  plus ii the applicable interest margin and the applicable cost of complying with any reserve requirement

derivative instruments and hedging activities we have a number of derivative instruments with a number of counterparties to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we account for certain of these instruments as accounting hedges under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or fas  when the appropriate eligibility criteria has been satisfied  and to the extent that they are effective 
ineffectiveness in our accounting hedges  and instruments that we have not elected for hedge accounting  are recognized through the consolidated statement of operations immediately 
effective cash flow accounting hedges are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded within other comprehensive income loss 
the derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 

table of contents we are subject to interest rate risk because we have substantial indebtedness at variable interest rates 
as of december   interest is determined on a variable basis on  million  or  of our indebtedness 
an increase in interest rates of would increase our gross interest expense by million per year  before giving effect to interest rate swaps 
we are also subject to currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenues  operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses are paid in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
to the extent that the pound sterling declines in value against the us dollar and the euro  the effective cost of servicing our us dollar and euro denominated debt will be higher 
changes in the exchange rate result in foreign currency gains or losses 
as of december    million  or of our indebtedness  was denominated in us dollars and million  or of our indebtedness  was denominated in euros 
we also purchase goods and services in us dollars and euros 
interest rate swaps we have entered into a number of interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk relating to the variability in future interest payments on our senior credit facility  which accrues interest at variable rates based on libor 
the interest rate swaps allow us to receive interest based on libor in exchange for payments of interest at fixed rates between and 
we have designated some of the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under fas because they hedge against changes in libor 
all interest rate swaps are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value

under these cross currency interest rate swaps  we receive interest in us dollars at various fixed and floating rates and in euros at various fixed and floating rates in exchange for payments of interest in pounds sterling at various fixed and floating rates 
we have designated some of the cross currency interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under fas  because they hedge against changes in the pound sterling value of the interest payments on the senior notes that result from changes in the us dollar and euro exchange rates 
all cross currency interest rate swaps are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value

the amounts initially recorded in other comprehensive income loss are then recorded in the statement of operations when the underlying hedged item impacts the statement of operations 

table of contents foreign currency forward contracts we have entered into a number of forward contracts maturing on april  to purchase a total of million 
these contracts economically hedge changes in the pound sterling value of the us dollar denominated principal obligation relating to the senior notes due caused by changes in the us dollar and pound sterling exchange rates 
the foreign exchange risk relating to principal obligations under the million senior notes due  the million senior notes due  and the million and million principal obligations under the senior credit facility is being mitigated through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps  and therefore separate forward rate contracts for these debt instruments were not necessary 
these foreign currency forward rate contracts have not been designated as accounting hedges under fas as such  the contracts are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with changes in the fair value recognized immediately through foreign currency losses gains in the consolidated statement of operations 
the foreign currency forward rate contracts do not subject us to material volatility in our earnings and cash flows because changes in the fair value directionally and partially mitigate the gains or losses on the remeasurement of our us dollar denominated debt into our reporting currency  pounds sterling  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 foreign currency translation 
changes in fair value of these contracts are reported within foreign currency transaction gains losses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  like foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
as some of our indebtedness accrues interest at variable rates  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with variable interest rate payments 
also  substantially all of our revenues  operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses are earned and paid in pounds sterling but we pay interest and principal obligations on some of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
as of december    million  or of our indebtedness  was denominated in us dollars and million  or  of our indebtedness was denominated in euros 
as a result  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with changes in foreign exchange rates on payments of principal and interest on a portion of our indebtedness 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  we have implemented a cash flow hedging program 
the objective of this program is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying rates 
to achieve this objective we have entered into a number of derivative instruments 
the derivative instruments utilized comprise interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes
