we are committed to creating and promoting a healthy way of life for the benefit of consumers  our customers  shareholders and employees 
the united states as well as worldwide economies have recently experienced adverse conditions  which may further decline 
these economic uncertainties have caused  and may continue to cause  customers and consumers to take a conservative position and further reduce their inventories and modify their spending habits 
in response  we continue to introduce new  innovative products  seeking to provide consumers with healthful  better for you products at reasonable prices 
in addition  we utilized and have recently increased our marketing support  using consumption orientated programs and consumer coupons to drive sales 
we have also been challenged in recent quarters by rising input costs 
although we have seen input costs begin to moderate  we strive to offset any continuing impact of input cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers 
during the past two years  we implemented workforce reductions and other productivity initiatives aimed at lowering our operating expenses in response to the current environment 
we will continue to monitor our costs and evaluate the need for additional actions 
in light of these economic conditions  we have experienced moderated sales growth  which we expect will continue  but may be subject to further fluctuation 
our net sales increased in fiscal the net sales increase was driven by modest growth achieved in our core brands in north america and an increase in sales by hpp  which were partially offset by reduced sales volume and the impacts of unfavorable changes in exchange rates in our european operations 
our continent based european operations achieved modest sales growth measured in local currency  while local currency sales in our united kingdom based operations declined in fiscal in addition to the ongoing weak global economic conditions  the significant strengthening of the us dollar since the end of our last fiscal year has had an adverse impact on our results 
our core grocery  snacks  tea and personal care brands are sold via multiple channels throughout north america 
our primary focus is to deliver healthful  innovative products that provide value to the consumer 
in the united states  we introduced over new products across our core categories in the last year 
we have been able to successfully expand our earth s best brand from its original jarred baby foods into infant formula  toddler snacks  frozen products and diapers 
we are aggressively pursuing expansion of our healthful  better for you product offerings  including  for example  over gluten free products 
we have re launched our celestial seasonings line of green teas with enhanced taste and expanded the flavors offered by our leading sleepytime herbal tea 
despite the challenging economic conditions  our results at these reporting units remained profitable 

table of contents hain pure protein recorded a loss before income tax 
in addition to an impairment charge for goodwill  hpp s results were severely impacted by higher feed costs and an unfavorable sales mix skewed to conventional poultry products  which suffered lower market prices for much of the year 
in europe we had a loss before income tax as a result of the impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles and a loss from operations in the united kingdom 
in the united kingdom  we are addressing the challenges of the under utilization of our fakenham production facility with new frozen meat free and dessert products  which we expect will bring new sales into that plant 
we are also undertaking to recover the volume decline resulting from the phased reduction of a supply arrangement with the exclusive customer for products from our fresh prepared food to go factory 
we have introduced a new brand  pick me under license targeted at new retail customers and seek to further expand our recently acquired daily bread brand  whose production is currently being consolidated into our luton food to go facility 
we are also in discussions with numerous british retailers to become a supplier of their food to go products 
recent developments the company periodically assesses its operations to ensure that they are efficient  aligned with market conditions and responsive to customer needs 
during fiscal  the company undertook several actions to improve performance and position the company for future growth 
we implemented a stock keeping unit sku rationalization  principally in our celestial seasonings tea products  to eliminate skus based on low sales volume or insufficient margins and position the celestial seasonings line for increased consumption and sales growth and improved profitability 
we also initiated a plan to streamline and integrate the back office and warehousing operations of our personal care operations into other locations we operate 
with this activity  we also completed the sku rationalization of our personal care products begun in fiscal these actions collectively resulted in pre tax charges of million  which includes million charged to cost of sales for inventory and related items and million charged to general and administrative expenses for severance and other costs 
on february   we entered into a license agreement with martha stewart living omnimedia  inc mslo to develop  manufacture  market  sell and distribute a new line of natural home cleaning solutions under the martha stewart clean brand 
in collaboration with the mslo design team  hain celestial has developed the products for this line  which are primarily derived from plants and minerals 
it is expected that the products will launch in the fall of during the quarter ended march   based on a combination of factors  including a sustained decline in the company s market capitalization below the company s carrying value during the fiscal quarter ended march   and coupled with challenging macro economic conditions  we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
as a result of the interim impairment analysis performed in the third quarter and the annual analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded non cash impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles of million 
on june   the minority owner in hpp acquired a controlling interest in the joint venture through the purchase of newly issued shares of hpp 
as a result  the company s equity interest was reduced to and  effective june   the company deconsolidated hpp and began accounting for its investment in hpp under the equity method of accounting 
beginning on july   the revenues and expenses of hpp will no longer be consolidated and the company s share of hpp s results will be reported as a separate line on the consolidated statement of operations 
the company s consolidated statements of operations for all periods prior to july  include the revenues and expenses of hpp 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
table of contents net sales for the year ended june  were billion  an increase of million  or  over net sales of billion for the year ended june  our net sales in the united states increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
net sales in the united states excluding hpp increased  reflecting the strong performance of many of our core grocery and snacks brands 
our earth s best brand continued to grow at a double digit rate  along with increases across several other brands  including imagine soup  rice dream non dairy beverages  garden of eatin snacks  arrowhead mills flours and bake mixes  deboles pasta  spectrum naturals and rosetto frozen pasta 
we also had a full year of sales of the maranatha and sunspire brands  acquired in march these increases were partially offset by lower full year sales of our celestial seasonings tea brand and our personal care brands 
after recent years of slowing growth in tea  we focused on our core skus at celestial seasonings  which resulted in restarting consumption growth and producing increased shipments in this fiscal year s fourth quarter 
for the full year  celestial seasonings sales were impacted by foreign exchange rates and a change in promotional spending to increase the use of consumer coupons  the redemption of which is recorded as a reduction of sales  as well as reductions of inventory generally in the distribution and retail industries 
the recently implemented sku rationalization is expected to better position celestial seasonings to build on this improvement 
our sales of our personal care brands have been impacted by weakness in the drugstore channel 
we have a full complement of new products for personal care  highlighted by the introduction of our rainforest skin and hair care products 
sales in the united states also included million of sales from hpp  an increase of million from sales of million in approximately of hpp s sales were conventional poultry  which carry lower margins 
hpp intends its future product mix to emphasize antibiotic free and kosher antibiotic free products  which it expects will return it to profitability 
as a result of the deconsolidation of hain pure protein  beginning in fiscal those revenues and expenses will no longer be consolidated in our results  but will be included in our net income under the equity method of accounting 
our international sales were million  accounting for of our consolidated sales 
our international sales were significantly impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates  the discontinuation of a co pack agreement in the united kingdom and the phasing out of the supply of fresh sandwiches to a major united kingdom retailer 
the weakening of foreign currencies decreased reported sales by million  or 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended june  was million  a decrease of million  or  from last year s gross profit of million 
gross profit in fiscal was of net sales compared to of net sales for gross profit was impacted by million in fiscal and million in fiscal for sku rationalization  severance and other reorganization costs as we continued to focus on cost reduction and production efficiencies 
with the implementation in this year s fourth quarter of the sku rationalization of our celestial seasonings products and last year s personal care products sku rationalization and other reorganization activities  we believe we have positioned these brands for improved profitability and growth 
gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by increased sales at hpp  coupled with an unfavorable sales mix between antibiotic free and conventional product and severely decreased gross margins resulting from higher feed costs and lower market prices for conventional poultry 
hpp s gross margins declined in the current year  resulting in a basis point unfavorable impact on consolidated gross margin  and which was basis points greater than hpp s dilutive effect on fiscal consolidated gross margin 
we experienced an unfavorable impact related to under absorbed overhead at our fakenham frozen meat free facility as a result of the expiration of a co pack agreement with the former owner  impacting gross profit by approximately million  or basis points 
in response to the weakening economic conditions  we selectively increased the rate of our spending in fiscal on consumer coupons  advertising  promotional and other discounts in some of our markets to maintain sales  which had an basis point unfavorable effect on gross margin 
the increases in input costs we experienced at the end of last fiscal year and into the beginning of this year have begun to ease and have been offset by favorable pricing and productivity improvements 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal include increased equity compensation costs recorded in accordance with sfas no 
r of approximately million compared to fiscal we also incurred increased costs for other legal and professional services of approximately million 
fiscal s expenses include a million charge to settle a personal injury litigation matter 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the costs we incurred for professional fees related to the review of our stock option practices and defense of the related derivative lawsuits of million  including a million insurance reimbursement received 
we incurred million of charges related to our sku rationalization and reorganization in fiscal compared to million of charges recorded in fiscal impairment of goodwill and other intangibles we recognized non cash impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles of million during the third quarter of fiscal the charges included million for goodwill  net of million attributed to the minority interest of our hpp joint venture  and million for other intangibles  as described below 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs its annual goodwill impairment test on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter 
in addition  if and when events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its reporting units below its carrying value  an interim test is performed 
the company completed its annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of that analysis 
based upon a combination of factors including a sustained decline in the company s market capitalization below the company s carrying value during the fiscal quarter ended march   coupled with challenging macro economic conditions  the company concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require it to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis at march  accordingly  the company performed an interim first step of its goodwill impairment test for each of its six reporting units 
for purposes of this analysis  our estimates of fair values were based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of each reporting unit based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of the reporting units based on comparable market prices of each such unit 
the income approach requires that assumptions be made for  among others  forecasted revenues  gross profit margins  operating profit margins  working capital cash flow  perpetual growth rates and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments by management 
as a result of this step one analysis  the company determined that the carrying value of its protein and europe reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values  indicating potential goodwill impairment existed 
having determined that the goodwill of these two reporting units was potentially impaired  the company began performing the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis which involved calculating the implied fair value of its goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets and comparing the residual amount to the carrying value of goodwill 
accordingly  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recognized an estimated pre tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  net of million attributed to the minority interest of its hpp joint venture  to write off all of the goodwill related to its protein and europe reporting units 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company finalized its goodwill impairment analysis with no further adjustment required 
the non cash charge has no impact on the company s compliance with debt covenants  its cash flows or available liquidity 
in april  the company was informed by the exclusive customer of its fresh prepared sandwich business in the united kingdom that the customer s purchases from the company would be significantly reduced in phases with reductions through april  after which the company could potentially supply certain specialty food to go products which are currently in a test phase with this customer 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal or impairment of long lived assets  the company performed an impairment test on the intangible asset associated with the customer relationship  which was being amortized 
the projected undiscounted future cash flows related to this customer relationship were determined to be less than the carrying value  and as a result  the company recognized a full impairment loss of million in the third quarter of fiscal

critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies below have been identified as the critical accounting policies we use which require us to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented 
we believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies  however  it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using assumptions  estimates or making judgments different from those that we have applied 
our critical accounting policies are as follows  including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used revenue recognition and sales incentives sales are recognized when the earnings process is complete  which occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements  title and risk of loss transfer to customers  collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable 
sales are reported net of sales incentives  which include trade discounts and promotions and certain coupon costs 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in reported sales 
allowances for cash discounts are recorded in the period in which the related sale is recognized 
valuation of accounts and chargebacks receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations on existing and new customers daily 
we apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply a general reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories 
credit losses have been within our expectations in recent years 
while united natural foods  inc represented approximately of our trade receivable balance at june   we believe there is no significant or unusual credit exposure at this time 
based on cash collection history and other statistical analysis  we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken to be repaid and collectible in the near future in the form of a chargeback receivable 
while our estimate of this receivable balance could be different had we used different assumptions and made different judgments  historically our cash collections of this type of receivable have been within our expectations and no significant write offs have occurred during the most recent three fiscal years 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we would have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions  or with changes in business conditions  such as consolidation within the food industry and or a change in the way we market and sell our products 
inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of actual cost or market  utilizing the first in  first out method 
we provide write downs for finished goods expected to become non saleable due to age and specifically identify and provide for slow moving or obsolete raw ingredients and packaging 
property  plant and equipment our property  plant and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or lease life  whichever is shorter 
we believe the asset lives assigned to our property  plant and equipment are within the ranges guidelines generally used in food manufacturing and distribution businesses 
our manufacturing plants and distribution centers  and their related assets  are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment exists by analyzing underlying cash flow projections 
at this time  we believe no impairment exists on the carrying value of such assets 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
accounting for acquisitions part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses 
the purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business  market research  strategic planning  and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies 
estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to judgment as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources 
our acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under sfas no 
 business combinations 
we estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment 
these estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  operating leases and deferred income taxes 
in determining the fair values of property  plant and equipment as well as intangible assets we often obtain the assistance of third party valuation firms 
we complete these assessments as soon as practical 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with some of our acquisitions  we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings 
our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities  reductions in staffing levels  and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire 
the estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and  as such  affect the ultimate recording of goodwill consistent with the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
it is typical for us to rationalize the product lines of businesses acquired within the first year or two after an acquisition 
these rationalizations often include elimination of portions of the product lines acquired  the reformulation of recipes and formulas used to produce the products  and the elimination of customers that do not meet our credit standards 
in certain instances  it is necessary to change co packers used to produce the products 
each of these activities soon after an acquisition may have the effect of reducing sales to a level lower than that of the business acquired and operated prior to our acquisition 
as a result  pro forma information regarding sales cannot and should not be construed as representative of our growth rates 
stock based compensation we provide compensation benefits in the form of stock options and restricted stock to employees and non employee directors under several stock based plans 
we account for stock based awards in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that stock based compensation be measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service 
table of contents period 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight line method 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the option  the risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant and is recognized in expense over the vesting period using the straight line method 
sfas no 
r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only that portion of stock based awards that are expected to vest

segments sfas no 
defines an operating segment as that component of an enterprise i that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses  ii whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise s chief operating decision maker codm to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance  and iii for which discrete financial information is available 
sfas no 
defines a reporting unit as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
the company has determined that it operates in one segment  the sale of natural and organic products  including food  beverage and personal care products  and further that such single segment includes six reporting units in the annual test of goodwill for impairment 
characteristics of the company s operations which are relied on in making these determinations include the similarities apparent in the company s products in the natural and organic consumer markets  the commonality of the company s customers across brands  the company s unified marketing strategy  and the nature of the financial information used by the codm  described below  other than information on sales and direct product costs  by brand 
the company s six reporting units were grocery including snacks  tea  personal care  protein  canada  and europe 
the company has further determined that its chairman of the board and chief executive officer is the company s codm as defined in sfas no 
 and is also the manager of the company s single segment 
in making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment  the company s codm focuses on sales performance by brand using internally generated sales data as well as externally developed market consumption data acquired from independent sources  and further reviews certain data regarding standard costs and standard gross margins by brand 
in making these decisions  the codm receives and reviews certain company consolidated quarterly and year to date information  however  the codm does not receive or review any discrete financial information by geographic location  business unit  subsidiary  division or brand 
the codm reviews and approves capital spending on a company consolidated basis rather than at any lower unit level 
the company s board of directors receives the same quarterly and year to date information as the company s codm 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset is amortized over its useful life unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
the carrying values of goodwill  which is allocated to the company s reporting units  and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or earlier if indications of impairment exist 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired 
at this point we proceed to a step two analysis  wherein we measure the excess  if any  of the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value  and record the impairment loss indicated 
the estimate of the fair values of our reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment 
we generally use a blended analysis of the present value of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flow model uses the present values of estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external economic factors in estimating 
table of contents our future cash flows 
the assumptions we use in our evaluations include projections of growth rates and profitability  our estimated working capital needs  as well as our weighted average cost of capital 
the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of a reporting unit based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in similar businesses 
estimates used in the market value approach include the identification of similar companies with comparable business factors 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the assumptions we made could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names and trademarks 
the measurement of fair value for these assets is based on the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that the trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved from paying royalties for the benefits received 
we estimate the future revenues for the associated brands  the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital

seasonality our tea brand primarily manufactures and markets hot tea products and  as a result  its quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends resulting from increased demand for its hot tea products in the cooler months of the year 
in addition  some of our other products eg  baking and cereal products and soups also show stronger sales in the cooler months while our snack food and certain of our prepared food product lines are stronger in the warmer months 
in years where there are warm winter seasons  our sales of cooler weather products  which typically increase in our second and third fiscal quarters  may be negatively impacted 
quarterly fluctuations in our sales volume and operating results are due to a number of factors relating to our business  including the timing of trade promotions  advertising and consumer promotions and other factors  such as seasonality  inclement weather and unanticipated increases in labor  commodity  energy  insurance or other operating costs 
the impact on sales volume and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business 
for these reasons  you should not rely on our quarterly operating results as indications of future performance 
off balance sheet arrangements at june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k that have had or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation inflation has caused increased ingredient  fuel  labor and benefits costs and in some cases has materially increased our operating expenses 
for more information regarding ingredient costs  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ingredient inputs price risk 
to the extent permitted by competition  we seek to recover increased costs through a combination of price increases  new product innovation and by implementing process efficiencies and cost reductions 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on debt and cash equivalents  foreign exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses  and ingredient inputs 
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and cash equivalents  considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of commercial paper and obligations of us government agencies 
as of june   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
assuming current cash equivalents and variable rate borrowings  a hypothetical change in average interest rates of one percentage point would not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows over the next fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange rates operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times  and the impact of such movements  if material  could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  while such sales outside the united states were of net sales in and of net sales in these revenues  along with related expenses and capital purchases are conducted in british pounds sterling  euros and canadian dollars 
in june  we entered into forward contracts for the purpose of reducing the effect of exchange rate changes on forecasted intercompany purchases by our canadian subsidiary  which we have designated as cash flow hedges 
we had approximately million in notional amounts of forward contracts at june  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the stockholders equity of the company 
amounts invested in our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at fiscal year end 
any resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the cumulative translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income decreased million during the fiscal year ended june  ingredient inputs price risk the company purchases ingredient inputs such as wheat  corn  soybeans  canola oil and fruit as well as packaging materials  to be used in its operations 
these inputs are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk 
we do not attempt to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the ingredients by using future  forward  option or other derivative instruments 
as a result  the majority of our future purchases of these items are subject to changes in price 
we may enter into fixed purchase commitments in an attempt to secure an adequate supply of specific 
table of contents ingredients 
these agreements are tied to specific market prices 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of our primary inputs as of june  based on our cost of goods sold during the twelve months ended june   such a change would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales of approximately million 
we attempt to offset the impact of input cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers
