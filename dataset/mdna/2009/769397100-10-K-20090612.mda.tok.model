dividends per share divided by earnings per share item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto contained in item of this form k and the other sections contained in this form k 
critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified three policies  that due to judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of investment securities  the valuation of reo and foreclosed assets  goodwill valuation and the calculation of income taxes 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussions and analysis contained herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in particular  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  describes generally the company s accounting policies 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is provided based upon management s ongoing quarterly assessment of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency levels  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes techniques to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
the allowance consists of specific  general and unallocated components 
the specific component relates to loans that are considered impaired 
for such loans that are classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the net realizable value of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers non impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
such factors include uncertainties in economic conditions  uncertainties in identifying triggering events that directly correlate to subsequent loss rates  changes in appraised value of underlying collateral  risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors and historical loss experience data that may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio or economic conditions 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
the appropriate allowance level is estimated based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
when available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof are uncollectible  identified amounts are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
the existence of some or all of the following criteria will generally confirm that a loss has been incurred the loan is significantly delinquent and the borrower has not demonstrated the ability or intent to bring the loan current  the bank has no recourse to the borrower  or if it does  the borrower has insufficient assets to pay the debt  the estimated fair value of the loan collateral is significantly below the current loan balance  and there is little or no near term prospect for improvement 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 an amendment of sfas no 
 a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans such as consumer secured loans  residential mortgage loans and consumer unsecured loans are collectively evaluated for potential loss 
impaired loans are generally carried at the lower of cost or fair value  which are determined by management based upon a number of factors  including recent independent appraisals which are further reduced for estimated selling costs or as a practical expedient by estimating the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
when the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan including accrued interest  net deferred loan fees or costs  and unamortized premium or discount  impairment is recognized by creating or adjusting an allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
investment valuation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities are classified as held to maturity when the company has the ability and positive intent to hold such securities to maturity 
investment securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
unrealized losses due to fluctuations in fair value are recognized when it is determined that a credit related other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
investment securities bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities 
securities that the company intends to hold for an indefinite period  but not necessarily to maturity are classified as available for sale 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses  net of the related deferred tax effect  are reported as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders equity entitled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on securities available for sale  determined using the specific identification method  are included in earnings 
premiums and discounts are amortized using the interest method over the period to maturity or expected call  if sooner 
unrealized losses on available for sale and held to maturity securities are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether the declines in value should be considered other than temporary 
in accordance with fsp  otti is separated into a credit and noncredit component 
noncredit component losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss when the company a does not intend to sell the security or b is not more likely than not to have to sell the security prior to the security s anticipated recovery 
credit component losses are reported through earnings 
to determine the component of otti related to credit losses  the company compares the amortized cost basis of the otti security to the present value of the revised expected cash flows  discounted using the current pre impairment yield 
expected cash flow estimates are based primarily on an analysis of default rates  prepayment speeds and third party analytical reports 
significant judgment of management is required in this analysis that includes  but is not limited to  assumptions regarding the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest on the underlying collateral 
although the determination of whether an impairment is other than temporary involves significant judgment  the underlying principle used is based on positive evidence indicating that an investment s carrying value is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs negative evidence to the contrary 
evidence that is objectively determinable and verifiable is given greater weight than evidence that is subjective and or not verifiable 
evidence based on future events will generally be less objective as it is based on future expectations and therefore is generally less verifiable or not verifiable at all 
factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary include  a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and c the company s intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time 
other factors that may be considered include the ratings by recognized rating agencies  capital strength and other near term prospects of the issuer and recommendation of investment advisors or market analysts 
in situations in which the security s fair value is below amortized cost but it continues to be probable that all contractual terms of the security will be satisfied  the decline is solely attributable to noncredit factors  and the company asserts that it has positive intent and ability to hold that security to maturity  no other than temporary impairment is recognized 
valuation of reo and foreclosed assets real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure reo are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
fair value is generally determined by management based on a number of factors  including third party appraisals of fair value in an orderly sale 
accordingly  the valuation of reo is subject to significant external and internal judgment 
any differences between management s assessment of fair value  less estimated costs to sell  and the carrying value of the loan at the date a particular property is transferred into reo are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically reviews reo values to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or fair value  net of estimated costs to sell 
any further decreases in the value of reo are considered valuation adjustments and trigger a corresponding charge to non interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
expenses from the maintenance and operations of reo are included in other non interest expense 
goodwill valuation goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested  at least annually  for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the company has one reporting unit  the bank  for purposes of computing goodwill 
all of the company s goodwill has been allocated to this single reporting unit 
the company performs an annual review in the third quarter of each year  or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill at the reporting unit level is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and additional analysis must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  the company would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  the company would record an impairment charge for the difference 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others  a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  and unanticipated competition 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the company estimates fair value using the best information available  including market information and a discounted cash flow analysis  which is also referred to as the income approach 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a rate that reflects current market conditions 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in loans and deposits  estimates of future expected changes in net interest margins and cash expenditures 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting unit 
we validate our estimated fair value by comparing the fair value estimates using the income approach to the fair value estimates using the market approach 
income taxes the company estimates tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position

operating strategy fiscal year marked the th anniversary since the bank opened its doors in the historical emphasis had been on residential real estate lending 
since  however  the company has been diversifying its loan portfolio through the expansion of its commercial and construction loan portfolios 
at march   commercial and construction loans represented of total loans 
commercial lending including commercial real estate has higher credit risk  wider interest margins and shorter terms than residential lending which can increase the loan portfolio s profitability 
the company s growing commercial customer base has enjoyed new products and the improvements in existing products 
these new products include business checking  internet banking  remote deposit capture  expanded cash management services  bankcard merchant services  cdars deposit offerings and new loan products 
retail customers have benefited from expanded choices ranging from additional automated teller machines  consumer lending products  checking accounts  debit cards  hour account information service and internet banking 
during fiscal year  the company opened a new full service branch and commercial lending center gateway branch in portland  oregon 
during fiscal year  the company opened a new lending office in clackamas oregon and relocated one of its leased branches in vancouver into a new company owned facility 
the company s relationship banking has continued to be enhanced by the addition of ramcorp  a trust company directed by experienced trust officers 
assets under management by ramcorp 
totaled million at march  the company s relationship banking has also benefited through expanded loan products serviced by experienced commercial and consumer lending officers  and an expanded branch network led by experienced branch managers 
development of relationship banking has been the key to the company s growth 
in response to the adverse economic conditions  the company has been  and will continue to work toward reducing the amount of nonperforming assets  adjusting the balance sheet by reducing loan totals and other assets as possible  reducing controllable operating costs  and augmenting deposits while maintaining available secured borrowing facilities to improve liquidity and preserve capital over the coming fiscal year 
in this regard  as part of our strategic planning  we are currently considering raising additional capital 
we anticipate that this capital will be raised through non government sources for the purpose of increasing our capital position and achieving compliance with the additional capital requirements contained in the mou 
this additional capital would also be available to support our future acquisitions 
we do not  however  have any plans arrangements or understandings regarding any acquisition transactions 
we have not decided on the type of securities we will issue but it may include common stock  preferred stock  warrants or a combination of these obligations 
comparison of financial condition at march  and at march   the company had total assets of million compared with million at march  the increase in total assets was primarily a result of the increase in the balance of loans outstanding 
cash  including interest earning accounts  totaled million at march   compared to million at march  the million decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash balances maintained at the frb as a result of the implementation of check during the second quarter of fiscal and the utilization of cash to fund loan production 
investment securities available for sale totaled million at march   compared to million at march  the million increase was attributable to the purchase of a million agency security  offset by an impairment charge of million as well as scheduled maturities 
mortgage backed securities available for sale totaled million at march   compared to million at march  the million decrease was a result of pay downs 
the company does not believe it has any exposure to sub prime mortgage backed securities 
loans receivable  net  was million at march   compared to million at march   a increase 
net loans receivable decreased million  or  at march  compared to the previous linked quarter primarily as a result of million in loans transferred to reo and million in charge offs 
a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate  either as primary or secondary collateral  located in the company s primary market area 
risks associated with loans secured by real estate include decreasing land and property values  material increases in interest rates  deterioration in local economic conditions  tightening credit or refinancing markets  and a concentration of loans within any one area 
the company has no sub prime residential real estate loans in its portfolio 
goodwill was million at march  and the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter ended december  the results of these tests indicated that the company s goodwill was not impaired 
for additional information on our goodwill impairment testing  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations goodwill valuation 
deposit accounts totaled million at march  compared to million at march  the impact of falling interest rates during fiscal year has resulted in a shift in customer deposit choices from money market deposit and interest checking accounts into certificates of deposit 
as a result  the balance of certificates of deposit increased million to million at march   compared to million at march  total brokered deposits at march  were million  or of total deposits compared to million  or of total deposits  at march  customer relationship deposits balances increased million since march  fhlb advances decreased to million at march  as compared to million at march  the decrease was the result of the company s advances from the frb during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  frb advances totaled million at march  the decision to shift the company s borrowings to the frb during the quarter was due to lower cost of frb borrowings as compared to those from the fhlb 
shareholders equity decreased million to million at march  from million at march  the decrease in equity resulting from cash dividends declared to shareholders of million and a net loss of million for the year ended march  the decrease was partially offset by the exercise of stock options  earned esop shares and the net tax effect of sfas no 
adjustment to securities of  goodwill valuation as part of our process for performing the step one impairment test of goodwill  the company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing the income approach and the market approach in order to derive an enterprise value of the company 
assumptions used by the company in its discounted cash flow model income approach included an annual revenue growth rate that approximated  a net interest margin that approximated and a return on assets that ranged from to average of 
in addition to utilizing the above projections of estimated operating results  key assumptions used to determine the fair value estimate under the income approach was the discount rate of percent utilized for our cash flow estimates and a terminal value estimated at times the ending book value of the reporting unit 
the company used a build up approach in developing the discount rate that included an assessment of the risk free interest rate  the rate of return expected from publicly traded stocks  the industry the company operates in and the size of the company 
the estimated market capitalization considers trends in our market capitalization and an expected control premium 
the company used an expected control premium of  which was based on comparable transactional history 
in applying the market approach method  the company selected nine publicly traded comparable institutions based on a variety of financial metrics tangible equity  leverage ratio  return on assets  return on equity  net interest margin  nonperforming assets  net charge offs  and reserves for loan losses and other relevant qualitative factors geographical location  lines of business  business model  risk profile  availability of financial information  etc 
after selecting comparable institutions  the company derived the fair value of the reporting unit by completing a comparative analysis of the relationship between their financial metrics listed above and their market values utilizing various market multiples 
the company calculated a fair value of its reporting unit of million using the income approach and million using the market approach 
based on the results of the step one impairment analysis  the company determined the second step must be performed 
the company calculated the implied fair value of its reporting unit under the step two goodwill impairment test 
under this approach  the company calculated the fair value for its unrecognized deposit intangible  as well as the remaining assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
significant adjustments were made to the fair value of the company s loans receivable compared to its recorded value 
key assumptions used in its fair value estimate of loans receivable was the discount for comparable loan sales 
the company used a weighted average discount valuation that approximated the discount for similar loan sales by the fdic during the past year 
the company segregated its loan portfolio into seven categories  including performing loans  nonperforming loans and sub performing loans 
the weighted average discount valuation for these individual categories ranged from for performing loans to for nonperforming real estate loans 
based on results of the step two impairment test  the company determined no impairment charge of goodwill was required 
an interim impairment test was not deemed necessary as of march   due to there not being a significant change in the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  the amount that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value as of the most recent valuation  and because the company determined that  based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent valuation date  the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote 
even though the company determined that there was no goodwill impairment during fiscal year  continued declines in the value of our stock price as well as values of others in the financial industry  declines in revenue for the bank beyond our current forecasts and significant adverse changes in the operating environment for the financial industry may result in a future impairment charge 
it is possible that changes in circumstances  existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future  or in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments  assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill  could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of our goodwill 
if the company recorded an impairment charge  its financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected  however  such an impairment charge would have no impact on our liquidity  operations or regulatory capital 
fair value of level assets the company fair values certain assets that are classified as level under the fair value hierarchy established in sfas no 
these level assets are valued using significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets 
these level assets include certain available for sale securities  loans measured for impairment  and reo for which there is neither an active market for identical assets from which to determine fair value  nor is there sufficient  current market information about similar assets to use as observable  corroborated data for all significant inputs in a valuation model 
under these circumstances  the fair values of these assets are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  appraisals  valuation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and or similar techniques  for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
valuations using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs 
where market data is available  the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of the valuation date 
in periods of extreme volatility  lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets  there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process 
judgment is then applied in formulating those inputs 
at march   the market for the company s single trust preferred pooled security was determined to be inactive in management s judgment 
this determination was made by the company after considering the last known trade date for this specific security  the low number of transactions for similar types of securities  the low number of new issuances for similar securities  the significant increase in the implied liquidity risk premium for similar securities  the lack of information that is released publicly and discussions with third party industry analysts 
due to the inactivity in the market  observable market data was not readily available for all significant inputs for this security 
accordingly  the trust preferred pooled security was classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the company utilized observable inputs where available  unobservable data and modeled the cash flows adjusted by an appropriate liquidity and credit risk adjusted discount rate using an income approach valuation technique in order to measure the fair value of the security 
significant unobservable inputs were used that reflect our assumptions of what a market participant would use to price the security 
significant unobservable inputs included selecting an appropriate discount rate  default rate and repayment assumptions 
in selecting our assumptions  we considered the current rates for similarly rated corporate securities  market liquidity  the individual issuer s financial conditions  historical repayment information  and future expectations of the capital markets 
the reasonableness of the fair value  and classification as a level asset  was validated through comparison of fair value as determined by two independent third party pricing services 
certain loans included in the loan portfolio were deemed impaired in accordance with sfas no 
at march  accordingly  loans measured for impairment were classified as level in the fair value hierarchy as there is no active market for these loans 
measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates  and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates 
impairment was measured based on a number of factors  including recent independent appraisals which are further reduced for estimated selling costs or as a practical expedient by estimating the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
in addition  reo was classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
management generally determines fair value based on a number of factors  including third party appraisals of fair value less estimated costs to sell 
the valuation of reo is subject to significant external and internal judgment  and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates 
for additional information on our level  and fair value measurements see note fair value measurement in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net income or loss 
net loss was million  or per diluted earning share for the year ended march   compared to net income of million  or per diluted share for the year ended march  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income  an increase in the provision for loan losses and a million otti charge related to a trust preferred security held by the company 
net interest income 
net interest income for fiscal year was million  representing a million  or a decrease  from million in fiscal year the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the fiscal year ended march   which indicates that the interest earning asset growth is being funded more by interest bearing liabilities as compared to capital and non interest bearing demand deposits 
the net interest margin for the fiscal year ended march  was compared to for the same prior year period 
generally  the company s balance sheet interest rate sensitivity achieves better net interest rate margins in a stable or increasing interest rate environment due to the balance sheet being slightly asset interest rate sensitive 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the company requires time to reduce deposit interest rates to recover the decline in the net interest rate margin 
interest rates on the company s interest earning assets reprice down faster than interest rates on the company s interest bearing liabilities 
as a result of the federal reserve s basis point reduction in the short term federal funds rate during the year ended march   approximately of the company s loans immediately repriced down basis points 
the company also immediately reduced the interest rate paid on certain interest bearing deposits 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made further progress in reducing its deposit and borrowing costs 
further reductions will be reflected in future deposit offering rates 
the amount and timing of these reductions is dependent on competitive pricing pressures  yield curve shape and changes in spreads 
interest income 
interest income was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million  for the fiscal year ended march  decreases in interest income were due to the federal reserve rate cuts described above as well as interest income reversals on nonperforming loans 
the yield on interest earning assets was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year during the year ended march  and  the company reversed  and  respectively  of interest income on nonperforming loans 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in the average loan balance due to continued loan growth 
average interest bearing assets increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year other interest and dividend income decreased  to  for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year this decrease was due to a reduction in yield on daily interest bearing assets to for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year as well as a reduction in the average balance of such assets 
the decrease in the yield for such assets was primarily due to falling interest rates during the year due to the federal reserve interest rate cuts described above 
interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  totaled million  a million or decrease from million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in interest expense is the result of lower rates of interest paid on deposits and borrowings as a result of the federal reserve interest rate cuts described above 
the weighted average interest rate on interest bearing deposits decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the weighted average interest rate of fhlb borrowings decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the significantly greater provision for loan losses is primarily the result of the current economic conditions and slowdown in residential real estate sales that affected among others  homebuilders and developers 
a slowdown in home buying has resulted in slower sales and declining real estate values which have significantly affected these borrowers liquidity and ability to repay loans 
this slowdown has led to an increase in delinquent and nonperforming construction and land development loans as well as additional loan charge offs 
nonperforming loans generally reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower  however  more recently the deterioration in the general economy has become a significant contributing factor to the increased levels of delinquencies and nonperforming loans 
net charge offs for the year ended march  were million  compared to  for the same period last year 
the increase in net charge offs is primarily attributable to the charge off of land and lot loans totaling million  speculative construction loans totaling million and commercial loans totaling million for the year ended march  net charge offs to average net loans for the year ended march  were  compared to for the same period last year 
nonperforming loans increased to million at march  compared to million at march  the ratio of allowance for loan losses and unfunded loan commitments to total net loans was at march   compared to at march  the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans decreased to at march   compared to at march  the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans decreased as more of the nonperforming loan balances have been reduced to expected recovery values as a result of specific impairment analysis and related charge offs 
the problem loans identified by the company largely consist of land acquisition and development loans 
impaired loans are subjected to an impairment analysis to determine an appropriate reserve amount to be held against each loan 
as of march   the company had identified million of impaired loans as defined by sfas no 
because the significant majority of our impaired loans are collateral dependent  nearly all of our specific allowances are calculated on the fair value of the collateral 
of those impaired loans  million have no specific valuation allowance as their estimated collateral value is equal to or exceeds the carrying costs 
the remaining million have specific valuation allowances totaling million 
management s evaluation of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing  quarterly assessments of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience with additional consideration and adjustments made for changes in economic conditions  changes in the amount and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  a detailed analysis of impaired loans and other factors as deemed appropriate 
these factors are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
loss rates used by the company are impacted as changes in these risk factors increase or decrease from quarter to quarter 
at march   management s analysis placed greater emphasis on the company s construction and land development loan portfolios and the effect of various factors such as geographic and loan type concentrations 
the company also considered the effects of declining home values and slower home sales 
based on its comprehensive analysis  management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at march  of total loans and of nonperforming loans adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the same period in the decrease in non interest income is primarily due to the otti charge of million on a trust preferred security taken during the second quarter of fiscal year for the year ended march   broker loan fees decreased by  compared to the year ended march  primarily as a result the slowdown in real estate loan sales 
the decrease in asset management fees of  for the year ended march  compared to the same prior year period corresponds with the decrease in assets under management by ramcorp 
from million at march  to million at march  the decrease in value of assets under management is primarily attributable to the decline in the stock market during fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by an increase of  in gains on loans held for sale  as well as the reversal of  for a contingent liability previously reserved for a property  which the company disposed of during the fourth quarter of fiscal year non interest expense 
non interest expense decreased  to million for fiscal year ended march  compared to million for fiscal year ended march  management continues to focus on managing controllable costs as the company proactively adjusts to lower levels of real estate lending activity 
the principal components of the decrease in the company s non interest expense were decreases in salaries and employee benefits and marketing expenses 
for the year ended march   salaries and employee benefits  which includes mortgage broker commission compensation  was million  a decrease over the prior year total of million 
salaries decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of full time equivalent employees from at march  to at march   and as a result of the decrease in mortgage broker commissions 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the company s fdic deposit insurance premium of  for the year ended march   compared to the same prior year period 
the fdic insurance premiums increased primarily as a result of a one time fdic credit  which the company applied against its insurance expense in fiscal year  and as a result of an industry wide increase in fdic insurance premiums 
we expect our deposit insurance premiums to increase substantially in fiscal year as a result of recent fdic imposed increases in the assessment rates 
in addition  reo related expenses which includes operating costs  write downs  and losses on the disposition of property increased  for the year ended march  compared to the same prior year period 
professional fees increased  from the year ended march  due primarily to increased legal fees related to problem assets  including reo 
we expect reo related expense to increase in fiscal year due to expected increased levels of reo activity 
income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes was million for the year ended march  compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended march  the benefit for income taxes was a result of the net pre tax loss incurred for the year ended march  the effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared to for fiscal year when the company incurs a pre tax loss  its effective tax rate is higher than the statutory tax rate primarily as a result of non taxable income generated from investments in bank owned life insurance and tax exempt municipal bonds 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  for further discussion of the company s income taxes 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net income 
net income was million  or per diluted share for the year ended march   compared to million  or per diluted share for the year ended march  the decrease was primarily due to a combination of decreased net interest income and an increase in the provision for loan losses 
net interest income 
net interest income for fiscal year was million  representing a million  or a decrease  from million in fiscal year the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year interest income 
interest income was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  decreased interest income was the result of federal reserve rate cuts 
average interest bearing assets increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal year the yield on interest earning assets was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  totaled million  a  or increase from million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in interest expense is the result of higher rates of interest paid on deposits and borrowings that occurred during the first half of fiscal year the weighted average interest rate of total deposits increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the weighted average interest rate of fhlb borrowings decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  due to the falling interest rate environment  the mix of deposits shifted into certificates of deposit 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was the result of increased loan growth  changes in the loan loss rates and a negative trend in the risk rating migration of certain loans 
the risk rating migration largely consisted of land acquisition and development loans and residential construction loans being moved to higher risk rating categories 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses and unfunded loan commitments to total net loans was at march   compared to at march  net charge offs for the year ended march  were  compared to net recoveries of  for the same period last year 
the increase in net charge offs was primarily attributable to the charge off of three commercial loans totaling  for the year ended march  annualized net charge offs to average net loans for the year ended march  were  compared to for the same period in the prior year 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased  to million for the year ended march  from million for the same period in decreases in mortgage broker loan fees that are reported in fees and service charges were partially offset by an increase in asset management fees 
for the year ended march   broker loan fees decreased by  compared to the year ended march  the increase in asset management fees of  for the year ended march  compared to the same prior year period reflected the increase in assets under management by ramcorp 
from million at march  to million at march  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year ended march  compared to million for fiscal year ended march  the principal component of the increase in the company s non interest expense was salaries and employee benefits 
for the year ended march   salaries and employee benefits  which includes mortgage broker commission compensation  was million  an increase over the prior year total of million 
salaries increased as the number of full time equivalent employees increased to at march  from at march   which was primarily the result of the expansion of the company s lending team and the opening of a new branch and separate lending office

the company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity increases by retaining portfolio loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and selling fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans with terms to maturity of more than years 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms up to ten years 
the company has adopted a strategy that is designed to maintain or improve the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities 
the primary elements of this strategy involve the origination of adjustable rate loans  increasing commercial  consumer loans that are adjustable rate and short term loans and residential construction loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one to four family residential mortgage loans  matching asset and liability maturities  investing in short term securities  and the origination of fixed rate loans for sale in the secondary market and the retention of the related loan servicing rights 
the strategy for liabilities has been to shorten the maturities for both deposits and borrowings 
this approach has remained consistent throughout the past year  as the company has experienced a change in the mix of loans  deposits  frb advances and fhlb advances 
the company s mortgage servicing activities provide additional protection from interest rate risk 
the company retains servicing rights on all mortgage loans sold 
as market interest rates rise  the fixed rate loans held in portfolio diminish in value 
however  the value of the servicing portfolio tends to rise as market interest rates increase because borrowers tend not to prepay the underlying mortgages  thus providing an interest rate risk hedge versus the fixed rate loan portfolio 
the mortgage loan servicing portfolio totaled million at march  the average balance of the servicing portfolio was million and produced loan servicing income of  for the year ended march  see item business lending activities mortgage loan servicing 
consumer loans  such as home equity lines of credit and installment loans  commercial and construction loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans  and accordingly reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
adjustable interest rate loans totaled million or of total loans at march  as compared to million or at march  although the company has sought to originate adjustable rate loans  the ability to originate and purchase such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
particularly in lower interest rate environments  borrowers often prefer to obtain fixed rate loans

the company also invests in short term to medium term us government securities as well as mortgage backed securities issued or guaranteed by us government agencies

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is essential to our business 
the objective of the bank s liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals  fund the borrowing needs of loan customers  and to fund ongoing operations 
core relationship deposits are the primary source of the bank s liquidity 
as such  the bank focuses on deposit relationships with local consumer and business clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the bank 
with the significant downturn in economic conditions our customers in general have experienced reduced funds available to deposit in the bank 
despite these difficult economic conditions  our customer relationship deposit balances increased million over fiscal year  including an increase in non interest bearing demand deposits of approximately million 
overall  total deposits were million at march  compared to million at march  however  the growth in our loan portfolio surpassed the growth in our deposit accounts  as a result  the company has increased its use of secured borrowings from fhlb and frb 
in response to the adverse economic conditions  the company has been  and will continue to work toward reducing the amount of nonperforming assets  adjusting the balance sheet by reducing loan totals and other assets as possible  reducing controllable operating costs  and augmenting deposits while striving to maximize secured borrowing facilities to improve liquidity and preserve capital over the coming fiscal year 
however  the company s inability to successfully implement its plans or further deterioration in economic conditions and real estate prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
liquidity management is both a short and long term responsibility of the company s management 
the company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of i expected loan demand  ii projected loan sales  iii expected deposit flows  iv yields available on interest bearing deposits and v its asset liability management program objectives 
excess liquidity is invested generally in interest bearing overnight deposits and other short term government and agency obligations 
if the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  it has additional diversified and reliable sources of funds with the fhlb  the frb  pacific coast banker s bank and other wholesale facilities 
these sources of funds may be used on a long or short term basis to compensate for reduction in other sources of funds or on a long term basis to support lending activities 
the company s primary source of funds are customer deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  the sale of loans  maturing securities and fhlb and frb advances 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and prepayment of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
management believes that its focus on core relationship deposits coupled with access to borrowing through reliable counterparties provides reasonable and prudent assurance that ample liquidity is available 
however  depositor or counterparty behavior could change in response to competition  economic or market situations or other unforeseen circumstances  which could have liquidity implications that may require different strategic or operational actions 
the company must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds in order to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  satisfy other financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
we generally maintain cash and readily marketable securities to meet a portion of our short term liquidity needs  however  our primary liquidity management practice is to increase or decrease short term borrowings  including fhlb advances and frb borrowings 
at march   advances from fhlb totaled million and the bank had additional borrowing capacity available of million from the fhlb  subject to sufficient collateral and stock investment 
at march   advances from the frb totaled million and the bank had additional borrowing capacity of million from the frb  subject to sufficient collateral 
borrowing capacity from fhlb or frb may fluctuate based on acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion 
the bank also has a million fed funds line with pacific coast banker s bank at march  the bank had no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement at march  an additional source of wholesale funding includes brokered certificate of deposits 
the company has historically not relied on brokered deposits to fund its operations 
at march   the company had million in brokered deposits representing of total deposits  compared to million at march   exclusive of cdars deposits 
the bank participates in the cdars product  which allows the bank to accept deposits in excess of the fdic insurance limits for that depositor and obtain pass through insurance for the total deposit 
the bank s cdars balance was million at march  with news of bank failures and increased levels of distress in the financial services industry and growing customer concern with fdic insurance limits  customer interest in and demand for cdars deposits increased before leveling off in the fourth quarter 
in april  the ots informed the bank that it was placing a restriction on the bank s ability to increase wholesale brokered deposits  including cdars deposits 
as of the end of april  the bank paid down its brokered deposits to zero and had cdars deposits of million 
there can be no assurance that cdars deposits will be available for the company to offer its customers in the future 
the combination of all the bank s funding sources  gives the bank available liquidity of million  or of total assets at march  under the tlgp  all noninterest bearing transaction accounts  iolta accounts  and certain now accounts are fully guaranteed by the fdic for the entire amount in the account 
the bank has elected to participate in this program at an additional cost to the bank 
other deposits maintained at the bank are also insured by the fdic up to  per account owner through december  at march   the company had commitments to extend credit of million 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from march  totaled million 
historically  the company has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature 
offsetting these cash outflows are scheduled loan maturities of less than one year totaling million at march  sources of capital and liquidity for the company include distributions from the bank and the issuance of debt or equity securities 
dividends and other capital distributions from the bank arise from the cash flow and earnings of the bank  which distributions are subject to regulatory restriction and approval 
to the extent the bank cannot pay dividends to the company  the company may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends to its stockholders or may be forced to defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures  which in turn  may restrict the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock 
ots regulations require the bank to maintain specific amounts of regulatory capital 
for a detailed discussion of regulatory capital requirements  see regulation federal regulation of savings associations capital requirements and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in this regard  as part of our strategic planning  we are currently considering raising additional capital 
we anticipate that this capital will be raised through non government sources for the purpose of increasing our capital position and achieving compliance with the additional capital requirements contained in the mou 
we have not decided on the type of securities we will issue but it may include common stock  preferred stock  warrants or a combination of these obligations 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

the bank has entered into employment contracts with certain key employees  which provide for contingent payment subject to future events 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage  commercial and consumer loans 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the company s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
commitments to originate loans are conditional  and are honored for up to days subject to the company s usual terms and conditions 
collateral is not required to support commitments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does it engage in hedging activities or purchase high risk derivative instruments

qualitative aspects of market risk 
the company s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while limiting its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the company intends to reduce risk where appropriate but accepts a degree of risk when warranted by economic circumstances 
the company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets by retaining in its portfolio  short term loans and loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustments 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms up to ten years 
consumer and commercial loans are originated and held in portfolio as the short term nature of these portfolio loans match durations more closely with the short term nature of retail deposits such as interest checking  money market accounts and savings accounts 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with longer terms to maturity 
except for immediate short term cash needs  and depending on the current interest rate environment  fhlb advances will have maturities of long or short term 
frb advances have short term maturities 
for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein 
a number of measures are utilized to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including simulation modeling and traditional interest rate gap analysis 
while both methods provide an indication of risk for a given change in interest rates  the simulation model is primarily used to assess the impact on earning changes in interest rates may produce 
key assumptions in the model include cash flows and maturities of financial instruments  changes in market conditions  loan volumes and pricing  deposit sensitivity  consumer preferences and management s capital leverage plans 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may significantly differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and specific strategies among other factors 
the following tables show the approximate percentage change in net interest income as of march  over a month period under several rate scenarios 
change in interest rates percent change in net interest income months percent change in net interest income months up basis points base case down basis points our balance sheet continues to be slightly asset sensitive  meaning that interest earning assets reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a given period 
however  due to a number of loans in our loan portfolio with interest rate floors  our net interest income will be negatively impacted in a rising interest rate environment until such time as the current rate exceeds these interest rate floors 
conversely  in a falling interest rate environment these interest rate floors will assist in maintaining our net interest income 
we attempt to limit our interest rate risk through managing the repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
furthermore  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at march  market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments
