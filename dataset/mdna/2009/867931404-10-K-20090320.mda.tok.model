item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes many forward looking statements 
for cautions about relying on such forward looking statements  please refer to the section entitled forward looking statements at the beginning of this report immediately prior to item general we are a leading company in high temperature superconductor hts materials and related technologies 
hts materials have the unique ability to conduct various signals or energy eg  electrical current or radio frequency rf signals with little or no resistance when cooled to critical temperatures 
electric currents that flow through conventional conductors encounter resistance that requires power to overcome and generates heat 
hts materials can substantially improve the performance characteristics of electrical systems  reducing power loss  lowering heat generation and decreasing electrical noise 
circuits designed to remove interference inherent in some rf signals can also be made from hts materials 
commercial use of hts materials requires a number of cutting edge technologies  including development of hts materials  specialized manufacturing expertise to create uniform thin layers of these materials  expert designs of circuits optimized for hts materials  and technologies to maintain an extremely low temperature environment for hts applications although the critical temperatures for hts are high compared with traditional superconductors  they are still extremely cold by other standards 
our proprietary technology we are focused on research and development to maintain our technological edge 
as of december   we had employees in our research and development division  eight of our employees have phds  and others hold advanced degrees in physics  materials science  electrical engineering and other fields 
our development efforts over the last years have yielded an extensive patent portfolio as well as critical trade secrets  unpatented technology and proprietary knowledge 
we enter into confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with our employees  suppliers and consultants to protect our proprietary information 
as of december   we held us patents in the following categories patents for technologies directed toward producing thin film materials and structures  which expire between and we have developed a proprietary state of the art manufacturing process for producing hts thin films of the highest quality 
patents for cryogenic and non microwave circuit designs  which expire between and the expertise of our highly qualified team has allowed us to design and fabricate extremely small  high performance circuits including rf signal filters 
patents covering cryogenics  packaging and systems  which expire between and our proprietary and patented cryogenic packaging innovation provides us with a significant competitive advantage in maintaining our hts materials at their critical temperatures 
patents covering other superconducting technologies  which expire between and as of december   we also had issued foreign patents  us patent applications pending and foreign applications patents pending 
we are currently focusing our efforts on applications in areas such as wireless networks 
our current commercial products help maximize the performance of wireless telecommunications networks by improving the quality of uplink signals from mobile wireless devices 
our products increase capacity utilization  lower dropped and blocked calls  extend coverage  and enable higher wireless data throughput all while reducing capital and operating costs 
reconfigurable handset filters 
the trend in the wireless handset industry is to continually reduce size and cost  while adding more features and making the unit more adaptable to different air interfaces and frequencies throughout the world 
this drives the need for more complex and reconfigurable transceivers 
we believe our strong intellectual property and expertise in frequency agile and thin film filters position us well to meet this demand 
superconducting power transmission lines 
we have entered into a collaborative effort and signed a material transfer agreement with the department of energy s los alamos national laboratory lanl to apply our 
table of contents hts expertise to lanl s research initiative to develop hts coated conductors for power transmission lines 
if successfully developed  hts superconducting cables could replace copper power transmission lines  resulting in higher capacity with less resistive cable losses 
government products 
as the worldwide leader in developing tunable hts filter systems for military applications  we continue to be a crucial partner in the us government s future success 
our high performance hts filter systems have been proven to increase the detection range  reduce interference  and in some cases  detect signals that were previously undetectable with conventional technology 
currently  we actively participate in the development of technologies for application in military communications  signals intelligence  and electronic warfare 
our development efforts can take a significant number of years to commercialize  and we must overcome significant technical barriers and deal with other significant risks  some of which are set out in our public filings  including in particular the risk factors included in item a of this report 
our business model to be successful  we must use our expertise and our technology to generate revenues in various ways  including government contracts  commercial operations  joint ventures and licenses government contracts we generate significant revenues from government contracts 
we typically own the intellectual property developed under these contracts  and grant the federal government a royalty free  non exclusive and nontransferable license to use it 
as a result  our government contracts can not only generate a profit for us  but we can also make additional money through exploiting of the resulting technology in our commercial operations as well as government products  or through licenses or joint ventures 
contracts with the us government contain provisions  and are subject to laws and regulations  that give the government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts  including rights that allow the government to terminate existing contracts for convenience  which affords the us government the right to terminate the contract in whole or in part anytime it wants for any reason or no reason  as well as for default  reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts  if its requirements or budgetary constraints change  cancel or reduce multi year contracts and related orders  if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable  adjust reimbursable contract costs and fees on the basis of audits completed by its agencies through exercise of its oversight rights  and control or prohibit the export of products 

table of contents compensation in the event of a termination  if any  is limited to compensation for work completed at the time of termination 
in the event of termination for convenience  we may receive a certain allowance for profit on the work performed 
commercial applications we have chosen to manufacture and sell certain commercial products on our own 
to date  our commercial efforts have been focused on the design  manufacture  and sale of high performance infrastructure products for wireless voice and data applications 
we have three current product lines  all of which relate to wireless base stations superlink  a highly compact and reliable receiver front end hts wireless filter system to eliminate out of band interference for wireless base stations  combining filters with a proprietary cryogenic cooler and a cooled low noise amplifier 
amplink  a ground mounted unit for wireless base stations that includes a high performance amplifier and up to six dual duplexers 
superplex  a high performance multiplexer that provides extremely low insertion loss and excellent cross band isolation designed to eliminate the need for additional base station antennas and reduce infrastructure costs 
we sell most of our current commercial products to a small number of wireless carriers in the united states  including alltel  at t  sprint nextel  t mobile and verizon wireless 
verizon wireless and at t each accounted for more than of our commercial revenues in and we are seeking to expand our customer base by selling directly to other wireless network operators and manufacturers of base station equipment  including internationally 
demand for wireless communications equipment fluctuates dramatically and unpredictably 
the wireless communications infrastructure equipment market is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence  evolving industry standards and price erosion over the life of a product 
we face constant pressures to reduce prices 
consequently  we expect the average selling prices of our products will continue decreasing over time 
we expect these trends to continue and may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenues 
our commercial operations are subject to a number of significant risks  some of which are set out in our public filings  including in particular the risk factors included in item a of this report 
joint ventures from time to time we may pursue joint ventures with other entities to commercialize our technology 
in particular  we have agreed to license certain technology for our superlink interference elimination solution for the china market to a joint venture where we own percent of the equity 
in the first quarter of  we received orders from the joint venture for our new td scdma solution to perform lab trial and field trial activities in china 
the lab trial was successfully completed in the second quarter of  and the field trial was successfully completed during the fourth quarter of the commencement of manufacturing and the transfer of our processes to the joint venture will be driven by product demand from the china market 
the joint venture s activities remain subject to successful product marketing efforts in addition to a number of other conditions  including certain critical approvals from the chinese and united states governments 
in particular  we have been in discussions with the united states government concerning the national security implications of our joint venture and investment from baoli 
there continues to be no assurance that these conditions will be met  or that all required approvals if obtained will be obtained on a timely basis 
even if these conditions are met and the approvals received  the results from our joint venture will be subject to a number of significant risks associated with international operations and new ventures  some of which are set forth in our public filings  including in particular the risk factors included in item a of this report 
licenses from time to time we grant licenses for our technology to other companies 
specifically  we have granted licenses to  among others  bruker for nuclear magnetic resonance application  general dynamics for government applications and star cryoelectronics for superconducting quantum interference device applications 

table of contents recent developments operating lease in february  we amended our office and production facilities lease 
the base rent and the minimum annual escalation clause were reduced  and the term of the lease was extended five years to november contract funding in march  the second phase of our us air force contract was funded for an additional twelve months and provides for progress billing of up to million 
backlog our commercial backlog consists of accepted product purchase orders with scheduled delivery dates during the next twelve months 
we had commercial backlog of  at december   as compared to  at december  results of operations compared to net revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in net revenues consist primarily of commercial product revenues and government contract revenues 
we also generate some additional revenues from sublicensing our technology 
net commercial product revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is primarily the result of lower sales volume for our products 
average sales prices for our products were essentially unchanged in our two largest customers accounted for of our net commercial revenues in  as compared to in these customers generally purchase products through non binding commitments with minimal lead times 
consequently  our commercial product revenues can fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter based on changes in our customers capital spending patterns 
government contract revenues decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the completion of the first phase of a major contract and a funding gap before the second phase of that contract was funded 
cost of commercial product revenues includes all direct costs  manufacturing overhead and provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
the cost of commercial product revenues totaled million for as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
the lower costs resulted principally from lower production as a result of lower sales 
our expense provision for obsolete inventories totaled  in as compared to  in our cost of sales includes both variable and fixed cost components 
the variable component consists primarily of materials  assembly and test labor  overhead  which includes equipment and facility depreciation  transportation costs and warranty costs 
the fixed component includes test equipment and facility depreciation  purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs 
given the fixed nature of such costs  the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales increases as production volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against 
conversely  the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases as production volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against 
as a result  our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and production volumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales  and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and production volumes increase due to higher sales volume and lower amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales 
our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the 
table of contents inventory 
we review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record  on a quarterly basis  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments 
if the results of the review determine that a write down is necessary  we recognizes a loss in the period in which the loss is identified  whether or not the inventory is retained 
the following is an analysis of our commercial product gross profit margins for and years ended december  dollars in thousands net commercial product sales cost of commercial product sales gross profit we had a negative gross margin of million in from the sale of our commercial products as compared to a negative gross margin of  in the negative gross margin in is primarily because the reduced level of commercial sales was insufficient to cover our fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
our gross margins were also adversely impacted by a  charge for excess and obsolete inventory in and a similar charge of  in gross margins were favorably impacted by  in by the sale of previously written off inventory 
there was no similar benefit in we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and provide an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory based on numerous factors  including sales backlog  historical inventory usage  forecasted product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
contract research and development expenses totaled million in as compared to million in  an increase of  or 
as a percentage of government revenue  contract research and development expenses increased from in to in because of different cost recognition criteria on one of our cost plus contracts 
other research and development expenses relate to development of new wireless commercial products and other products related to our expertise 
we also incur design expenses associated with reducing the cost and improving the manufacturability of our existing products 
these expenses totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of  or 
the increase is due to increased efforts associated with new commercial products development 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in as compared to million in  an increase of  or less than 
expenses were lower in primarily from reversal of a  reserve in the first quarter of in we had lower insurance premiums and lower selling expenses that were slightly offset by higher legal expenses associated with our china joint venture 
in the fourth quarter of we reduced our work force and incurred a  severance charge 
there was no similar charge in interest income increased to  in  as compared to  in  primarily because of higher cash balances in interest expense in amounted to  as compared to  in  as a result of lower borrowing levels 
our loss totaled million in  as compared to million in the net loss available to common stockholders totaled per common share in  as compared to per common share in compared to net revenues decreased by million  or  from million in to million in 
table of contents net commercial product revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is primarily the result of lower sales volume for some or our products 
average sales prices for our products decreased only slightly in our two largest customers accounted for of our net commercial revenues in  as compared to in these customers generally purchase products through non binding commitments with minimal lead times 
consequently  our commercial product revenues can fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter based on changes in our customers capital spending patterns 
government contract revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of new or amended contracts in the cost of commercial product revenues totaled million for as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
the lower costs resulted principally from lower production as a result of lower sales 
in addition  with lower production  we had fewer units to absorb our fixed overhead costs 
our provision for obsolete inventories decreased to  in as compared to  in the following is an analysis of our commercial product gross profit margins for and years ended december  dollars in thousands net commercial product sales cost of commercial product sales gross profit we had a negative gross margin of  in from the sale of our commercial products as compared to a positive gross margin of million in we experienced negative gross profits in primarily because the reduced level of commercial sales was insufficient to cover our fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
our gross margins were also adversely impacted by a  charge for excess and obsolete inventory 
gross margins were favorably impacted by  in and  in by the sale of previously written off inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and provide an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory based on numerous factors  including sales backlog  historical inventory usage  forecasted product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
contract research and development expenses totaled million in as compared to million in  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily the result of higher expenses associated with performing a greater number of government contracts 
as a percentage of government contract revenues  contract research and development expenses was in and in other research and development expenses relate to development of new wireless commercial products 
we also incur design expenses associated with reducing the cost and improving the manufacturability of our existing products 
these expenses totaled million in as compared to million in  a decrease of  or 
the decrease is due to lower expenses associated with commercial products development and the result of our cost reduction efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the lower expenses resulted primarily from  received from a settlement agreement with a former director and lower insurance premiums 
in connection with the acquisition of conductus in december we recognized million of goodwill 
at july   we concluded that our declining stock price constituted an event under fas and required us to test for goodwill impairment 
our analysis led us to reasonably estimate at that time that our fair market value was less than our net assets excluding goodwill 
accordingly  we recorded a full write down of the goodwill million in the second quarter of we also recorded an impairment charge of  related to a note receivable from a board member in interest income decreased to  in  as compared to  in  primarily because of lower cash balances in 
table of contents interest expense in amounted to  as compared to  in  as a result of lower borrowing levels 
our loss totaled million in as compared to million in the net loss available to common stockholders totaled per common share in  as compared to per common share in liquidity and capital resources cash flow analysis as of december   we had working capital of million  including million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to working capital of million at december   which included million in cash and cash equivalents 
we currently invest our excess cash in short term  investment grade  money market instruments with maturities of three months or less 
our investments have no exposure to the auction rate securities market 
we believe that all of our cash investments would be readily available to us should the need arise 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million from million at december  to million at december  cash was used principally in operations and to a lesser extent for our joint venture and the purchase of property and equipment 
these uses were offset by gross cash proceeds of million provided by the sales of common and preferred stock 
cash used in operations totaled million in we used million to fund the cash portion of our net loss 
we also used cash to fund a million increase in inventory  accounts payable payments  patents and licenses payments and prepaid and other current asset payments 
these uses were offset by cash generated from lower accounts receivable and other assets totaling million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled  in we invested  in our joint venture and we purchased  in fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in the cash was provided by million  net of  in expenses  from the final payments under the million august baoli investment and million  net of  in expenses  from the sale of  shares of common stock at per share in may net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in financing activities we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash on hand  equipment lease financings  available borrowings under bank lines of credit and both private and public equity offerings 
we have effective registration statements on file with the securities and exchange commission covering the public resale by investors of common stock issued in our private placements  as well as common stock acquired upon exercise of warrants 
as described above  we completed two financing activities in totaling million the balance of the million baoli investment and a million offering of common stock in may in  we did not complete a financing transaction 
however  in  we received million from baoli as an installment toward completion of a million financing completed in february we have an existing line of credit from a bank 
the line of credit expires in july the loan agreement is structured as a sale of our accounts receivable and provides for the sale of up to million of eligible accounts receivable  with advances to us totaling of the receivables sold 
advances bear interest at the prime rate at december  plus subject to a minimum monthly charge 
advances are collateralized by a lien on all of our assets 
under the terms of the agreement  we continue to service the sold receivables and are subject to recourse provisions 
there was no amount outstanding under this borrowing facility at december  
table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments we incur various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in our normal course of business 
they consist of the following operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations consist of a facility lease in santa barbara  california and several copier leases 
patents and licenses we have entered into various licensing agreements requiring royalty payments ranging from to of specified product sales 
some of these agreements contain provisions for the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts 
typically  the licensor can terminate our license if we fail to pay minimum annual royalties 
purchase commitments in the normal course of business  we incur purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory  as well as other goods and services 
these obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders that contain the terms and conditions associated with the purchase arrangements 
we are committed to accept delivery of such material pursuant to the purchase orders subject to various contract provisions that allow us to delay receipt of such orders or cancel orders beyond certain agreed upon lead times 
cancellations may result in cancellation costs payable by us 
quantitative summary of contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period and and and contractual obligations total beyond operating leases minimum license commitment fixed asset and inventory purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations capital expenditures we plan to invest approximately  in fixed assets during future liquidity in  we incurred a net loss of million and had negative cash flows from operations of million 
in  we incurred a net loss of million and had negative cash flows from operations of million 
our independent registered public accounting firm has included in their audit reports for fiscal through an explanatory paragraph expressing doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
at december  we had million in cash 
our cash resources  together with our line of credit  and a planned inventory reduction  may not be sufficient to fund our business through we believe one of the key factors to our liquidity will be our ability to successfully execute on our plans to increase sales levels in a highly concentrated industry where we experience significant fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter 
our cash requirements will also depend on 
table of contents numerous other variable factors  including the rate of growth of sales  the timing and levels of products purchased  payment terms and credit limits from manufacturers  and the timing and level of accounts receivable collections 
because of the uncertainty of these many factors  we may need to raise funds in the next six months to meet our working capital needs 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we issue additional equity securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if we cannot raise any needed funds  we might be forced to make further substantial reductions in our operating expenses  which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company 
net operating loss carryforward as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in the years through of these amounts  million and million  respectively  resulted from the acquisition of conductus 
included in the net operating loss carryforwards are deductions related to stock options of approximately million and million for federal and california income tax purposes  respectively 
to the extent net operating loss carryforwards are recognized for accounting purposes  the resulting benefits related to the stock options will be credited to stockholders equity 
in addition  we had research and development and other tax credits for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in the years through of these amounts   and  respectively  resulted from the acquisition of conductus 
due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset has been recorded in the accompanying balance sheet 
section of the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards based on a statutory rate of return usually the applicable federal funds rate  as defined in the internal revenue code and the value of the corporation at the time of a change of ownership as defined by section we had changes in ownership in august and december in addition  we acquired the right to conductus net operating losses  which are also subject to the limitations imposed by section conductus underwent three ownership changes  which occurred in february  february and december therefore  the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards of million and conductus net operating loss carryforwards of million incurred prior to the ownership changes will be subject in future periods to annual limitations of million and  respectively 
net operating losses incurred by us subsequent to the ownership changes totaled million and are not subject to this limitation 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculation purposes 
our money market investments have no exposure to the auction rate securities market 
at december   we had approximately million invested in a money market account yielding approximately 
assuming a per annum decrease in the yield on this money market account and no liquidation of principal for the year  our total interest income would decrease by approximately  per annum 
as we had no amounts outstanding on our bank loan during  changes in its interest rate would not have affected us 
inflation we do not foresee any material impact on our operations from inflation 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  recovery of long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contract revenue and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record  on a quarterly basis  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments 
if the results of the review determine that a write down is necessary  we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified  whether or not the inventory is retained 
our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory 
such provisions are established based on historical usage  adjusted for known changes in demands for such products  or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
our business is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
our net sales consist of revenue from sales of products  net of trade discounts and allowances 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the time revenue is recognized  we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties if allowed for under contractual arrangements and return products 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should such failure rates or costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted 
we indemnify  without limit or term  our customers against all claims  suits  demands  damages  liabilities  expenses  judgments  settlements and penalties arising from actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property relating to our products or other claims arising from our products 
we cannot reasonably develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of payments that might be made under our guarantees because of the uncertainty as to whether a claim might arise and how much it might total 
contract revenues are principally generated under research and development contracts 
contract revenues are recognized utilizing the percentage of completion method measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
if the current contract estimate were to indicate a loss  utilizing the funded amount of the contract  a provision would be made for the total anticipated loss 
contract revenues are derived primarily from research contracts with agencies of the united states government 
credit risk related to accounts receivable arising from such contracts is considered minimal 
these contracts include cost plus  fixed price and cost sharing arrangements and are generally short term in nature 
all payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to adjustment upon audit by the defense contract audit agency 
based on historical experience and review of current projects in process  
table of contents we believe that the audits will not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the defense contract audit agency has audited us through we periodically evaluate the realizability of long lived assets as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount 
long lived assets that will no longer be used in our business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for us 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including cash flow and profitability projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
in the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value of the assets  the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
our future cash flows may vary from estimates 
we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes the accounting for stock based awards 
under this method  stock based employee compensation cost is recognized using the fair value based method for all awards granted on or after the beginning of fiscal year we issue stock option awards and restricted share awards to employees and to non employee directors under our stock based incentive plans 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
compensation cost related to restricted share awards is recorded based on the market price of our common stock on the grant date 
we recognize compensation expense over the expected vesting period on a straight line basis from the grant date 
our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is based on our assessments of historical losses and projected operating results in future periods 
if and when we generate future taxable income in the us against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years 
we have a contract to deliver several custom products to a government contractor  with respect to which delivery of the product was delayed because we were unable to manufacture the products for technical reasons 
in december  new terms and amended specifications were agreed upon  and we now expect to deliver these custom products in july item a
