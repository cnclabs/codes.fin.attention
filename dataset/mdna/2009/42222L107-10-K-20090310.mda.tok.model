item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of about us that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this document are forward looking statements 
although we believe that in making such statements our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  such statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  or that include words such as will  would  should  plans  likely  expects  anticipates  intends  believes  estimates  thinks  may  and similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
the following important factors  in addition to those discussed under risk factors under part i  item  could affect the future results of the health care industry in general  and us in particular  and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
uncertainties in our establishing or maintaining relationships with physicians and hospitals  the impact of current and future laws and governmental regulations  uncertainties inherent in third party payors attempts to limit health care coverages and levels of reimbursement  the effects of competition and technological changes  the availability or lack thereof of acquisition or combination opportunities  and general economic  market or business conditions 
general we provide healthcare services and medical devices  primarily to the urology marketplace 
we have two reportable segments urology services and medical products 
prior to july   we also designed and manufactured trailers and coaches that transport high technology medical devices and equipment for mobile command and control centers and the media and broadcast industry 
urology services 
our lithotripsy services are provided principally through limited partnerships and other entities that we manage  which use lithotripsy devices 
in  physicians who are affiliated with us used our lithotripters to perform approximately  procedures in the us we do not render any medical services 
rather  the physicians do 
we have two types of contracts  retail and wholesale  that we enter into in providing our lithotripsy services 
retail contracts are contracts where we contract with the hospital and private insurance payors 
wholesale contracts are contracts where we contract only with the hospital 
the two approaches functionally differ in that  under a retail contract  we generally bill for the entire non physician fee for all patients other than governmental pay patients  for which the hospital bills the non physician fee 
under a wholesale contract  the hospital generally bills for the entire non physician fee for all patients 
in both cases  the billing party contractually bears the costs associated with the billing service  including pre certification  as well as non collection 
the non billing party is generally entitled to its fees regardless of whether the billing party actually collects the non physician fee 
accordingly  under the wholesale contracts where we are the non billing party  the hospital generally receives a greater proportion of the total non physician fee to compensate for its billing costs and collection risk 
conversely  under the retail contracts where we generally provide the billing services and bear the collection risk  we receive a greater portion of the total non physician fee 
although the non physician fee under both retail and wholesale contracts varies widely based on geographical markets and the identity of the third party payor  we estimate that nationally  on average  our share of the non physician fee was roughly  respectively  for both and at this time  we do not anticipate a material shift between our retail and wholesale arrangements  or a material change in our share of the non physician fee 
as the general partner of limited partnerships or the manager of other types of entities  we also provide services relating to operating our lithotripters  including scheduling  staffing  training  quality assurance  regulatory compliance  and contracting with payors  hospitals and surgery centers 
also in the urology segment  we provide treatments for benign and cancerous conditions of the prostate 
in treating benign prostate disease  we deploy three technologies photo selective vaporization of the prostate pvp  trans urethral needle ablation tuna  and trans urethral microwave therapy tumt in certain partnerships 
all three technologies apply an energy source which reduces the size of the prostate gland 
in september  we completed the sale of our rocky mountain prostate business  which represented almost our entire tumt treatment operations 
for treating prostate and other cancers  we use a procedure called cryosurgery  a process which uses a double freeze thaw cycle to destroy cancers cells 
in april  we acquired ampi  which significantly expanded our cryosurgery partnership base 
our prostate treatment services are also provided principally through limited partnerships and other entities that we manage  which use equipment to perform the treatments 
benign prostate disease and cryosurgery cancer treatment services are billed in the same manner as our lithotripsy services under either retail or wholesale contracts 
we also provide services relating to operating the equipment  including scheduling  training  quality assurance  regulatory compliance and contracting 
we also provide image guided radiation therapy igrt technical services for cancer treatment centers 
our igrt technical services may relate to providing the technical non physician personnel to operate a physician practice group s igrt equipment  leasing igrt equipment to a physician practice group  providing services related to helping a physician practice group establish an igrt treatment center  or managing an igrt treatment center 
we recognize urology revenue primarily from the following sources fees for urology treatments 
a substantial majority of our urology revenue is derived from fees related to lithotripsy treatments performed using our lithotripters 
for lithotripsy and prostate treatment services  we  through our partnerships and other entities  facilitate the use of our equipment and provide other support services in connection with these treatments at hospitals and other health care facilities 
the professional fee payable to the physician performing the procedure is generally billed and collected by the physician 
we recognize revenue for these services when the services are provided 
igrt technical services are billed monthly and the related revenues are recognized as the related services are provided 
fees for managing the operation of our lithotripters and prostate treatment devices 
through our partnerships and otherwise directly by us  we provide services related to operating our lithotripters and prostate treatment equipment and receive a management fee for performing these services

in addition  in july  we acquired uropath llc  which managed pathology laboratories located at uropath sites for physician practice groups located in texas  florida and pennsylvania 
through uropath  we continue to manage in office pathology labs for practice groups and provide pathology services to physicians and practice groups with our lab equipment and personnel at our uropath laboratory sites 
fees for maintenance services 
we provide equipment maintenance services to our partnerships as well as outside parties

with respect to some lithotripter sales  in addition to the original sales price  we receive a licensing fee from the buyer of the lithotripter for each patient treated with such lithotripter 
in exchange for this licensing fee  we provide the buyer of the lithotripter with certain consumables 
all the sales for equipment and consumables are recognized when the related items are delivered 
revenues from licensing fees are recorded when the patient is treated

we continue to look at other strategic acquisition opportunities and believe conditions in the market favor our strong financial position  national platform of urologist relationships  and diversification within the urology services space 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets are both a critical accounting policy and estimate that require judgment and are based on assumptions of future operations 
we are required to test for impairments at least annually or if circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we test for impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter 
we now have two reporting units  urology services and medical products 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
because we have recognized goodwill based solely on our controlling interest  the fair value of each reporting unit also relates only to our controlling interest 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
both the income approach and the market approach require significant assumptions to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the significant assumptions used in the income approach include estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  operating plans  industry data and other relevant factors 
the significant assumptions utilized in the market approach include the determination of appropriate market comparables  the estimated multiples of revenue  ebit and ebitda a willing buyer is likely to pay  and the estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 
for a discussion of our and goodwill impairments and the specific assumptions used in the income and market approaches in the and analyses  see footnote c to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
a second critical accounting policy and estimate which requires judgment of management is the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments 
we have based our estimates on historical collection amounts  current contracts with payors  current changes of the facts and circumstances relating to these matters and certain negotiations with related payors 
a third critical accounting policy is consolidation of our investments in partnerships or limited liability companies llcs where we  as the general partner or managing member  exercise effective control  even though our ownership is less than 
the consolidated financial statements include our accounts  our wholly owned subsidiaries  and entities more than owned and limited partnerships or llcs where we  as the general partner or managing member  exercise effective control  even though our ownership is less than 
the related agreements provide us with broad powers 
the other parties do not participate in the management of the entity and do not have the substantial ability to remove us 
investment in entities in which our investment is less than ownership and we do not have significant control are accounted for by the equity method if ownership is between  or by the cost method if ownership is less than 
we have reviewed each of the underlying agreements and determined we have effective control  however  if it was determined this control did not exist  these investments would be reflected on the equity method of accounting 
although this would change individual line items within our consolidated financial statements  it would have no effect on our net income and or total stockholders equity 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our total revenues increased  as compared to revenues from our urology services segment increased  in as compared to revenues from our lithotripsy business increased  as compared to  while revenues from our prostate business increased  in as compared to revenues from our ampi acquisition  which was effective april   were the primary driver in the increased prostate revenues 
prostate revenues from ampi entities totaled million in the actual number of lithotripsy procedures performed in increased by compared to the average rate per procedure increased by in as compared to revenues for our medical products segment for increased  as compared to medical products revenues before intersegment eliminations totaled million for and million for we sold five lithotripters and one table in we sold eight lithotripters and tables during the same period in we discontinued the sale of tables in revenues from our claripath laboratory which commenced operations in january  totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues from our uropath acquisition  which was effective july   totaled  in our costs of services and general and administrative expenses for increased  compared to our cost of services associated with our urology services operations increased  in as compared to the primary cause of this increase relates to cost of services at our new ampi entities  whose costs totaled  in  partially offset by an overall decrease in cost of services of  attributed to our organic urology business 
this decrease in our organic business costs is primarily related to the write off of a certain payable at one of our partnerships in the first quarter of of approximately  which was recorded against operating expenses and  of insurance reimbursements received at one of our partnerships related to damages suffered during hurricane katrina 
our cost of services associated with our medical products operations for decreased  compared to this decrease is due to lower cost of sales on fewer device sales in the period  partially offset by approximately  in increased expenses at our claripath lab which has experienced significant growth year over year   in expenses at our new uropath labs  and approximately million in restructuring and moving costs related to moving our medical products operations from kennesaw  georgia to austin  texas 
a significant portion of medical products costs relate to providing maintenance services to our urology services segment and are allocated to the urology services segment 
in the future  we expect margins in medical products to continue to vary significantly from period to period based on the mix of intercompany and third party sales 
our selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  increased  compared to the same period in this increase primarily relates to increased compensation expenses of million related to restricted stock grants to employees which vested as performance goals were reached in the second and third quarters of and approximately million in increases in sales and marketing expenses associated with our claripath lab in in addition  we received approximately  as a result of our former swiss manufacturing subsidiary s insolvency proceedings in  which was recorded against selling  general and administrative expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test  we recorded an impairment to our urology services segment goodwill totaling million 
although our core operations remain stable and reflect growth over the prior year  we adjusted certain assumptions in our discounted cash flow model to address the recent declines in our market capitalization  which had fallen significantly below our consolidated net assets 
in addition  the market comparables component of our impairment test was negatively impacted by the current global economic crisis and global decline in the stock markets 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test  we recorded an impairment to our urology services segment goodwill totaling million 
this impairment was due to a decrease in our estimated future discounted cash flows for this segment 
this decrease was primarily caused by lower projected growth rates for our laser operations as well as the timing of certain future growth for our igrt operations 
in  we had a loss from discontinued operations of  attributable to our rmpt and hifu operations 
this loss included a gain of  from the sale of our rmpt business  which closed september depreciation and amortization expense increased  in compared to  primarily due to the addition of our new ampi entities and the amortization on our ocean services agreement 
minority interest in consolidated income for increased  compared to  as a result of increases in minority interest percentages at certain partnerships  combined with an increase in income at our existing urology partnerships and minority interest expense at our new ampi entities 
provision for income taxes in decreased  compared to due to the decrease in our taxable net income and the addition of a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets primarily as a result of the goodwill impairment recorded in the fourth quarter 
for the next several years  we will only be an alternative minimum tax payer as we will utilize our existing net operating loss carry forwards to offset any current taxes payable 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our total revenues decreased  as compared to revenues from our urology services decreased  as compared to revenues from our lithotripsy business decreased  in as compared to  while revenues from our prostate business increased  in as compared to the actual number of lithotripsy procedures performed in decreased by compared to  primarily due to partnership and mobile route closures in late and continued weak performance across our western region partnerships in early the average rate per procedure increased by in as compared to revenues for our medical products segment decreased by  compared to primarily due to less sales of our lithotripters and the discontinuation of sales of certain tables in early medical products revenues before intersegment eliminations totaled million for and million for we sold lithotripters and tables in compared to lithotripters and tables in revenues from our service operations and consumable sales decreased  in as compared to this decrease relates primarily to lower electrode sales especially as related to our foreign operations which we closed in revenues from our new laboratory which commenced operations in january  totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our costs of services and general and administrative expenses for decreased  compared to our cost of services associated with our urology services operations increased  in as compared with the cause of this increase relates primarily to increased rental expenses paid on revolix units leased from our medical products division of  and a decrease in gains resulting from sales of various partnership interests in as compared to of  which are recorded against operating expenses 
this was partially offset by lower laser supply costs of  which corresponds to more partnerships utilizing the revolix laser as compared to the greenlight laser 
our cost of services associated with our medical products operations for decreased  compared to the primary cause of this decrease relates to significant decreases in external sales of lithotripters and tables in  a cost reduction recorded as a result of the receipt of lease payments from our urology services division on revolix units noted above  partially offset by approximately  in increased expenses at our new lab 
a significant portion of medical products costs relate to providing maintenance services to our urology services segment and are allocated to the urology services segment 
in the future we expect margins in medical products to continue to vary significantly from period to period based on the mix of intercompany and third party sales 
our selling  general and administrative costs decreased  in as compared to this is primarily attributable to approximately  in costs paid to strategic consultants  million in severance payments   in higher share based compensation costs which were incurred in compared to  as well as approximately  in decreased personnel  insurance  marketing  recruiting and other costs 
in addition we received approximately  as a result of our former swiss manufacturing subsidiary s insolvency proceedings in  which was recorded against selling  general and administrative expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test  we recorded an impairment to our urology services segment goodwill totaling million 
this impairment was due to a decrease in our estimated future discounted cash flows for this segment 
this decrease was primarily caused by lower projected growth rates for our laser operations as well as the timing of certain future growth for our igrt operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment to our goodwill totaling million related to our urology services segment and million related to our medical products segment 
the impairment to our urology services segment was due primarily to a decrease in the number of overall procedures during  primarily across our western region partnerships  combined with the loss of certain partnerships and contracts late in to competitors 
the impairment in our medical products segment relates primarily to our decision to reduce or exit certain product lines  specifically patient management tables and orthopedic consumables during the fourth quarter of along with the closing of our european operations 
income from discontinued operations in decreased  compared to income from discontinued operations in included  attributable to our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment and  in losses attributable to our hifu  cryosurgery  and rocky mountain thermotherapy rmpt operations 
we recognized a gain  net of tax  totaling million in from the sale of our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment 
in  we had a loss from discontinued operations of  attributable to our rmpt and hifu operations 
this loss included a gain of  from the sale of our rmpt business  which closed september  depreciation and amortization expense decreased  in compared to minority interest in consolidated income for increased  compared to  as a result of increases in minority interest percentages at certain partnerships 
provision for income taxes in increased  compared to due to lower taxable loss in than liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash and cash equivalents were  and  at december  and  respectively 
while our subsidiaries generally distribute all of their available cash quarterly  after establishing reserves for estimated capital expenditures and working capital  these distributions are made just after quarter end which leads to an accumulated cash balance at the end of each quarter 
for the years ended december  and  our subsidiaries distributed cash of approximately  and  respectively  to minority interest holders 
in  we anticipate that our subsidiaries will begin making distributions on a monthly basis rather than a quarterly basis 
cash provided by our operations  after minority interest  was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  from to  fee and other revenue collected increased by  due primarily to increased revenues from our acquisitions 
cash paid to employees  suppliers of goods and others increased by  in this fluctuation is primarily attributable to increased operating expenses from our acquisitions and significant pay down of certain accrued expenses related to our ampi acquisition 
cash used by our investing activities for the year ended december   was  we utilized  in to acquire assets or interests in certain entities 
approximately million of that cash was used to acquire the ocean services contract  million was used to acquire ampi  and million to acquire uropath 
in addition we increased our interest in certain existing litho partnerships 
we purchased equipment and leasehold improvements totaling  in cash used by our investing activities for the year ended december   was  we used approximately million in cash to acquire our interests in the new keystone partnership and we used million to acquire increased ownership in two other partnerships

inventory as of december  totaled  and decreased  from december  senior credit facility our senior credit facility is comprised of a five year million revolving line of credit due march and a million senior secured term loan b due we entered into this senior credit facility in march and amended it in april and october the loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor to or prime 
to 
on july   we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment to repay the term loan b in full 
as of december   we have drawn million on the revolver 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  create liens  make investments  sell assets  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  make restricted payments  enter into transactions with affiliates  and make acquisitions 
in addition  our facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility as of december  on april   we amended our senior credit facility to increase the revolving line of credit from million to million  create an exception to the restricted payments negative covenant of the senior credit facility to enable us to repurchase up to million of our common stock  through a stock repurchase program or otherwise  increase the dollar amount of permitted acquisitions under the acquisitions negative covenant of the senior credit facility from million to million during any twelve month period beginning after april  and create an exception from the calculation of such permitted acquisitions basket for our acquisition of ampi 
on october   we amended our senior credit facility  to increase the dollar amount of permitted acquisitions under the acquisitions negative covenant from million to million during any twelve month period commencing on or after april  and prior to march  which dollar amount of permitted acquisitions will decrease back to million during any twelve month period commencing after march   provided that any such acquisitions will be subject to the prior written approval of the administrative agent under the senior credit facility 
other other long term debt 
as of december   we had notes totaling million related to equipment purchased by our limited partnerships 
these notes are paid from the cash flows of the related partnerships 
they bear interest at either a fixed rate ranging from four to nine percent or libor or prime plus a certain premium and are due over the next four years 
other long term obligations 
at december   as part of our acquisition of medstone international inc in february  we had an obligation totaling  related to payments to an employee for  a month continuing until february  as consideration for a noncompetition agreement 
we have an obligation totaling  related to payments of  a month until june  as consideration for a noncompetition agreement with a previous employee of our medical products division 
general the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt    operating leases     non compete contracts total      represents long term debt as discussed above 
represents operating leases in the ordinary course of our business 
represents an obligation of due to an employee of medstone  at a rate of per month continuing until february   and an obligation of due to a previous employee of ours  at a rate of per month until june  in addition  the scheduled principal repayments for all long term debt as of december  are payable as follows in thousands thereafter total  our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility which is due in march our cash flows from operations and therefore our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  our indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors discussed under risk factors under part i 
likewise  our ability to borrow under our senior credit facility will depend on these factors  which will affect our ability to comply with the covenants in our facility and our ability to obtain waivers for  or otherwise address  any noncompliance with the terms of our facility with our lenders 
we intend to increase our urology services operations primarily through forming new operating partnerships in new markets  expanding our igrt customer base and by acquisitions 
we seek opportunities to grow our medical products operations by expanding our anatomical pathology lab operations and acquisitions 
we intend to fund the purchase price for future acquisitions and developments using borrowings under our senior credit facility and cash flows from our operations 
in addition  we may use shares of our common stock in such acquisitions where we deem appropriate 
based upon the current level of our operations and anticipated cost savings and revenue growth  we believe that cash flows from our operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under our senior credit facility  will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs both for the short term and for at least the next several years 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations  that we will realize our anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements or that future borrowings will be available under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
inflation our operations are not significantly affected by inflation because we are not required to make large investments in fixed assets 
however  the rate of inflation will affect certain of our expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits
