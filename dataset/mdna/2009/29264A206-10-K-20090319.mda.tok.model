overview we design  manufacture and market radio frequency  or rf  modules that enable the transmission  reception and processing of high frequency signals in telecommunication network  defense electronics  homeland security and other systems 

table of contents markets and diversification strategy telecommunications market 
most of our rf modules are deployed in telecommunication networks  carrier class trunking networks and point to point transmission networks 
our target customers for these applications are telecommunication network original equipment manufacturers and systems integrators  collectively referred to in this report as telecom oems 
telecom oems provide the equipment used by service providers to deliver voice  data and video services to businesses and consumers 
telecom oems that purchased our products accounted for of our total revenues during and included nera asa and nokia siemens networks 
from to  we experienced a decrease of in our telecommunications related revenues 
this decline in revenues was due primarily to decreased demand  particularly during the fourth quarter of  from our telecommunications customers and lower average sales prices of our modules 
non telecommunication markets 
our rf modules are also designed into various applications outside of the telecommunication network market  including defense electronics  homeland security and other systems 
our target customers in the defense electronics market include defense systems integrators and their subcontractors that design aerospace systems  defense systems and weapons and electronics platforms for both domestic and foreign defense customers 
our target customers in the homeland security market include those utilizing the properties of high frequency rf energy to create new systems designed to detect and identify security threats 
we also sell modules to customers addressing other applications such as semiconductor testing 
in this report  we refer to our target customers in the defense electronics and homeland security markets as defense and homeland security systems integrators 
revenues from our customers in the defense electronics  homeland security and other systems markets include bae systems  l safeview inc  lockheed martin corporation and teradyne and accounted for of our total revenues in from to  we experienced growth of in our non telecommunication related revenues 
we continue to seek growth through enhancing our position as a leading merchant supplier of rf modules  continuing our expansion into the defense electronics  homeland security and other systems markets and pursuing strategic acquisitions 
current market outlook 
over the past several months  the global economic conditions have continued to deteriorate 
for example  credit has become severely restricted 
this restriction in credit has materially impacted our customers and vendors  which could have a negative effect on our business 
we expect the restriction in credit will continue to impact our customers and vendors for the foreseeable future 
the installation and enhancement of telecommunication networks integrating our products and the rollout of certain security and other systems  often rely on the availability of credit 
with the current restriction in credit markets  capital may not be available for the build out of these networks or systems 
without appropriate capital  our customers may have difficulty funding their on going operations and may reduce their orders for our products 
as a result  we currently estimate revenues for to be below revenues in in addition to a reduction in revenue  we have experienced a negative impact to our operations and financial results through an increase in our bad debt expense related to a note receivable  increased write offs of excess inventory and the write down of our goodwill and intangible assets 
we expect these risks to continue for the foreseeable future 
additionally  our vendors may rely on credit markets to finance their operations 
with the current restriction in credit markets  capital may not be available to our vendors or may only be available at unfavorable terms 
without appropriate capital  our vendors may have difficulty funding their on going operations and may not be able to fulfill orders for their products 
this could significantly impact our operations and financial results 
seasonality although we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in revenue at times over the past several years  we do not believe that volatility was primarily attributable to seasonality in our business 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  inventories  stock based compensation  income taxes  asset impairments and other commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved  below 
revenue recognition our primary customers are telecom oems  defense electronics  homeland security and other systems integrators that incorporate our products into their systems 
we recognize product revenues at the time title passes  which is generally upon product shipment or when withdrawn from a consignment location  coupled with persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues under development contracts are generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis  using project hours as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing revenues 
alternatively  where a development contract specifies defined progress gates or milestones tied to payments  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis matching the milestones 
revenues attributable to development fees accounted for of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in the costs incurred under these development agreements are included in research and development expenses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen 
we also consider our historical level of credit losses 
our reserves were  at december  and  at december  if actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our selling  general and administrative expenses would increase 
warranty reserves we generally offer a twelve to thirty month warranty on all of our products 
we record a liability based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and charge to cost of product revenues the amount of such costs at the time revenues are recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts 
at december  and our warranty reserves were million and million  respectively 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
if actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast  or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes review of materials usage  market conditions and product life cycles and an analysis of sales 
table of contents levels by product and projections of future demand and market conditions 
we adjust inventory balances to approximate the lower of our manufacturing cost or market value 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
this would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period 
at the time of write down  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period  related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of product revenues  resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period 
to the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins  we would disclose them 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
all of our stock compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and shares under our stock purchase plan using the black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
the fair value of each option grant and the shares under our stock purchase plan are estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model and the graded vesting method with assumptions concerning expected dividend yield  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life of the award 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
as our stock option awards have characteristics that differ significantly from traded options  and as changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  our estimate of fair value may not accurately represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
there currently is no market based mechanism to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates derived from the black scholes option valuation model or other allowable valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially affects our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 
deferred taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
we have recorded a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization of these assets based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 
long lived assets we periodically review our property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges 
significant assumptions and estimates include the projected cash flows based upon estimated revenues and expense growth rates  the estimated royalty rates used for the valuation of acquired tradenames  and the discount rate applied to expected cash flows 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our long lived assets for indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on reduced estimates of future revenues and future negative cash flow  we identified potential indicators of impairment 

table of contents as a result  we compared the fair value of our long lived assets to their carrying value 
based on our discounted future cash flow and revenue projections  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million for intangible assets with a defined useful life 
the impairment charges represent the excess of the carrying value of these assets over their fair value 
these impairment charges are not expected to result in any future cash expenditures 
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life we are required to assess the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life annually or whenever circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred 
based on the fair value of our common stock relative to our book value  revised estimates for our future revenues and the continued worsening of the global economy  we determined that indicators of potential impairment were present during the fourth quarter of as a result  we assessed the carrying value of acquired goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for impairment  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on the fair market value of the business and our discounted future cash flow and revenue projections  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million for goodwill and million for intangible assets with an indefinite life 
these impairment charges are not expected to result in any future cash expenditures 
fair value measurement on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements or sfas no 
which defines fair value  establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   except for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis  for which application has been deferred for one year 
our financial assets that require recognition under sfas no 
include certain cash equivalents and short term investments 
our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets level and less active markets level 
level instrument valuations are obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets 
level instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments 
as of december   we did not have any assets or liabilities without observable market values that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value level 
business combinations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between the intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the valuation of intangible assets is based on an income approach methodology that values the intangible assets based on the future cash flows that could potentially be generated by the asset over its estimated remaining life discounted to its present value utilizing an appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
as a result of business acquisitions  the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results
