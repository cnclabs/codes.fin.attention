our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the friday closest to september fiscal year was a week year and ended on october  fiscal year was a week year and ended on october  fiscal year was a week year and ended on september  business enterprise segments the company operates in one reportable segment 
as required by the segment reporting topics of the fasb asc sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  standards are established for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in their annual consolidated financial statements 
following the sale of the company s broadband access products bba operating segment  the results of which have been classified in discontinued operations  the company has one remaining operating segment  comprised of one reporting unit  which was identified based upon the availability of discrete financial information and the chief operating decision makers regular review of the financial information for this operating segment 
in august  we completed the sale of certain assets related to the bba business to ikanos communications  inc in august  we completed the sale of our bmp business to nxp 
as a result  the operations of the bmp business and the bba business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
results of operations net revenues we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the sales price and terms are fixed and determinable  and iv the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these terms are typically met upon shipment of product to the customer 
the majority of our distributors have limited stock rotation rights  which allow them to rotate up to of product in their inventory two times per year 
we recognize revenue to these distributors upon shipment of product to the distributor  as the stock rotation rights are limited and we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate and establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with fasb asc statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
revenue with respect to sales to customers to whom we have significant obligations after delivery is deferred until all significant obligations have been completed 
at october  and october   deferred revenue related to shipments of products for which we have on going performance obligations was million and million  respectively 
our net revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in average selling prices asps and a decrease in unit volume shipments 
the revenue decline was primarily driven by the economic downturn combined with the modem business de bundling trend and lower shipments of legacy wireless products 
the global economic recession severely dampened semiconductor industry sales in fiscal weakening demand for the major drivers of semiconductor sales  which includes automotive products  personal computers  
table of contents consumer electronics  and corporate information technology products  resulted in a sharp drop in semiconductor industry sales 
demand for all of our products has experienced significant decline in line with the industry decline 
revenues in the fiscal year ended october  were lower compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily as a result of the effects of the overall economic environment 
facing these challenges  the company has reduced its operating costs and managed its working capital  while continuing to focus on delivering innovative products to gain market share 
management believes it reached the bottom of its revenue cycle in the fiscal quarter ended april  and sees signs of market stabilization  evidenced by stronger quarter over quarter orders that support this belief 
our net revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decline was driven by a decrease in average selling prices asps which was offset slightly by a increase in unit volume shipments 
these declines were partially offset by approximately million of non recurring revenue from the buyout of a future royalty stream in fiscal gross margin gross margin represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we use third parties for wafer production and assembly and test services 
our cost of goods sold consists predominantly of purchased finished wafers  assembly and test services  royalties  other intellectual property costs  labor and overhead associated with product procurement and non cash stock based compensation charges for procurement personnel 
our gross margin percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal our gross margin percentage for fiscal includes a non recurring royalty buyout of million that occurred in the first quarter 
the royalty buyout contributed to our gross margin percentage during fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage is attributable to product cost reduction efforts and improved inventory management  resulting in lower excess and obsolete e o inventory provisions as a percentage of sales 
our gross margin percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal our gross margin percentage for fiscal includes a non recurring royalty buyout of million that occurred in the first quarter 
the royalty buyout contributed to our gross margin percentage during fiscal the remaining increase in gross margin percentage is attributable to product cost reduction efforts and favorable product mix 
we assess the recoverability of our inventories on a quarterly basis through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand  generally over the following twelve months 
foreseeable demand is based upon available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycle information 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
similarly  in the event that actual demand exceeds original projections  gross margins may be favorably impacted in future periods 
during fiscal  we recorded million of net credits for e o 
table of contents inventory 
during fiscal  we recorded million of net charges for e o inventory 
activity in our e o inventory reserves for fiscal and was as follows in thousands fiscal year ended e o reserves  beginning of period additions release upon sales of product scrap standards adjustments and other e o reserves  end of period we review our e o inventory balances at the product level on a quarterly basis and regularly evaluate the disposition of all e o inventory products 
it is possible that some of these reserved products will be sold  which will benefit our gross margin in the period sold 
during fiscal and  we sold million and million  respectively  of reserved products 
our products are used by communications electronics oems that have designed our products into communications equipment 
for many of our products  we gain these design wins through a lengthy sales cycle  which often includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
moreover  once a customer has designed a particular supplier s components into a product  substituting another supplier s components often requires substantial design changes  which involve significant cost  time  effort and risk 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed foreseeable demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the estimated realizable value of such inventories to us is generally zero 
on a quarterly basis  we also assess the net realizable value of our inventories 
when the estimated asp  less costs to sell our inventory  falls below our inventory cost  we adjust our inventory to its current estimated market value 
during fiscal there were no charges to adjust product costs to their estimated market values 
increases to the lower of cost or market lcm inventory reserves may be required based upon actual asps and changes to our current estimates  which would impact our gross margin percentage in future periods 
research and development our research and development r d expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs to develop new semiconductor products  allocated indirect costs of the r d function  photo mask and other costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices  and design and test tool costs 
our r d expenses also include the costs for design automation advanced package development and non cash stock based compensation charges for r d personnel 
r d expense decreased million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is due to a reduction in r d headcount from september to september  driven by restructuring activities and cost cutting measures  partially offset by our ongoing cost associated with our acquisition of the freescale sigmatel design center 
r d expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is due to a reduction in r d headcount from september to september other restructuring activities and cost cutting measures also contributed to the reduction in r d expense 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include personnel costs  sales representative commissions  advertising and other marketing costs 
our sg a expenses also include costs of corporate functions including legal  accounting  treasury  human resources  customer service  sales  marketing  field application 
table of contents engineering  allocated indirect costs of the sg a function  and non cash stock based compensation charges for sg a personnel 
sg a expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the decline in sg a headcount from september to september resulting from restructuring activities and cost cutting measures 
sg a expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the decline in sg a headcount from september to september resulting from restructuring activities and cost cutting measures 
the majority of the headcount decrease occurred at the end of the fiscal year  as a result of the bmp business unit sale 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization expense for intangible assets acquired in various business combinations 
our remaining intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
amortization expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in amortization expense is primarily attributable to the completion of amortization on an intangible asset in the third quarter of fiscal amortization expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in amortization expense is primarily attributable to the impairment of the intangible assets related to our former wireless business unit recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal asset impairments during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million  consisting primarily of an million impairment of a patent license with freescale semiconductor  inc  land and fixed asset impairments of million  electronic design automation eda tool impairments of million  intangible asset impairments of million 
asset impairments recorded in continuing operations were million  asset impairments related to the bmp and bba business units of million were recorded in discontinued operations 
as a result of the sale of our bba business and decrease in revenues in the continuing business  the company determined that the technology license with freescale semiconductor inc had no value and therefore recorded an impairment charge of million for the license  of which million was recorded in discontinued operations and million in operating expenses in the year ended october  during fiscal  we continued our review and assessment of the future prospects of its businesses  products and projects with particular attention given to the bba business unit 
the challenges in the competitive dsl market resulted in the net book value of certain assets within the bba business unit to be considered not fully recoverable 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million related to goodwill  million related to intangible assets  million related to property  plant and equipment and million related to eda tools 
the impairment charges have been included in net loss from discontinued operations 
during fiscal  we reevaluated our reporting unit operations with particular attention given to various scenarios for the bmp business 
the determination was made that the net book value of certain assets within the bmp business unit were considered not fully recoverable 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million related to goodwill  million related to eda tools and technology licenses and million related to property  plant and equipment  respectively 
the impairment charges have been included in net loss from discontinued operations 
asset impairment charged to continuing operations in fiscal of million consisted primarily of property  plant and equipment charges

other income  net for fiscal was primarily comprised of million of investment and interest income on invested cash balances  million of gains on investments in equity securities  including primarily the gain of million on the sale of our skyworks shares and investment credits realized on asset disposals 
provision for income taxes in fiscal  and  we recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million  respectively  primarily reflecting income taxes imposed on our foreign subsidiaries 
all of our us federal income taxes and the majority of our state income taxes are offset by fully reserved deferred tax assets 
unless there is a change of ownership under section of the internal revenue code  as amended  which would limit our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we expect our tax provision in future years to decrease slightly due to the contraction of our business activities outside of the us  primarily in india and china  partially offset by the scheduled expiration of certain tax holidays in india in fiscal as of october   we had approximately billion of net deferred income tax assets  which are primarily related to us federal income tax net operating loss nol carryforwards and capitalized r d expenses and which can be used to offset taxable income in subsequent years 
approximately million of the nol carryforwards were acquired in business combinations  and under fasb asc sfas r  which will be effective in fiscal  the benefit of which  if any  will decrease our provision for income taxes 
the deferred tax assets acquired in the merger with globespanvirata are subject to limitations imposed by section of the internal revenue code  as amended 
such limitations are not expected to impair our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets 
as of october   we have a valuation allowance recorded against all of our us and state deferred tax assets and foreign operations have recorded a net deferred tax liability of million 
we do not expect to recognize any domestic income tax benefits relating to future operating losses until we believe that such tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
on september   the company adopted the provisions of the fasb asc fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fasb asc fin  a company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fasb asc fin also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
adopting fasb asc fin had the following impact on the company s financial statements increased long term liabilities by million and retained deficit by million and decreased its long term assets by million and current income taxes payable by million 
as of september   the company had million of unrecognized tax benefits of which million  if recognized  would affect its effective tax rate 
as of october  and october   the company had million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits of which million and million  respectively  if recognized  would affect its effective tax rate 
the company s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes 
as of october  and october   the company had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of million and million  respectively  net of income tax benefit on its balance sheet 

table of contents the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions and has also acquired and divested certain businesses for which it has retained certain tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
the company and its acquired and divested businesses are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
based on the results of an audit  a material effect on the company s income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
the company files us and state income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation 
the fiscal years through generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  sales of non core assets  borrowings and operating cash flow 
in addition  the company has generated additional liquidity in the past through the sale of equity securities and may from time to time do so in the future 
our cash and cash equivalents increased million between october  and october  the increase was primarily due to million of proceeds from the sale of our bba business  million of proceeds from a common stock offering  million from the release of restricted cash in connection with a letter of credit with a vendor  million of proceeds from the sale of intellectual property  million proceeds from the resolution of divestiture acquisition related escrows  million of cash provided by operations  million from the return of collateral deposits on interest rate swaps and million proceeds from sales of equity securities offset by million of payments in connection with repurchases and retirements of long term debt  million net repayments on short term debt  million of net payments for acquisitions and million of payments for termination of interest rate swaps 
at october   we had a total of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
these notes are due in march  but the holders may require us to repurchase  for cash  all or part of their notes on march   march  and march  at a price of of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
the company has entered into  and intends to continue to enter into  privately negotiated agreements to exchange a portion of its outstanding convertible subordinated notes for equity securities  cash or a combination thereof 
at october   we also had a total of million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior secured notes outstanding 
the sale of the our investment in jazz semiconductor  inc jazz in february and the sale of two other equity investments in january qualified as asset dispositions requiring us to make offers to repurchase a portion of the notes no later than days following the february asset dispositions 
based on the proceeds received from these asset dispositions and our cash investments in assets other than current assets related to our business made within days following the asset dispositions  we were required to make an offer to repurchase not more than million of the senior secured notes  at of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest in february as a result of acceptance of the offer by our bondholders  million of the senior secured notes were repurchased during the second quarter of fiscal we recorded a pretax loss on debt repurchase of million during the second quarter of fiscal that included the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
following the sale of the bmp business unit  we made an offer to repurchase million of the senior secured notes at of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest in september as a result of the acceptance of the offer by our bondholders  million of the senior secured notes were repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a pretax loss on debt repurchase of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal that included the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
the pretax loss on debt repurchase of million has been included in net loss from discontinued operations 
due to the receipt of proceeds in excess of the million repurchase and other cash investments in assets  million of the senior secured notes was classified as current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of october  following the sale of the bba business unit  the company made an offer to repurchase million of the senior secured notes at of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest in august as a result of the acceptance of the offer by the company s bondholders  million of the senior secured notes were repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal in a separate transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company purchased an additional million of the senior secured notes at of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
the company recorded a pretax loss on debt repurchase of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal that included the write off of deferred debt issuance costs  million was recorded in interest expense in continuing operations  and million was recorded in net loss from discontinued operations 
subsequent to october   the company issued a redemption notice announcing that it will redeem all of the remaining million senior secured notes on december  the redemption price will be equal to 
table of contents of the principal amount of the senior secured notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
accordingly  the remaining million senior secured notes have been classified as current in the company s consolidated balance sheets as of october  we also have a million credit facility with a bank the credit facility  under which we had borrowed million as of october  this credit facility expires on november  as permitted by the terms of the credit facility  we plan to repay any outstanding balance under the credit facility on or before may  through the collection of receivables in the ordinary course of business or out of our cash balances 
in september  the company raised net proceeds of approximately million in a common stock offering and used the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of indebtedness and for capital expenses 
in october   the company s underwriter exercised its over allotment option to purchase additional shares of the company s common stock 
net proceeds to the company  after expenses  were approximately million 
recent tightening of the credit markets and unfavorable economic conditions have led to a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in the credit and equity markets 
as demonstrated by recent activity  we were able to access the equity markets to raise cash in september however  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions 
in addition  if signs of improvement in the global economy do not progress as expected and the economic slowdown continues or worsens  our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if that happens  our ability to access the capital or credit markets may worsen and we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to repay our million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes when they become due in march or earlier as a result of the mandatory repurchase requirements 
the first mandatory repurchase date for the convertible subordinated notes is march  in addition to the equity offering mentioned above  we have completed certain business restructuring activities including the sale of our bmp and bba businesses for cash as well as operating expense reductions which have improved our financial performance 
we also initiated various actions including the exchange of new securities for a portion of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes and the repurchase of our outstanding senior secured notes 
we will continue to explore other restructuring and re financing alternatives as well as supplemental financing alternatives including  but not limited to  an accounts receivable credit facility 
in the event we are unable to satisfy or refinance all of our outstanding debt obligations as the obligations are required to be paid  we will be required to consider strategic and other alternatives  including  among other things  the sale of assets to generate funds  the negotiation of revised terms of our indebtedness  additional exchanges of our existing indebtedness obligations for new securities and additional equity offerings 
we have retained financial advisors to assist us in considering these strategic  restructuring or other alternatives 
there is no assurance that we would be successful in completing any of these alternatives 
further  we may not be able to refinance any portion of our debt on favorable terms or at all 
our failure to satisfy or refinance any of our indebtedness obligations as they come due  including through additional exchanges of new securities for existing indebtedness obligations or additional equity offerings  would result in a default and potential acceleration of our remaining indebtedness obligations and would have a material adverse effect on our business 
given these actions taken to date  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  together with cash expected to be generated from product sales  will be sufficient to fund our operations  research and development  anticipated capital expenditures and working capital for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended october  october  september net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents

table of contents on october   the company adopted fasb asc sfas no 
 fair value measurements  for its financial assets and liabilities 
the company s adoption of fasb asc sfas no 
did not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
fasb asc sfas no 
provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
fasb asc sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
fasb asc sfas no 
also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs  where available 
the following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the company uses to measure fair value 
level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
fasb asc sfas no 
requires the use of observable market inputs quoted market prices when measuring fair value and requires a level quoted price to be used to measure fair value whenever possible 
in accordance with fasb asc fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 the company elected to defer until october  the adoption of fasb asc sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis

 measuring liabilities at fair value asu no 

asu amends accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements 
specifically  asu provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following methods a valuation technique that uses a the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or b quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets and or a valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of topic of the accounting standards codification 
asu also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to adjust to include inputs relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability 
asu is effective for the first reporting period after the issuance  which will require the company to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal the company does not believe that adoption of asu will have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to business combinations  revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  long lived assets  deferred income taxes  valuation of warrants  valuation of equity securities  stock based compensation and restructuring charges 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
business combinations we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
because of the expertise required to value intangible assets and in process research and development ipr d  we typically engage a third party valuation firm to assist management in determining those values 
valuation of intangible assets and ipr d entails significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  determining the timing and expected costs to complete projects  estimating future cash flows from product sales  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe that the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected by incurring charges to our statements of operations 
additionally  estimates for purchase price allocations may change as subsequent information becomes available 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the sales price and terms are fixed and determinable  and iv the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these terms are typically met upon shipment of product to the customer 
the majority of our distributors have limited stock rotation rights  which allow them to rotate up to of product in their inventory two times per 
table of contents year 
we recognize revenue to these distributors upon shipment of product to the distributor  as the stock rotation rights are limited and we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate and establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with fasb asc statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and was not significant for any periods presented 
revenue with respect to sales to customers to whom we have significant obligations after delivery is deferred until all significant obligations have been completed 
at october  and october   deferred revenue related to shipments of products for which we have on going performance obligations was million and million  respectively 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our operations and the timing of revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as sales commissions 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenues could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we use a specific identification method for some items  and a percentage of aged receivables for others 
the percentages are determined based on our past experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
at october  and october   our allowances for doubtful accounts were million and million  respectively 
derivatives the company accounts for derivatives in accordance with fasb asc sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as of october  the company s derivatives consisted of warrants to purchase million shares of mindspeed common stock 
the fair value of this warrant is determined using a standard black scholes merton valuation model with assumptions consistent with current market conditions and our intent to liquidate the warrant over a specified time period 
the black scholes merton valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
changes in these assumptions  or in the underlying valuation model  could cause the fair value of the mindspeed warrant to vary significantly from period to period 
changes in the value of the warrant are recorded in income in the period in which they occur 
inventories we assess the recoverability of our inventories at least quarterly through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand  generally over twelve months 
foreseeable demand is based upon all available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycle information 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand or product pricing is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
further  on a quarterly basis  we assess the net realizable value of our inventories 
when the estimated average selling price of our inventory net of selling expenses falls below our inventory cost  we adjust our inventory to its current estimated market value 
at october  and october   our inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 

table of contents long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
they are also continually monitored and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined using available market data  comparable asset quotes and or discounted cash flow models 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized 
instead  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
goodwill is tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter and  if necessary  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
in our annual test in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we assessed the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing based upon the company s fair value based on the quoted market price of the company s common stock and a market multiple analysis  both under the market approach 
the resulting fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to the carrying amounts of the net assets of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
as we have only one reporting unit  the carrying amount of the reporting unit equals the net book value of the company 
we elected not to use the discounted cash flow analysis in our fiscal analysis because we believe that our fair value calculated based on quoted market prices and market multiples is a more accurate method 
fair value based on quoted market price analysis the fair value of the company is calculated based on the quoted market price of the company s common stock listed on the nasdaq global select market as of the date of the goodwill impairment analysis multiplied by shares outstanding also as of that date 
the fair value of the company is then compared to the carrying value of the company as of the date of the goodwill impairment analysis 
fair value based on market multiple analysis we select several companies which we believe are comparable to our business and calculate their revenue multiples market capitalization divided by annual revenue based on available revenue information and related stock prices as of the date of the goodwill impairment analysis 
the comparable companies are selected based upon similarity of products 
we used a revenue multiple of in our analysis of comparable companies multiples for the ipm reporting unit as of october  compared to a revenue multiple of in our annual goodwill evaluation 
this significant decline reflects the downward impact of the economic environment during the year 
we then calculate our fair value by multiplying the revenue multiple by an estimate of our future revenues 
the estimate is based on our internal forecasts used by management 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates  including  but not limited to  the determination of i the number of reporting units  ii the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and iii the fair values of the reporting units 
the estimates and assumptions described above  
table of contents along with other factors such as discount rates  will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses 
all of the goodwill reported on our balance sheet is attributable to the company s single reporting unit 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we determined  based on the methods described above  that the fair value of the company s single reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of the company s single reporting unit and therefore there is no impairment of goodwill as of october  income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in fasb asc sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in july the fasb issued fasb asc fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fasb asc fin provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb asc sfas 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fasb asc fin and in subsequent periods 
we adopted fasb asc fin effective september  and the provisions of fasb asc fin have been applied to all tax positions that were open to adjustment as of that date and all income tax positions commencing from that date 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fasb asc fin has been reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of our accumulated deficit as of september  prior to fiscal we determined our tax contingencies in accordance with fasb asc sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas 
we recorded estimated tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
deferred income taxes we evaluate our deferred income tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance is based upon our history of operating results  expectations of future taxable income and the ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies available to us 
in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets would be charged against income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  in the event we were to determine that we will more likely than not be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
valuation of equity securities we have a portfolio of strategic investments in non marketable equity securities 
we review equity securities periodically for other than temporary impairments  which requires significant judgment 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we evaluate  among other factors  i the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and iii our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
these reviews may include assessments of each investee s financial condition  its business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or by others 
we have experienced substantial impairments in the value of our equity securities over the past few years 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in our inability to recover the carrying

r 
in addition  forfeitures are estimated when recognizing compensation expense  and the estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
the black scholes merton model requires certain assumptions to determine an option fair value  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected life of the option 
the expected stock price volatility rates are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option or award 
the average expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options or awards granted are expected to be outstanding  as calculated using the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission s sab no 
consistent with the provisions of fasb asc sfas no 
r  we measure service based awards at the stock price on the grant date  performance based awards at the stock price on the grant date effected for performance conditions which we believe may impact vesting or exercisability and market performance based awards using the monte carlo simulation method giving consideration to the range of various vesting probabilities

sfas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  or sfas r we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in sfas r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to fasb asc sfas no 
r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool  or apic pool  related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation expense  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that were outstanding at the adoption of fasb asc sfas no 
r 
in addition we have elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock 
table of contents option exercises in additional paid in capital only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to us  in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
restructuring charges restructuring activities and related charges have related primarily to reductions in our workforce and related impact on the use of facilities 
the estimated charges contain estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time that the assumptions are made for example  the timing and amount of sublease income that will be achieved on vacated property and the operating costs to be paid until lease termination  and the discount rates used in determining the present value fair value of remaining minimum lease payments on vacated properties 
while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the relevant periods  the actual results may be different  and those differences could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial position or results of operations 
our policies require us to review the estimates and assumptions periodically and to reflect the effects of any revisions in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
such amounts also contain estimates and assumptions made by management  and are reviewed periodically and adjusted accordingly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  the mindspeed warrant  equity securities  short term debt and long term debt 
our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital and the maximization of after tax returns on our investment portfolio 
consequently  we invest with only high credit quality issuers  and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of october   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
we hold a warrant to purchase approximately million shares of mindspeed common stock at an exercise price of per share through june for financial accounting purposes  this is a derivative instrument and the fair value of the warrant is subject to significant risk related to changes in the market price of mindspeed s common stock 
as of october   a decrease in the market price of mindspeed s common stock would result in a million decrease in the fair value of this warrant 
at october   the market price of mindspeed s common stock was per share 
during fiscal  the market price of mindspeed s common stock ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
our short term debt consists of borrowings under a day credit facility and floating rate senior secured notes 
the interest rate on our short term debt is day libor plus  which is reset weekly and was approximately at october  this credit facility expires on november  interest related to our floating rate senior secured notes is at three month libor plus  which is reset quarterly and was approximately at october  we do not believe our short term debt is subject to significant market risk 
our long term debt consists of convertible subordinated notes with interest at fixed rates 
the fair value of our convertible subordinated notes is subject to significant fluctuation due to their convertibility into shares of our common stock 
as a result of the repurchase of million of the company s floating rate senior secured notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our two million swap agreements were terminated resulting in a loss of million  million of which was recognized in the fiscal quarter ended october  the remaining million unrecognized loss  which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  will be recognized over the remaining term of the floating rate senior secured notes due in order to match the loss with the cash flows it was intended to hedge against 
all of the collateral the company was required to post with the counterparty was returned as of october  at october   we have no interest rate swap agreements outstanding

exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our business in the future 
approximately million of our million of cash and cash equivalents at october  was located in foreign countries where we conduct business  including approximately million in india and million in china 
these amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the united states without the imposition and payment  where applicable  of local taxes 
further  the repatriation of these funds is subject to compliance with applicable local government laws and regulations  and in some cases  requires governmental consent  including in india and china 
our inability to repatriate these funds quickly and without any required governmental consents may limit the resources available to us to fund our operations in the united states and other locations or to pay indebtedness
