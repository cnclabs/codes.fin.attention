item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
as of december   selective hr had approximately  worksite employees  of which were located in the state of florida 

table of contents as a co employer for some of its clients  selective hr is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to labor  tax  employment  employee benefits  and immigration matters 
by contracting with its clients and creating a co employer relationship with the worksite employees  selective hr may be assuming certain contractual and legal obligations and responsibilities of an employer and could incur liability for violations of such laws and regulations  even if it was not actually responsible for the conduct giving rise to such liability 
some states in which selective hr operates have already passed licensing or registration requirements for peos 
these laws and regulations vary from state to state but generally provide for the monitoring of the fiscal responsibility of peos 
currently  many of these laws and regulations do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of co employers 
there can be no assurance that selective hr will be able to satisfy new or revised laws and regulations 
flood insurance and related regulation we are a servicing carrier in the wyo program of the us government s nfip 
the nfip is administered by the federal emergency management agency fema  which is  in turn  part of the department of homeland security 
the wyo program is a cooperative undertaking of the insurance industry and fema 
the wyo program allows participating property and casualty insurance companies to write and service the standard flood insurance policy in their own names  while ceding all of the premiums collected and losses incurred on these policies to the federal government 
we receive the following amounts from the nfip i fees associated with servicing policy premium  and ii fees associated with the handling of claims 
on june   the nfip revised their fee structure associated with the handling of claims to provide for fees of of direct premiums written  which are paid even in non catastrophe years  coupled with fees equal to of all incurred losses 
prior to june   we received claims handling fees equal to of all incurred losses 
although these expenses could potentially change with future legislation  our servicing fee is currently of direct premiums written 
as of december   we served approximately  flood policies under the nfip through over  independent agents in states and the district of columbia 
the viability of the nfip s reinsurance program under the wyo program is an essential component of our diversified insurance services operations 
on september   a law was passed to extend the nfip authority to issue new policies  increase coverage on existing policies  and issue renewal policies until march  the nfip currently has borrowing authority in the amount of billion and has borrowed billion through this amount is expected to rise as claims from hurricane ike continue to mature 
the nfip calculates that they will reach the borrowing limit in the first quarter of fiscal year and fema is currently seeking additional borrowings from congress 
we continue to monitor developments with the nfip 
competition we face significant competition in both our insurance operations and diversified insurance services segments 
property and casualty insurance is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service  and is extensively regulated by state insurance departments 
in  we were ranked as the th largest property and casualty group in the us based on the npw  by us best in its list  top us property casualty groups 
the insurance operations compete with regional insurers  such as cincinnati financial corporation and harleysville group  inc  and national insurance companies  such as liberty mutual group  travelers companies  inc  the hartford financial services group  inc  and zurich financial services group 
we also compete against direct writers of insurance coverage  including insurance offered through competitors internet websites 
these writers  such as geico and the progressive corporation  offer coverage primarily in personal lines 
many of our competitors have more customers and more financial and operating resources than we do 
as a result  they have greater scalability and more information regarding their risks which  with the use of statistical and computer models  may give them greater ability to make pricing and underwriting decisions 
purchasers of property and casualty insurance products do not always differentiate between insurance carriers and differences in coverage 
the more significant competitive factors for most of our insurance products are financial ratings  safety management  price  coverage terms  claims service  and technology 
in addition  we also face competition within each insurance agency that sells its insurance products as the agencies represent more than one insurance company 
with regard to our diversified insurance services segment  according to the most recent published information  selective hr was ranked as the th largest peo in a staffing industry report published by staffing industry analysts  inc  based on gross revenue 
based on information  our flood line of business is the th largest wyo carrier for the nfip based on information obtained from statutory annual statements 
please refer to item a 
risk factors  of this form k for a discussion of the factors that could impact our ability to compete 

table of contents seasonality our insurance business experiences modest seasonality with regard to premiums written 
due to the general timing of commercial policy renewals  premiums written are usually highest in january and july and lowest during the fourth quarter of the year 
although the writing of insurance policies experiences modest seasonality  the premiums related to these policies are earned consistently over the period of coverage 
losses and loss expenses incurred tend to remain consistent throughout the year  unless a catastrophe occurs from man made or weather related events such as hail  tornadoes  windstorms  hurricanes  and nor easters 
customers no one customer or independent agency accounts for or more of our total revenue or the revenue of any one of our business segments 
employees at december   we had approximately  employees  of which  worked in the insurance operations and investments segments and worked in the diversified insurance services segment

table of contents item a 
risk factors certain risk factors exist that can have a significant impact on our business  liquidity  capital resources  results of operations  and financial condition 
the impact of these risk factors could also impact certain actions that we take as part of our long term capital strategy including  but not limited to  contributing capital to subsidiaries in our insurance operations and diversified insurance services segments  issuing additional debt and or equity securities  repurchasing shares of the parent s common stock  or changing stockholders dividends 
the following list of risk factors is not exhaustive and others may exist 
we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
consequently  we can neither predict such new risk factors nor assess the impact  if any  they might have on our business in the future 
difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy may adversely affect our revenue and profitability and harm our business  and these conditions may not improve in the near future 
our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally  in both the us and abroad 
as widely reported  financial markets in the us  europe  and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption from the second half of through concerns over the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  a declining real estate market in the us  increased unemployment  volatile energy and commodity prices and geopolitical issues  among other factors  have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial and insurance markets going forward 
these concerns have also led to declines in business and consumer confidence  which have precipitated an economic slowdown and fears of a sustained recession 
in addition  the fixed income markets are experiencing a period of extreme volatility  which has negatively impacted market liquidity conditions and increased the risk that issuers  or guarantors  of fixed maturity securities will default on principal and interest payments 
initially  the effects were focused on the subprime segment of the mortgage backed securities market 
however  this volatility has since spread  negatively impacting i a broad range of mortgage and asset backed and other fixed income securities  including those rated investment grade  ii the us and international credit and interbank money markets generally  and iii a wide range of financial institutions and markets  asset classes  and sectors 
as a result  the market for fixed income securities has experienced decreased liquidity  increased price volatility  credit downgrade events  and increased probability of default 
securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and may be hard to sell 
domestic and international equity markets have also been experiencing heightened volatility and turmoil  with issuers such as our company exposed to the mortgage securities and credit markets particularly affected 
these factors and the continuing market disruption may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio  revenues  and profit margins 
factors such as consumer spending  business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  and inflation  all affect the business and economic environment and  indirectly  the amount and profitability of our business 
in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment  and lower consumer spending  the demand for insurance products could be adversely affected 
in addition  we are impacted by the recent decrease in commercial and new home construction and home ownership in because of npw in our commercial lines business was generated through contractors business 
further unfavorable economic developments could adversely affect our earnings if our customers have less need for insurance coverage  cancel existing insurance policies  modify coverage or choose not to renew with us 
these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay premiums as they come due 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries  which may have an adverse effect on us 

table of contents we are also subject to the risk that the issuers  or guarantors  of fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal and interest payments due under the terms of the securities 
at december   our fixed maturity securities portfolio represented approximately of our total invested assets 
approximately of our fixed maturity securities are state  municipality  or us government obligations 
the occurrence of a major economic downturn such as the current economy  acts of corporate malfeasance  widening credit spreads  budgetary deficits  or other events that adversely affect the issuers or guarantors of these securities could cause the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and our net income to decline and the default rate of our fixed maturity securities portfolio to increase 
with economic uncertainty  credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected and a ratings downgrade of the issuers or guarantors of the securities in our portfolio could also cause the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and our net income to decrease 
for example  rating agency downgrades of monoline insurance companies during contributed to a decline in the carrying value and the market liquidity of our municipal bond investment portfolio 
a reduction in the value of our investment portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
levels of write down are impacted by our assessment of the impairment  including a review of the underlying collateral of structured securities  and our intent and ability to hold securities which have declined in value until recovery 
if we determine to reposition or realign portions of the portfolio where we determine not to hold certain securities in an unrealized loss position to recovery  then we will incur an other than temporary impairment otti charge 
the current economic crisis has also raised the possibility of future legislative and regulatory actions  in addition to the recent enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa  which could further impact our business 
we discuss government actions further in this section 
we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur  or what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our loss reserves may not be adequate to cover actual losses and expenses 
we are required to maintain loss reserves for our estimated liability for losses and loss expenses associated with reported and unreported insurance claims for each accounting period 
from time to time  we adjust reserves and  if the reserves are inadequate  must increase our reserves 
an increase in reserves i reduces net income and stockholders equity for the period in which the deficiency in reserves is identified  and ii could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  financial condition  and financial strength and debt ratings 
our estimates of reserve amounts are based on facts and circumstances of which we are aware  including our expectations of the ultimate settlement and claim administration expenses  predictions of future events  trends in claims severity and frequency  and other subjective factors relating to our insurance policies in force 
there is no method for precisely estimating the ultimate liability for settlement of claims 
we regularly review our reserving techniques and our overall amount of reserves 
we also review information regarding each claim for losses  including potential extra contractual liabilities  or amounts paid in excess of the policy limits  which may not be covered by our contracts with reinsurers  our loss history and the industry s loss history  legislative enactments  judicial decisions and legal developments regarding damages  changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including inflation 
in addition to the above  we continue to manage our claims process in an effort to reduce claim cycle times and improve workflows 
the initiatives undertaken in included i claims automation  ii enhancement of claims quality and control  iii litigation management  iv enhancement of compliance and bill review  v enhancement of workers compensation review  and vi enhancement of salvage and subrogation review 
as these initiatives are anticipated to accelerate the timing of reserve establishment  we ultimately expect lower loss costs to be realized through reduced legal and loss adjustment expenses 
this acceleration will inflate our severity statistics in the near term  but we expect the longer term benefit to be a more efficient management of the claims process 
we cannot be certain that the reserves we establish are adequate or will be adequate in the future 
for more information regarding reserves  see the section entitled reserve for losses and loss expenses in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
as a property and casualty insurer we are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic events 
results of property and casualty insurers  such as our company  are subject to weather and other conditions 
while one year may be relatively free of major weather occurrences or other disasters  another year may have numerous such events  causing results to be materially worse than other years 
the insurance subsidiaries have experienced catastrophe losses and we expect them to experience such losses in the future 

table of contents various natural and man made events can cause catastrophes  including  but not limited to  hurricanes  tornadoes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  terrorism  explosions  severe winter weather  floods and fires  some of which may be related to climate changes 
the frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is determined by the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event 
although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty lines  most of the catastrophe related claims of the insurance subsidiaries historically have been related to commercial property and homeowners coverages 
our property and casualty insurance business is concentrated geographically in the eastern and midwestern regions of the us new jersey accounted for of our total npw during the year ended december  the insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
reinsurance  however  may prove inadequate if the modeling software we use to analyze the insurance subsidiaries risk results in an inadequate purchase of reinsurance by us  a major catastrophic loss exceeds the reinsurance limit or the reinsurers financial capacity  or the frequency of catastrophe losses result in the insurance subsidiaries exceeding their one reinstatement 
continued deterioration in the public debt and equity markets  as well as in the private investment marketplace  could lead to investment losses  which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
like many other property and casualty insurance companies  we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a significant portion of our revenues and earnings 
we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risks  primarily relating to interest rates  credit spreads  equity price risks  and the changes in market value of our alternative investment portfolio 
a decline could occur as a result of  among other things  a decrease in market liquidity  falling interest rates  decreased dividend payment rates  negative market perception of credit risk with respect to types of securities in our portfolio  a decline in the performance of the underlying collateral of our structured securities  reduced returns on our other investments  including our portfolio of alternative investments  or general market conditions 
our notes payable and line of credit are subject to certain debt to capitalization restrictions and net worth covenants  which could also be impacted by a significant decline in investment values  and further otti charges could be necessary if there is a future significant decline in investment values 
depending on market conditions going forward  and in the event of extreme prolonged market events  such as the global credit crisis  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition  debt and financial strength ratings  and our ability to access capital markets as a result of realized losses  impairments and changes in unrealized positions 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates may decrease the fair value of our existing fixed maturity investments and declines in interest rates may result in an increase in the fair value of our existing fixed maturity investments 
our fixed income investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments  that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates resulting from governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond our control 
a rise in interest rates would increase the net unrealized loss position of the investment portfolio  offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested and new investments 
conversely  a decline in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized loss position of the investment portfolio  offset by lower rates of return on funds reinvested and new investments 
we seek to mitigate our interest rate risk associated with holding fixed maturity investments by monitoring and maintaining the average duration of our portfolio with a view toward achieving an adequate after tax return without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk 
although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities 
equity price risk our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential adverse impact on our equity investments associated with volatility in equity market prices  decreased dividend payment rates  and reduced returns in certain of our other investments  which reduces our investment portfolio 
 or million  of our total investment portfolio was equity securities and  or million  of our total investment portfolio was alternative investments as december   or million  of our alternative investments were private equity investments including secondary market  which represented of our total investment portfolio as of december  
table of contents we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based on the discount rate and expected long term rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other post retirement benefit obligations 
sustained declines in long term interest rates or equity returns likely would have a negative effect on the funded status of our pension plan 
even in the absence of a market downturn  we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility 
the factors discussed above have resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses  including write downs for otti charges  in our equity and other investment portfolio 
any further decline in the market value of our equity and other investments would continue to reduce our revenue  stockholders equity  and policyholders surplus  which could impact our ability to issue additional insurance policies 
for more information regarding market  interest rate  credit  and equity price risk  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form k 
the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical 
historically  the results of the property and casualty insurance industry have experienced significant fluctuations due to competition  occurrence or severity of catastrophic events  levels of capacity  general economic conditions  interest rates  and other factors 
demand for insurance is influenced significantly by prevailing general economic conditions 
the supply of insurance is related to prevailing prices  the levels of insured losses and the levels of industry surplus which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance industry 
as a result  the insurance industry historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
for example  competitors pricing business below technical levels could force us to reduce our profit margin in order to protect our best business 
we have experienced the following fluctuations in commercial lines premium pricing  excluding exposure pure price  over the past several years year percentage increase decrease from year to year increases ranging from to as an example of pricing and loss trends on the statutory combined ratio  taking a pure price decline of and removing the expense that directly varies with premium volume yields an adverse combined ratio impact of approximately point  in addition to a claims inflation increase of  will cause the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio to increase approximately points  all else remaining equal 
the combination of claims inflation and price decreases could raise the combined ratio approximately points in this example  absent any initiatives targeted to address these trends 
the industry s profitability also is affected by unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment that affect investment returns  inflationary pressures medical and economic that affect the size of losses  judicial  regulatory  legislative  and legal decisions that affect insurers liabilities  changes in the frequency and severity of losses  pricing and availability of reinsurance in the marketplace  and weather related impacts due to the effects of climate changes 
any of the above developments could cause the supply or demand for insurance to change  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents there can be no assurance that the actions of the us government  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies to try to stabilize the financial markets will achieve their intended effect 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets  on october   president george bush signed the eesa into law 
under the eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions to try to stabilize the financial markets 
the eesa or similar legislation  as well as monetary or fiscal actions by the us federal reserve board or comparable authorities in other countries  may fail to stabilize the financial markets 
these new forms of legislation and actions may have other consequences on financial factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and the markets for the financial instruments purchased and sold by the us department of treasury pursuant to the eesa 
these other consequences could materially affect our investments  results of operations and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict 
the failure to effectively implement this legislation and related actions  or ineffectiveness of the legislation and actions  could result in a crisis of investor confidence in the us economy and financial markets  which could increase constraints on the liquidity available in the banking system and financial markets and increase pressure on the price of our fixed income and equity portfolios 
these results could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and the trading price of the parent s common stock 
in the event of future material deterioration in business conditions  we may need to raise additional capital or consider other transactions to manage our capital position and liquidity 
however  since we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the marketplace  we may find it difficult to raise capital  and if we do  we may be forced to incur a relatively high cost to obtain such capital 
although we do not plan to participate in any of the eesa programs  it is possible that our competitors may  and those competitors may gain a competitive advantage by accessing funds through the eesa programs 
furthermore  it is possible that some companies  including competitors  may attempt to use the existing market volatility and enhanced market oversight as a platform for isolating poorly performing assets into separate stand alone entities 
there can be no assurance as to the effect that any such actions will have on our competitive position 
in addition  we are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities and non governmental self regulatory agencies 
in light of the current financial crisis  some of these authorities have implemented  or may in the future implement  new or enhanced regulatory requirements intended to restore confidence in financial institutions and reduce the likelihood of similar economic events in the future 
these authorities may also seek to exercise their supervisory or enforcement authority in new or more robust ways 
such events could affect the way we conduct our business and manage our capital  and may require us to satisfy increased capital requirements 
these developments  if they occurred  could materially affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic approved the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp on november  the program was designed to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts  and certain holding companies  and by providing full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
if we purchase securities guaranteed under the tlgp  and the program does not strengthen confidence or encourage liquidity in the marketplace  the carrying value of such securities in our investment portfolio could be adversely affected 
we are subject to the types of risks inherent in making alternative investments in private limited partnerships 
our other investments include alternative investments in private limited partnerships that invest in various strategies such as private equity  mezzanine debt  distressed debt  and real estate 
as of december   these types of investments represented of our total invested assets 
the amount and timing of income from these partnerships tends to be variable as a result of the performance and investment stage of the underlying investments 
the timing of distributions from the partnerships  which depends on particular events relating to the underlying investments  as well as the partnerships schedules for making distributions and their need for cash  can be difficult to predict 
as a result  the amount of income that we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
in addition  the general volatility in the capital markets  the dislocation of the credit markets  and reduced values of financial assets globally in the last half of has reduced investment income from these types of investments 
pursuant to the various limited partnership agreements of these partnerships  we are committed to potential future capital calls in the aggregate amount of approximately million as of december  
table of contents we are also subject to the risks arising from the fact that the determination of the fair value of these types of investments is inherently subjective 
the general partner of each of these partnerships generally reports the change in the fair value of the interests in the partnership on a one quarter lag because of the nature of the underlying assets or liabilities 
since these partnerships underlying investments consist primarily of assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar assets  the valuation of interests in these partnerships are subject to a higher level of subjectivity and unobservable inputs than substantially all of our other investments 
pursuant to fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas  each of these general partners is required to determine fair value by the price obtainable for the sale of the interest at the time of determination 
valuations based on unobservable inputs are subject to greater scrutiny and reconsideration from one reporting period to the next and therefore  the changes in the fair value of these investments may be subject to significant fluctuations which could lead to significant decreases in their fair value from one reporting period to the next 
since we record our investments in these various partnerships under the equity method of accounting  any decreases in the valuation of these investments would negatively impact our results of operations 
the valuation of our investments include methodologies  estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
fixed maturity  equity and trading securities and short term investments  which are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  represented the majority of our total cash and invested assets as of december  as required under accounting rules  we have categorized these securities into a three level hierarchy  based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  the next priority to quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or in markets that are not active and other inputs that can be derived principally from  or corroborated by  observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the exit price  including assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability level 
an asset or liability s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation 
we generally use a combination of independent pricing services and broker quotes to price our investment securities 
at december   approximately and of these securities represented level and level  respectively 
however  prices provided by independent pricing services and independent broker quotes can vary widely even for the same security 
rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and may result in an increase in non cash otti charges 
the determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position 
the determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is based on our periodic evaluation and assessment of our investments and known and inherent risks associated with the various asset classes 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in impairments as such evaluations are revised 
there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken reflected in our financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be taken in the future 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 
an investment in a fixed maturity or equity security  is impaired if its fair value falls below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be other than temporary 
we regularly review our entire investment portfolio for declines in value 
if we believe that a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary  we record the decline as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income for those securities that are held as available for sale 
if we believe the decline is other than temporary we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of income 
management s assessment of a decline in value includes current judgment as to the financial position and future prospects of the security issuer as well as our ability and intent to hold such security until a recovery could occur 

table of contents additionally  our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i whether the decline appears to be issuer or industry specific  ii the relationship of market prices per share to book value per share at the date of acquisition and date of evaluation  iii the price earnings ratio at the time of acquisition and date of evaluation  iv the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events that may influence the issuer s operations  v the recent income or loss of the issuer  vi the independent auditors report on the issuer s recent financial statements  vii the dividend policy of the issuer at the date of acquisition and the date of evaluation  viii any buy hold sell recommendations or price projections published by outside investment advisors  ix any rating agency announcements  x the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than carrying value  and xi the stress testing of projected cash flows under various economic and default scenarios 
as of december   there were securities in our portfolio in an unrealized loss position  including certain securities that were priced at a significant discount compared to our original cost due to uncertainties in the marketplace 
our gross unrealized losses on available for sale fixed maturity securities at december  were million  pre tax  in the aggregate and the component of gross unrealized losses for securities with a fair value of less than of their amortized costs was approximately million  pre tax  at such date 
realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial position 
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations 
insurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings issued by various nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros  based on factors relevant to policyholders 
ratings are not recommendations to buy  hold  or sell any of our securities 
higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims 
we and the insurance subsidiaries currently maintain i an am best financial strength rating of a with a stable financial strength outlook  ii a s p s financial strength rating of a with a negative outlook  iii a fitch financial strength rating of a with a stable outlook  and iv a moody s financial strength rating of a with a stable outlook 
a significant downgrade in ratings  from am best in particular  could i affect our ability to write new business with customers  some of whom are required under various third party agreements to maintain insurance with a carrier that maintains a specified minimum rating  or ii be an event of default under our line of credit 
pursuant to our line of credit agreement with wachovia bank  national association line of credit  the insurance subsidiaries must maintain a financial strength rating by am best of at least a two levels below our current rating at all times 
a default under our line of credit could lead to acceleration of principal  which could trigger default provisions under certain of our other debt instruments and could negatively impact our ability to borrow in the future 
as a result  any significant downgrade in ratings could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to financial strength ratings  various nrsros also publish credit ratings for us 
credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity 
currently  we maintain i an am best long term issuer credit rating of a with a stable long term credit outlook  ii a s p s long term local issuer credit rating of bbb with a negative outlook  iii a fitch long term issuer default rating of a with a stable outlook  and iv a moody s investor service moody s senior unsecured debt rating of baa with a stable outlook 
downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways  including making it more expensive for us to access capital markets 
the insurance subsidiaries are also parties to the pooling agreement that allows them to obtain a uniform rating from am best 
if one or more of the insurance subsidiaries suffered a ratings downgrade  the ability of the entire pool to maintain its uniform rating would be uncertain 
in view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions  including our competitors in the insurance industry  we believe it is possible that the external rating agencies i will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions  ii will increase the frequency and scope of their reviews  and iii may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain rating levels 
we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take  or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we compete with regional and national property and casualty insurance companies  including public and mutual companies  some of which do not use independent agents and write directly with insureds 
many of these competitors are larger than us and have greater financial and operating resources  as well as greater information scale 
the internet has also emerged as a significant place of new competition  both from existing competitors and new competitors 
a new form of competition may enter the marketplace as some reinsurers attempt to diversify their insurance risk by writing business in the primary marketplace 
because we sell our coverages through independent insurance agents who also are agents of our competitors  we face competition within each of our appointed independent insurance agencies 
we also face competition  primarily in the commercial insurance market  from entities that self insure their own risks 
some of our customers and potential customers from time to time examine the benefits and risks of self insuring as an alternative to traditional insurance 
the ability to self insure is generally only available to large risks 
however  some small and mid sized public entities do have the opportunity to partially self insure through the use of risk pools or joint insurance funds 
new competition could cause the supply or demand for insurance to change  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the occurrence of any acts of terrorism not covered by  or exceeding  reinsurance limits could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the us terrorism risk insurance act of tria  as amended  established the terrorism risk insurance program trip which became effective on november  and was a three year federal program effective through on december   president george bush signed a bill extending tria for two more years  continuing trip through on december   president george bush signed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of tripra which further extended trip for seven years until december   and also eliminated the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terrorism 
this seven year period was designed to provide the market with much needed stability 
tria requires sharing the risk of future losses from terrorism between private insurers and the federal government  and is applicable to almost all commercial lines of insurance 
insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the us  including our company  are required to participate in this program 
tria rescinded all previously approved exclusions for terrorism 
policyholders of non workers compensation policies have the option to accept or decline the terrorism coverage we offer in our policies  or negotiate other terms 
in  approximately of our commercial non workers compensation policyholders purchased terrorism coverage 
the terrorism coverage is mandatory for all workers compensation primary policies 
in addition   or of the primary states in which we write commercial property coverage  mandated during the coverage of fire following an act of terrorism 
these provisions apply to new policies written after enactment of tria 
a terrorism act must be certified by the us secretary of treasury in order to be covered by tria 
each participating insurance company will be responsible for paying out a certain amount in claims a deductible before federal assistance becomes available 
this deductible  which was equal to approximately million in  is based on a percentage of commercial lines direct earned premiums for lines subject to tria from the prior calendar year 
for losses above an insurer s deductible  the federal government will cover  while the insurer contributes 
although the provisions of tripra will serve to mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial 
the parent is a holding company  and its subsidiaries may have a limited ability to declare dividends  and thus it may not have access to the cash that is needed to meet its cash needs 
substantially all of the parent s operations are conducted through its subsidiaries 
restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries  particularly the insurance subsidiaries  to pay dividends or make other cash payments to the parent may materially affect its ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and dividends on its common stock 
under the terms of our debt and line of credit agreements and financial solvency laws affecting insurers  the parent s subsidiaries are permitted to incur indebtedness up to certain levels which may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends  or the making of loans by its subsidiaries to the parent 
we cannot assure that the laws and agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of the parent s subsidiaries will permit such subsidiaries to provide the parent with sufficient dividends or distributions to fund the parent s cash needs 
sources of funds for the insurance subsidiaries primarily consist of premiums  investment income  and proceeds from sales and redemption of investments 
such funds are applied primarily to payment of claims  insurance operating expenses  income taxes and the purchase of investments  as well as dividends and other payments 

table of contents the insurance subsidiaries may declare and pay dividends to the parent only if they are permitted to do so under the insurance regulations of their respective state of domicile 
all of the states in which the insurance subsidiaries are domiciled regulate the payment of dividends 
some states  including new jersey  require that notice is given to the relevant state insurance commissioner prior to our insurance subsidiary domiciled in that respective state declaring any dividends and distributions payable to the parent 
during the notice period  the state insurance commissioner may disallow all or part of the proposed dividend upon determination that i the insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to its liabilities and adequate to its financial needs and those of the policyholders  or ii the insurer is otherwise in a hazardous financial condition 
in addition  insurance regulators may block dividends or other payments to affiliates that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval upon determination that  because of the financial condition of the insurance subsidiary or otherwise  payment of a dividend or any other payment to an affiliate would be detrimental to an insurance subsidiary s policyholders or creditors 
selective hr may also declare and pay dividends  which are restricted by the operating needs of this entity as well as professional employer organization s licensing requirements to maintain a current ratio of at least we are subject to a variety of modeling risks which could have a material adverse impact on our business results 
we rely on complex financial models  such as predictive modeling  risk management solutions  the algo risk tool and value at risk var  which have been developed internally or by third parties to analyze historical loss costs and pricing  trends in claims severity and frequency  the occurrence of catastrophe losses  investment performance and portfolio risk 
flaws in these financial models and or faulty assumptions used by these financial models  could lead to increased losses 
for example  var is a method used by us to evaluate portfolio risk 
var is a probabilistic method of measuring the potential loss in portfolio value over a given time period and for a given distribution of historical returns 
portfolio risk  as measured by var  is affected by four primary risk factors asset concentration  asset volatility  asset correlation and systematic risk 
while var models are relatively sophisticated  the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models 
we believe that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk 
therefore  such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management 
our ability to reduce our exposure to risks depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance 
we transfer our risk exposure to other insurance and reinsurance companies through reinsurance arrangements 
through these arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of our losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of the insurance policy premiums 
while reinsurance agreements generally bind the reinsurance companies for the life of the business reinsured at generally fixed pricing  market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new business 
in certain circumstances  the price of reinsurance for business already reinsured may also increase 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions  which may vary significantly 
any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will  absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance  reduce our earnings 
accordingly  we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms  which could adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to those policies we issue 
in general  reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders  even when the reinsurer is liable to us 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
reinsurers which we have contracted with may default in their obligations as a result of insolvency  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
we cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us now or in the future or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis 
for example  we maintain reinsurance relationships with certain subsidiaries of american international group  inc  which is currently party to a securities lending agreement with the federal reserve and was also given a line of credit by the federal reserve in order to meet its liquidity needs 
due to the uncertainty associated with casualty business  current reinsurance recoverables are subject to the credit risk of the reinsurers 
the inability of any of our reinsurers to meet their financial obligations could materially and adversely affect our operations  as we remain primarily liable to our customers under the policies that we have insured 

table of contents we depend on independent insurance agents and other third party service providers 
we market and sell our insurance products through independent  non exclusive insurance agencies and brokers 
agents and brokers are not obligated to promote our insurance products  and they may also sell the insurance products of our competitors 
as a result  our business depends in part on the marketing and sales efforts of these agencies and brokers 
as we diversify and expand our business geographically  we may need to expand our network of agencies and brokers to successfully market our products 
if these agencies and brokers fail to market our products successfully  our business may be adversely impacted 
also  independent agents may decide to sell their businesses to banks  other insurance agencies  or other businesses 
agents with our appointment may decide to buy other agents 
changes in ownership of agencies or expansion of agencies through acquisition could adversely affect an agency s ability to control growth and profitability  thereby adversely affecting our business 
in addition to independent insurance agents  we also rely on third party service providers to conduct a portion of our premium audits  safety management services  and claims adjusting services 
hr outsourcing relies on third party service providers for products such as health coverage  flexible spending accounts  and k savings plans 
if these third party service providers fail to perform their respective services and or fail to provide their products successfully and or accurately  our business may be adversely impacted 
we are heavily regulated in the states in which we operate and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth 
we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which the insurance subsidiaries transact insurance business 
the primary purpose of insurance regulation is to protect individual policyholders and not stockholders or other investors 
our business can be adversely affected by regulations affecting property and casualty insurance companies 
for example  laws and regulations can lead to mandated reductions in rates to levels that we do not believe are adequate for the risks we insure 
other laws and regulations limit our ability to cancel or refuse to renew certain policies and require us to offer coverage to all consumers 
changes in laws and regulations  or their interpretations  pertaining to insurance may also have an impact on our business 
our concentration of business may expose us to increased risks of regulatory matters in the states in which the insurance subsidiaries write insurance that could be greater than the risks we could be exposed to by transacting business in a greater number of geographic markets 
although the insurance industry is primarily regulated by individual states and the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance  federal initiatives  such as the nfip  the proposed national insurance act of which would permit an optional federal charter for insurers  the proposed free choice act which would make it easier for workers to unionize  the office of foreign assets control  financial services regulation  privacy regulation and tort reform regulation can also impact the insurance industry and our company 
proposals intended to control the cost and availability of healthcare services have been debated in the us congress and state legislatures 
although we neither write health insurance nor assume any healthcare risk  rules affecting healthcare services can affect workers compensation  commercial and personal automobile  liability  and other insurance that we do write 
we cannot determine whether  or in what form  healthcare reform legislation may be adopted by the us congress or any state legislature or what effect  if any  such adoption would have on us as an insurer or as an employer 
in addition  in view of recent events involving certain financial institutions  it is possible that the us federal government will heighten its oversight of insurers such as us  including possibly through a federal system of insurance regulation 
proposals to create such a federal regulatory system for property and casualty insurers continue to be considered 
we cannot predict whether these or other proposals will be adopted  or what impact  if any  such proposals or  if enacted  such laws  could have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
state laws in the us grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to  among other things insurer solvency standards  insurer and agent licensing  investment restrictions  payment of dividends and distributions  provisions for current losses and future liabilities  deposit of securities for the benefit of policyholders  restrictions on policy terminations  unfair trade practices  and approval of premium rates and policy forms 

table of contents further specific examples of insurance regulatory risks include automobile insurance regulation in  new jersey instituted an urban enterprise zone uez program  which requires new jersey auto insurers to have a market share in certain urban territories that is in proportion to their statewide market share 
due to mandated urban rate caps  the premiums on these uez policies are typically insufficient to cover losses 
although the law that imposed these urban rate caps was repealed in  the caps continue to be enforced by the new jersey department of banking and insurance njdobi 
in an effort to mitigate this rate inadequacy  the njdobi implemented a new territorial rating structure in from time to time  legislative proposals are passed and judicial decisions are rendered related to automobile insurance regulation that could adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  in a new jersey supreme court decision eliminated the application of the serious life impact standard to personal automobile bodily injury liability cases under the verbal tort threshold of new jersey s aicra 
this decision allows claimants to file lawsuits for non economic damages without proving that the injuries sustained had a serious impact on their lives 
workers compensation insurance regulation because we voluntarily write workers compensation insurance  we are required by state law to support the involuntary market 
insurance companies that underwrite voluntary workers compensation insurance can either directly write involuntary coverage  which is assigned by state regulatory authorities  or participate in a sharing arrangement  where the business is written by a servicing carrier and the profits or losses of that serviced business are shared among the participating insurers 
we currently participate through a sharing arrangement in all states 
state laws regulate not only the amounts and types of workers compensation benefits that must be paid to injured workers  but in some instances the premium rates that may be charged by us to insure businesses for those liabilities 
for example  in approximately states  workers compensation insurance rates are set by the state insurance regulators and are adjusted periodically 
historically  monoline workers compensation business has been unprofitable whether written directly or handled through a sharing arrangement 
additionally  we are required to provide workers compensation benefits for losses arising from acts of terrorism under our workers compensation policies 
the impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable  and the ultimate impact on us will depend upon the nature  extent  location  and timing of such an act 
any such impact on us could be material 
homeowners insurance regulation we are subject to regulatory provisions that are designed to address potential availability and or affordability problems in the homeowners property insurance marketplace 
involuntary market mechanisms  such as the new jersey insurance underwriting association new jersey fair plan  generally result in assessments against the insurance subsidiaries 
the new jersey fair plan writes fire and extended coverage on homeowners for those individuals unable to secure insurance elsewhere 
insurance companies who voluntarily write homeowners insurance in new jersey are assessed a portion of any deficit from the new jersey fair plan based on their share of the voluntary market 
similar involuntary plans exist in most other states where we operate 
certain coastal states have instituted  or are considering adopting  legislation or regulation to maintain or increase the availability of property insurance  particularly homeowners insurance  in those states 
as an example  certain states  including certain states in which the insurance subsidiaries transact homeowners insurance business  are considering legislation requiring that insurers that write homeowners insurance in any geographic area of a state must write homeowners insurance in all geographic areas of that state 
we cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulation will be enacted  and the ultimate impact on us will depend upon the specifics of the legislation or regulation and the state or states that adopt any such legislation or regulation 
credit scoring regulation we use certain aspects of credit scores when evaluating individual risks 
in june  the us supreme court interpreted the fair credit reporting act fcra concerning the meaning of the term adverse action as it relates to an insurance carrier s use of credit scoring when it quotes premium for a personal lines applicant or raises premium for an existing personal lines insured 
this interpretation requires insurance carriers to notify policyholders and applicants when their credit reports are the basis for adverse action  such as a rate increase 
an adverse action notification  according to the interpretation  would be required if a quoted rate is higher than it would have been in a credit neutral comparison  which compares the credit score based rate against a credit score neutral rate 
the interpretation does not require an insurance carrier to inform all policyholders that their credit reports have been reviewed in the underwriting process or that the rate they have received is higher than the best possible rate of the carrier 

table of contents in  the federal trade commission ftc asked nine of the largest homeowners insurance companies to provide information it says will allow it to determine how consumer credit data is used by the companies in underwriting and rate setting 
in addition  legislation was introduced that would amend the fcra to prohibit personal lines property casualty insurers from utilizing credit information to underwrite a personal lines policy if the ftc study concludes that insurers use of credit information in underwriting results in racial or ethnic discrimination or represents a proxy or proxy effect for race or ethnicity 
changes to regulation regarding the use of credit scores at either the federal or state level may impact the way in which we price business and or notify policyholders or applicants of adverse actions resulting from the use of these scores 
however  the impact of such a change would apply similarly to all market participants that currently utilize credit scores 
regulation and legislation of agent compensation the insurance subsidiaries sell insurance products and services primarily through appointed independent insurance agents 
accordingly  we seek to compensate our agents consistent with market practices and pay commissions and other consideration for business agents place with the insurance subsidiaries 
we disclose our compensation practices in notices to all policyholders and on our public website  while referring all specific questions about agent compensation to the agent that placed the business with us 
at present  we believe our agent compensation practices and disclosures meet current legal and regulatory requirements 
in recent years  however  certain state attorney generals have investigated various alleged anticompetitive practices engaged in by several insurance brokers and national insurance companies that compete with us 
some of these investigations  mainly related to insureds that are much larger than our target customers  have resulted in consent orders under which brokers and several of our competitors have left uncontested the attorney general s allegations that some of their compensation arrangements may have caused certain brokers to clandestinely steer clients to specific insurers without sufficient disclosure to the client 
the consent orders also have  to one degree or another  banned the use of such compensation arrangements by the offending brokers and insurers in several  but not all  lines of business 
given the regulatory scrutiny of compensation arrangements with brokers to date  it is possible that compensation arrangements between insurers and independent agents will come under further review and will be the subject of public policy debate and possible legislative reform 
we monitor these developments but cannot determine the nature or effect  if any  that such a public policy debate or possible legislative reform will have on our agent compensation practices or business 
reinsurance regulation florida  a state in which we do not write homeowners insurance or private passenger automobile insurance  passed legislation in i changing the funding and operation of the florida state sponsored insurer of last resort  citizens property insurance corporation  and the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf  which is the florida state sponsored reinsurance facility  and ii prohibiting residential property insurers from including in rate calculations the additional costs of private reinsurance or loss exposure that duplicates fhcf coverage 
in the short term  such legislative action may increase overall private property reinsurance availability and reduce our costs outside of florida 
should other states in which we write business enact similar legislation  it is possible that we may not be able to include the costs of reinsurance that we deem appropriate in our rates 
in such an event  we may be forced  if permitted under applicable law  to exit certain markets 
if not permitted to exit such markets  we may face unfair competitive situations  where state sponsored insurers implement rate freezes or decreases 
we face risks as a servicing carrier in the wyo program of the us government s nfip 
we are a servicing carrier in the wyo program of the nfip 
flood insurance is offered through the nfip  which is managed by the mitigation division of fema under the us department of homeland security 
on september   a law was passed to extend the nfip authority to issue new policies  increase coverage on existing policies  and issue renewal policies until march  the nfip currently has borrowing authority established by congress in the amount of billion and  prior to hurricane ike in the third quarter of  had borrowed billion from the us treasury 
fema is currently seeking additional borrowings from the us treasury as the current limitation is expected to only last into the first quarter of we continue to monitor developments with the nfip 

table of contents as a servicing carrier in the wyo program we receive an expense allowance  or servicing fee  for policies written and claims serviced under the wyo program 
effective june   the nfip revised their claim servicing fee structure to provide for fees of of direct premiums written  which are paid even in non catastrophe years  coupled with fees equal to of all incurred losses 
prior to june   we received claims handling fees equal to of all incurred losses 
effective october   the expense allowance for servicing policies written was increased to 
any future changes to the fee structure or the expenses incurred by us to adhere to additional regulatory requirements of the wyo program could have an adverse effect on our operations 
while currently there are no active bills in congress reforming the nfip  we do expect to see legislative activity in it is possible that this federal program could be modified in an unfavorable manner having an adverse effect on our flood results  potentially affecting our continued participation in the program 
changes in tax laws impacting marginal tax rates and or the preferred tax treatment of municipal obligations could adversely impact our business 
tax legislation which changes the tax preference of municipal obligations under current law could adversely affect the market value of municipal obligations 
at december   of our investment portfolio was invested in tax exempt municipal obligations  as such  the value of our investment portfolio could be adversely affected by any such legislation 
additionally  any such changes in tax law could reduce the difference between tax exempt interest rates and taxable rates 
class action litigation could affect our business practices and financial results 
our industries have been the target of class action litigation in areas including the following after market parts  urban homeowner insurance underwriting practices  credit scoring and predictive modeling pricing  investment disclosure  health maintenance organization practices  discounting and payment of personal injury protection claims  and shareholder class action suits 
a change in our market share in new jersey could adversely impact the results of our private passenger automobile business 
new jersey insurance regulations require new jersey auto insurers to involuntarily write private passenger automobile insurance for individuals who are unable to obtain insurance in the voluntary market 
these policies are priced according to a separate rating scheme that is established by the assigned risk plan and subject to approval by njdobi 
the amount of involuntary insurance an insurer must write in new jersey depends on the insurer s statewide market share the greater the market share  the more involuntary coverage the insurer is required to write 
the underwriting of involuntary personal automobile insurance in new jersey has been historically unprofitable 
in addition to the assigned risk plan in new jersey  there are ongoing attempts to address rate disparities between different geographic regions in the state  as well as judicial attempts to address limitations of lawsuits 
in  the njdobi implemented a new territorial rating structure to  in part  address the historical geographic subsidization 
if our market share in new jersey increases it could adversely impact the results of our private passenger automobile business if we are required to write more involuntary coverage 
we depend on key personnel 
to a large extent  the success of our businesses is dependent on our ability to attract and retain key employees  in particular our senior officers  key management  sales  information systems  underwriting  claims  hr outsourcing  and corporate personnel 
competition to attract and retain key personnel is intense 
while we have employment agreements with a number of key managers  we generally do not have employment contracts with our employees and cannot ensure that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel 
in addition  our workforce is older  with an average age of as of december  approximately of our workforce as of december  was retirement eligible under our retirement and benefit plans 

table of contents we face risks from technology related failures 
our businesses are increasingly dependent on computer and internet enabled technology 
our inability to anticipate or manage problems with technology associated with scalability  security  functionality  or reliability could adversely affect our ability to write business and service accounts  and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks in the hr outsourcing business 
selective hr is affected by numerous federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment matters  benefits plans  and taxes 
in performing services for its clients  selective hr assumes some obligations of an employer under these laws and regulations 
regulation in hr outsourcing is constantly evolving  which could result in the modification of laws and regulations from time to time 
we cannot predict what additional government initiatives  if any  affecting selective hr may be promulgated in the future 
consequently  we also cannot predict whether selective hr will be able to adapt to new or modified regulatory requirements or obtain necessary licenses and government approvals 
the severe downturn in the us economy has particularly affected small businesses  which are the core of selective hr s customer base 
selective hr enters into agreements with these small businesses to establish a three party relationship under which selective hr and the small business are co employers of the employees who work at the small business location worksite employees 
as these small businesses continue to feel the strain of liquidity issues  they may i bring in house the services that selective hr provides to them  ii reduce their payrolls  or iii cease to continue their operations all together 
the loss of these worksite employees will adversely affect selective hr s revenues 
furthermore  since selective hr is considered the co employer of their clients employees  the rising unemployment rates in the us will cause deterioration on selective hr s suta margins 
this rise in unemployment rates  coupled with anticipated extensions of unemployment benefits  could put pressure on many states unemployment funds and is anticipated to result in future suta rate increases 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us we employ anti takeover measures that may discourage potential acquirers and could adversely affect the value of the parent common stock 
the parent owns all of the shares of stock of the insurance subsidiaries 
state insurance laws require prior approval by state insurance departments of any acquisition or control of a domestic insurance company or of any company that controls a domestic insurance company 
any purchase of or more of the parent s outstanding common stock would require prior action by all or some of the insurance commissioners of the insurance subsidiaries states of domicile 
other factors also may discourage  delay  or prevent a change of control of us  including  among others  provisions in our certificate of incorporation as amended  relating to supermajority voting and fair price to our business combinations  supermajority voting requirements to amend the foregoing provisions  and the ability of the board to issue blank check preferred stock 
the new jersey shareholders protection act provides that we  as a new jersey corporation  may not engage in business combinations specified in the statute with a shareholder having indirect or direct beneficial ownership of or more of the voting power of the parent s outstanding stock an interested shareholder for a period of five years following the date on which the shareholder became an interested shareholder  unless the business combination is approved by the board of the corporation before the date the shareholder became an interested shareholder 
in addition  we may not engage at any time in any business combination with any interested shareholder other than i a business combination approved by the board prior to the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder  ii a business combination approved by two thirds of our shareholders other than the interested shareholder  or iii a business combination that satisfies certain price criteria 
these provisions also could have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price if a hostile takeover were attempted and may adversely affect the value of the parent s common stock

we believe our facilities provide adequate space for our present needs and that additional space  if needed  would be available on reasonable terms 
item legal proceedings 
in the ordinary course of conducting business  we are named as defendants in various legal proceedings 
most of these proceedings are claims litigation involving the insurance subsidiaries as either  i liability insurers defending or providing indemnity for third party claims brought against insureds  or ii insurers defending first party coverage claims brought against them 
we account for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
we expect that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such ordinary course claims litigation  after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense  will not be material to our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
from time to time  the insurance subsidiaries are also involved in other legal actions  some of which assert claims for substantial amounts 
these actions include  among others  putative state class actions seeking certification of a state or national class 
such putative class actions have alleged  for example  improper reimbursement of medical providers paid under workers compensation and personal and commercial automobile insurance policies 
the insurance subsidiaries are also from time to time involved in individual actions in which extra contractual damages  punitive damages  or penalties are sought  such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims 
we believe that we have valid defenses to these cases and expect that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such lawsuits  after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses  will not be material to our consolidated financial condition 
nonetheless  given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions  and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods
