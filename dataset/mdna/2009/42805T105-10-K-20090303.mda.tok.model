these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described in item a risk factors 
the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe to be relevant to an understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with the sections entitled cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  item a risk factors  item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
overview we are engaged principally in the business of renting cars and renting equipment 
our revenues primarily are derived from rental and related charges and consist of car rental revenues revenues from all company operated car rental operations  including charges to customers for the reimbursement of costs incurred relating to airport concession fees and vehicle license fees  the fueling of vehicles and the sale of loss or collision damage waivers  liability insurance coverage and other products  equipment rental revenues revenues from all company operated equipment rental operations  including amounts charged to customers for the fueling and delivery of equipment and sale of loss damage waivers  and other revenues fees and certain cost reimbursements from our licensees and revenues from our car leasing operations and our third party claim management services 
our equipment rental business also derives revenues from the sale of new equipment and consumables 
our expenses primarily consist of direct operating expenses primarily wages and related benefits  commissions and concession fees paid to airport authorities  travel agents and others  facility  self insurance and reservation costs  the cost of new equipment and consumables purchased for resale  and other costs relating to the operation and rental of revenue earning equipment  such as damage  maintenance and fuel costs  depreciation expense relating to revenue earning equipment including net gains or losses on the disposal of such equipment 
revenue earning equipment includes cars and rental equipment  selling  general and administrative expenses including advertising  and interest expense  net of interest income 
the car and equipment rental industries are significantly influenced by general economic conditions 
in the final three months of  both the car and equipment rental markets experienced unprecedented declines due to the precipitous slowdown in consumer spending as well as significantly reduced demand for industrial and construction equipment 
the car rental industry is also significantly influenced by developments in the travel industry  and  particularly  in airline passenger traffic  while the equipment rental segment is being impacted by the difficult economic and business environment as investment in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued commercial construction and the industrial markets slow 
the united states and international markets are currently experiencing a significant decline in economic activities  including a tightening of the credit markets  reduced airline passenger traffic  reduced consumer spending and volatile fuel prices 
these conditions are expected to continue in during  this resulted in a rapid decline in the volume of car rental and equipment rental transactions  an increase in depreciation and fleet related costs as a percentage of revenue  lower industry pricing and lower residual values for the non program cars and equipment that we sold 
see item a risk factors in this annual report 
our profitability is primarily a function of the volume  mix and pricing of rental transactions and the utilization of cars and equipment 
significant changes in the purchase price or residual values of cars and equipment or interest rates can also have a significant effect on our profitability depending on our ability to adjust pricing for these changes 
in the united states  model year program vehicle depreciation costs rose approximately and per car depreciation costs for model year us non program cars declined as compared to as a consequence of those changes in per car costs  as well as the larger proportion of our us fleet we purchased as non program cars and other actions we took to mitigate program car cost increases  our net per car depreciation costs for model year cars increased by less than from our net per car depreciation costs for model year us cars 
we continue to have an overall strategy of increasing the proportion of non program cars we have in our worldwide fleet 
however in  given the recent economic downturn described above  we sold a higher proportion of non program cars during the third quarter  when the used car market is traditionally stronger  to reduce exposure to residual value declines in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  for the year ended december   the percentage of non program cars in the us fleet decreased from to as compared to the year ended december   however  the percentage of non program cars increased slightly internationally and for the year ended december   the percentage of non program cars in our international fleet was  compared to for the year ended december  our per car vehicle depreciation costs in the united states for increased approximately from our net per car depreciation costs for and increased approximately in europe year over year 
we expect our per car vehicle depreciation costs in the united states and in europe for to be similar to our business requires significant expenditures for cars and equipment  and consequently we require substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
our car rental and equipment rental operations are seasonal businesses  with decreased levels of business in the winter months and heightened activity during the spring and summer 
we have the ability to dynamically manage fleet capacity  the most significant portion of our cost structure  to meet market demand 
for instance  to accommodate increased demand  we increase our available fleet and staff during the second and third quarters of the year 
as business demand declines  fleet and staff are decreased accordingly 
a number of our other major operating costs  including airport concession fees  commissions and vehicle liability expenses  are directly related to revenues or transaction volumes 
in addition  our management expects to utilize enhanced process improvements  including efficiency initiatives and the use of our information technology systems  to help manage our variable costs 
approximately two thirds of our typical annual operating costs represent variable costs  while the remaining one third is fixed or semi fixed 
we also maintain a flexible workforce  with a significant number of part time and seasonal workers 
however  certain operating expenses  including minimum concession fees  rent  insurance  and administrative overhead  remain fixed and cannot be adjusted for seasonal demand 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as part of our ongoing effort to implement our strategy of reducing operating costs  we are evaluating our workforce and operations and making adjustments  including headcount reductions and business process reengineering to optimize work flow at rental locations and maintenance facilities as well as streamlining our back office operations and evaluating potential outsourcing opportunities 
when we make adjustments to our workforce and operations  we may incur incremental expenses that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce and operating structure  but we believe that increasing our operating efficiency and reducing the costs associated with the operation of our business are important to our long term competitiveness 
in early  we announced several initiatives to further improve our competitiveness and industry leadership through targeted job reductions affecting approximately employees primarily at our corporate headquarters in park ridge  new jersey and our us service center in oklahoma city  oklahoma  and approximately  employees primarily in our us car rental operations  with much smaller reductions occurring in our us equipment rental operations  as well as in canada  puerto rico  brazil  australia and new zealand 
in june  we announced targeted reductions affecting approximately positions in our us car and equipment rental operations  as well as financial and reservations related positions in our us service center in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
during  we began to implement cost saving initiatives in our european operations  and we continued implementation of these measures in additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we finalized or substantially completed contract terms with industry leading service providers to outsource select functions globally  relating to real estate facilities management and construction  procurement and information technology 
the contracts related to these outsourced functions were completed during the first quarter of in the first quarter of  to continue improving our competitiveness and industry position  we initiated job reductions affecting approximately employees in our us and european car rental operations with much smaller reductions occurring in our us equipment rental operations  the corporate headquarters in park ridge  new jersey  and the us service center in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
in late may and june  our us equipment rental business initiated the closure of branch operations across the united states to gain further operating efficiencies 
this initiative resulted in severance costs for approximately employees whose positions were eliminated  asset impairment charges for surplus equipment identified for disposal  recognition of future facility lease obligations and the impairment of related leasehold improvements 
additionally  in the second quarter of  we implemented other cost containment and efficiency initiatives resulting in approximately additional employee reductions 
during the third quarter of  our equipment rental business incurred charges for asset impairments  losses on disposal of surplus equipment and recognition of future facility lease obligations related to branch closures in the us and europe 
our us car rental business  in order to streamline operations and reduce costs  initiated the closure of off airport locations and incurred a charge related to facility lease obligations 
additionally  to address the challenging economic environment  we introduced a voluntary employment separation program in our us operations as well as initiating involuntary employee severance actions globally 
the third quarter restructuring charges included employee termination liabilities covering approximately  employees 
during the fourth quarter of  our north american and european car rental businesses  in order to further streamline operations and reduce costs  initiated the closure of approximately off airport locations 
related to these location closures  as well as the elimination of several more equipment rental branches in the us and europe  we incurred charges for asset impairments  losses on disposal of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued surplus vehicles and equipment and recognition of future facility lease obligations for those locations vacated by year end 
the locations closed were strategically selected to enable us to continue to provide our rental services from other locations in the same area to our loyal customer base 
we will continue to assess the effectiveness  size and geographical presence of our global network footprint and may make adjustments as warranted 
in january  we announced that  as part of a comprehensive plan to further decrease costs and as a result of reduced rental demand  we were reducing our global workforce by more than  employees beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing through the first quarter of  more than half of whom are not eligible for severance benefits 
we expect job reductions in the car and equipment rental businesses  corporate and support areas  and in all geographies  with an emphasis on eliminating non customer facing jobs 
related to these location closures and continued cost reduction initiatives  we incurred restructuring charges for employee termination liabilities covering approximately  employee separations in the fourth quarter 
for the years ended december  and  our consolidated statement of operations includes restructuring charges relating to the initiatives discussed above of million and million  respectively 
additional efficiency and cost saving initiatives may be developed during however  we presently do not have firm plans or estimates of any related expenses 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
for the year ended december   based on publicly available information  we believe some us car rental companies experienced declines in transaction days and rental rate revenue per transaction day  or rpd  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   in the united states  we experienced a decrease in transaction days and a decrease in rpd versus during the year ended december   in our european operations  we experienced a low to mid single digit increase in transaction days and a low to mid single digit decrease in rpd versus in the three years ended december   we increased the number of our off airport rental locations in the united states by approximately to approximately  locations 
revenues from our us off airport operations grew during the same period  representing million  million and million of our total car rental revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in and subsequent years  our strategy will include selected openings of new off airport locations  the disciplined evaluation of existing locations and the pursuit of same store sales growth 
our strategy includes increasing penetration in the off airport market and growing the online leisure market  particularly in the longer length weekly sector  which is characterized by lower vehicle costs and lower transaction costs at a lower rpd 
increasing our penetration in these sectors is consistent with our long term strategy to generate profitable growth 
when we open a new off airport location  we incur a number of costs  including those relating to site selection  lease negotiation  recruitment of employees  selection and development of managers  initial sales activities and integration of our systems with those of the companies who will reimburse the location s replacement renters for their rentals 
a new off airport location  once opened  takes time to generate its full potential revenues and  as a result  revenues at new locations do not initially cover their start up costs and often do not  for some time  cover the costs of their ongoing operations 
for the year ended december   we believe equipment rental industry pricing  improved in the united states  canada  france and spain 
for the years ended december  and  based on publicly available information  we believe the us equipment rental industry experienced downward item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued pricing 
herc experienced higher equipment rental volumes and pricing worldwide for the years ended december  and  with pricing increases in attributable to higher price activity in canada and europe offsetting lower price activity in the us herc experienced lower equipment rental volumes and pricing worldwide for the year ended december  during the years ended december   and excluding additions relating to acquisitions  herc had a net increase of eight and six and a net decrease of us locations  respectively  two  one and two new canadian location s  respectively  and seven  seven and a net decrease of locations in europe  respectively  and one location opening in china in in connection with new location openings in the us  we expect herc will incur non fleet start up costs of approximately million per location and additional fleet acquisition costs  excluding equipment transferred from other branches  over an initial twelve month period of approximately to million per location 
in connection with new location openings in europe  we expect herc will incur lower start up costs per location as compared with the united states 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and changes in these judgments and estimates may impact our future results of operations and financial condition 
for additional discussion of our accounting policies  see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
revenue earning equipment our principal assets are revenue earning equipment  which represented approximately of our total assets as of december  revenue earning equipment consists of vehicles utilized in our car rental operations and equipment utilized in our equipment rental operations 
for the year ended december   of the vehicles purchased for our combined us and international car rental fleets were subject to repurchase by automobile manufacturers under contractual repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs  subject to certain manufacturers car condition and mileage requirements  at a specific price during a specified time period 
these programs limit our residual risk with respect to vehicles purchased under these programs 
for all other vehicles  as well as equipment acquired by our equipment rental business  we use historical experience and monitor market conditions to set depreciation rates 
when revenue earning equipment is acquired  we estimate the period that we will hold the asset  primarily based on historical measures of the amount of rental activity eg  automobile mileage and equipment usage and the targeted age of equipment at the time of disposal 
we also estimate the residual value of the applicable revenue earning equipment at the expected time of disposal 
the residual values for rental vehicles are affected by many factors  including make  model and options  age  physical condition  mileage  sale location  time of the year and channel of disposition eg  auction  retail  dealer direct 
the residual value for rental equipment is affected by factors which include equipment age and amount of usage 
depreciation is recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated holding period 
depreciation rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis based on management s ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions  their effect on item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued residual values at the time of disposal and the estimated holding periods 
market conditions for used vehicle and equipment sales can also be affected by external factors such as the economy  natural disasters  fuel prices and incentives offered by manufacturers of new cars 
these key factors are considered when estimating future residual values and assessing depreciation rates 
as a result of this ongoing assessment  we make periodic adjustments to depreciation rates of revenue earning equipment in response to changed market conditions 
upon disposal of revenue earning equipment  depreciation expense is adjusted for the difference between the net proceeds received and the remaining net book value 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
public liability and property damage the obligation for public liability and property damage on self insured us and international vehicles and equipment represents an estimate for both reported accident claims not yet paid  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
the related liabilities are recorded on a non discounted basis 
reserve requirements are based on actuarial evaluations of historical accident claim experience and trends  as well as future projections of ultimate losses  expenses  premiums and administrative costs 
the adequacy of the liability is regularly monitored based on evolving accident claim history and insurance related state legislation changes 
if our estimates change or if actual results differ from these assumptions  the amount of the recorded liability is adjusted to reflect these results 
our actual results as compared to our estimates have historically resulted in relatively minor adjustments to our recorded liability 
pensions our employee pension costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension costs and obligations 
the various employee related actuarial assumptions eg  retirement rates  mortality rates  salary growth used in determining pension costs and plan liabilities are reviewed periodically by management  assisted by the enrolled actuary  and updated as warranted 
the discount rate used to value the pension liabilities and related expenses and the expected rate of return on plan assets are the two most significant assumptions impacting pension expense 
the discount rate used is an actual market based spot rate as of the valuation date 
for the expected return on assets assumption  we use a forward looking rate that is based on the expected return for each asset class including the value added by active investment management  weighted by the target asset allocation 
the past annualized long term performance of the plans assets has generally exceeded the long term rate of return assumption 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable  and also review goodwill annually in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested at least annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the cash flows represent management s most recent planning assumptions 
these assumptions are based on a combination of industry outlooks  views on general economic conditions  our expected pricing plans and expected future savings generated by our ongoing restructuring activities 
if a potential impairment is identified  the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss 
a significant decline in the projected cash flows or a change in the weighted average cost of capital used to determine fair value could result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter  we performed our annual impairment analysis based upon market data as of october  in addition  we performed an additional analysis as of december  due to the fact that there had been a decline in operating results and worldwide economies  and a decline in both the fair value of our debt and our stock price 
we performed the impairment analyses for our reporting units  using our business and long term strategic plans  revised to reflect the current economic conditions 
our weighted average cost of capital used in the discounted cash flow model was calculated based upon the fair value of our debt and our stock price with a debt to equity ratio comparable to our industry 
the total fair value of our reporting units was then compared to our market capitalization to ensure their reasonableness 
for those reporting units which failed the first step of the analysis  fair values were obtained for long lived assets and intangibles 
the fair value of our debt was calculated based upon current market rates and deferred taxes were calculated for our intangible asset impairment charges discussed below 
based upon the comparison of the fair value of equity to the fair value of our assets and liabilities  we concluded that impairment of all of the goodwill for these reporting units existed 
this resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of the acquisition  we also have recognized significant intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we re evaluate the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets annually or as circumstances change 
those intangible assets considered to have indefinite useful lives  including our trade name  are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying value 
in addition  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of intangible assets might not be recoverable  we will perform an impairment review 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the valuation of our indefinite lived assets utilized the relief from royalty method  which incorporates cash flows and discount rates comparable to those discussed above 
the royalty rates utilized in this valuation were based on actual licensing agreements 
we also considered the excess earnings as a percentage of revenues to ensure their reasonableness 
our analysis resulted in an impairment charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter of as of december   our goodwill and other intangible assets had remaining carrying values of million and  million  respectively 
we will continue to monitor the market conditions and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued assess whether a future triggering event occurs  which would result in an additional impairment analysis in the future 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
derivatives we periodically enter into cash flow and other hedging transactions to specifically hedge exposure to various risks related to interest rates and foreign currency rates 
derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and historically have not been used for speculative or trading purposes 
all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value 
the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion is recognized currently in earnings within the same line item as the hedged item  based upon the nature of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments that are not part of a qualified hedging relationship  the changes in their fair value are recognized currently in earnings 
the valuation methods used to mark these to market are either market quotes for foreign exchange instruments or a discounted cash flow method for interest rate swaps 
the key inputs for the discounted cash flow method are the current yield curve and the credit default swap spread 
these are subject to change based on movements in items such as the london inter bank offered rate  or libor  and our credit worthiness 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
subsequent changes to enacted tax rates and changes to the global mix of earnings will result in changes to the tax rates used to calculate deferred taxes and any related valuation allowances 
provisions are not made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states or are expected to be remitted free of taxes 
future distributions  if any  from these international subsidiaries to the united states or changes in us tax rules may require a change to reflect tax on these amounts

stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  revised its sfas  no 
 with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the revised statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is to be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we have accounted for our employee stock based compensation awards in accordance with sfas no 
r 
we estimated the fair value of options issued at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model  which includes item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued assumptions related to volatility  expected term  dividend yield  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
these factors combined with the stock price on the date of grant result in a fixed expense which is recorded on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the key factors used in the valuation process  other than the forfeiture rate  remained unchanged from the date of grant 
because the stock of hertz holdings became publicly traded in november and has a short trading history  it is not practicable for us to estimate the expected volatility of our share price  or a peer company share price  because there is not sufficient historical information about past volatility 
therefore  we use the calculated value method to estimate the expected volatility  based on the dow jones specialized consumer services sub sector within the consumer services industry  and we use the us large capitalization component  which includes the top of the index universe by market value 
because historical exercise data does not exist  and because we meet the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no 
 we use the simplified method for estimating the expected term 
we believe it is appropriate to continue to use this simplified method because we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term due to the limited period of time our common stock has been publicly traded 
the assumed dividend yield is zero 
the risk free interest rate is the implied zero coupon yield for us treasury securities having a maturity approximately equal to the expected term of the options  as of the grant dates 
we assume that in each year  of the options that are outstanding but not vested will be forfeited  based on our us pension plan withdrawal rate assumptions 
considering the company s brief history of issuing stock options and higher than average recent employee turnover  especially among option holders  we will assess next year if a change in this assumption is warranted 
the non cash stock based compensation expense associated with the hertz global holdings  inc stock incentive plan  or the stock incentive plan  the hertz global holdings  inc director stock incentive plan  or the director plan  and omnibus plan  are pushed down from hertz holdings and recorded on the books at the hertz level

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations in the following discussion  comparisons are made between the years ended december   and the following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by the various line items in our consolidated statements of operations in millions of dollars percentage of revenues years ended december  years ended december  revenues car rental equipment rental other total revenues expenses direct operating depreciation of revenue earning equipment selling  general and administrative interest  net of interest income impairment charges total expenses income loss before income taxes and minority interest provision benefit for taxes on income minority interest net income loss item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table sets forth certain of our selected car rental  equipment rental and other operating data for each of the periods indicated years ended  or as of december  selected car rental operating data worldwide number of transactions in thousands domestic international worldwide transaction days in thousands a domestic international worldwide rental rate revenue per transaction day b domestic international worldwide average number of company operated cars during the period domestic international adjusted pre tax income in millions of dollars c worldwide revenue earning equipment  net in millions of dollars selected worldwide equipment rental operating data rental and rental related revenue in millions of dollars d same store revenue growth  including growth initiatives e average acquisition cost of rental equipment operated during the period in millions of dollars adjusted pre tax income in millions of dollars c revenue earning equipment  net in millions of dollars other operating data cash flows from operating activities in million of dollars ebitda in millions of dollars f corporate ebitda in millions of dollars f a transaction days represents the total number of days that vehicles were on rent in a given period 
b car rental rate revenue consists of all revenue  net of discounts  associated with the rental of cars including charges for optional insurance products  but excluding revenue derived from fueling and concession and other expense pass throughs  neverlost units in the us and certain ancillary revenue 
rental rate revenue per transaction day is calculated as total rental rate revenue  divided by the total number of transaction days  with all periods adjusted to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency 
our management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends 
this statistic is important to our management as it represents the best measurement of the changes in underlying pricing in the car rental business and encompasses the elements in car rental pricing that management has the ability to control 
the optional insurance products are packaged within certain negotiated corporate  government and membership programs and within certain retail rates being charged 
based upon these existing programs and rate packages  management believes that these optional insurance products should be consistently included in the daily pricing of car rental transactions 
on the other hand  non rental rate revenue items such as refueling and concession pass through expense items are driven by factors beyond the control of management ie the price of fuel and the concession fees charged by airports 
additionally  neverlost units are an optional revenue product which management does not consider to be part of their daily pricing of car rental transactions 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table reconciles our car rental revenue to our rental rate revenue and rental rate revenue per transaction day based on december  foreign exchange rates for the years ended december   and in millions of dollars  except as noted years ended december  car rental revenue per statement of operations non rental rate revenue foreign currency adjustment rental rate revenue transaction days in thousands rental rate revenue per transaction day in whole dollars c adjusted pre tax income is calculated as income before income taxes and minority interest plus non cash purchase accounting charges  non cash debt charges relating to the amortization of deferred debt financing costs and debt discounts and certain one time charges and non operational items 
adjusted pre tax income is the measure utilized by management in making decisions about allocating resources to segments and measuring their performance 
management believes this measure best reflects the financial results from ongoing operations

d equipment rental and rental related revenue consists of all revenue  net of discounts  associated with the rental of equipment including charges for delivery  loss damage waivers and fueling  but excluding revenue arising from the sale of equipment  parts and supplies and certain other ancillary revenue 
rental and rental related revenue is adjusted in all periods to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency 
our management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends 
this statistic is important to our management as it is utilized in the measurement of rental revenue generated per dollar invested in fleet on an annualized basis and is comparable with the reporting of other industry participants

the same store revenue amounts are adjusted in all periods to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency 
our management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends 
f we present ebitda and corporate ebitda to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and liquidity and  in the case of corporate ebitda  information utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants under our senior credit facilities 
ebitda  as used in this annual report  is defined as consolidated net income before net interest expense  consolidated income taxes and consolidated depreciation and amortization 
corporate ebitda differs from the term ebitda as it is commonly used 
corporate ebitda  as used in this annual report  means ebitda as that term is item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued defined under our senior credit facilities  which is generally consolidated net income before net interest expense other than interest expense relating to certain car rental fleet financing  consolidated income taxes  consolidated depreciation other than depreciation related to the car rental fleet and amortization and before certain other items  in each case as more fully defined in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities 
the other items excluded in this calculation include  but are not limited to non cash expenses and charges  extraordinary  unusual or non recurring gains or losses  gains or losses associated with the sale or write down of assets not in the ordinary course of business  certain management fees paid to the sponsors in  and earnings to the extent of cash dividends or distributions paid from non controlled affiliates 
further  the covenants in our senior credit facilities are calculated using corporate ebitda for the most recent four fiscal quarters as a whole 
as a result  the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter 
further  it may not be comparable to the measure for any subsequent four quarter period or for any complete fiscal year 
management uses ebitda and corporate ebitda as performance and cash flow metrics for internal monitoring and planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget and monthly operating reviews  as well as to facilitate analysis of investment decisions 
in addition  both metrics are important to allow us to evaluate profitability and make performance trend comparisons between us and our competitors 
further  we believe ebitda and corporate ebitda are frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industries 
ebitda is also used by management and investors to evaluate our operating performance exclusive of financing costs and depreciation policies 
further  because we have two business segments that are financed differently and have different underlying depreciation characteristics  ebitda enables investors to isolate the effects on profitability of operating metrics such as revenue  operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition to its use to monitor performance trends  ebitda provides a comparative metric to management and investors that is consistent across companies with different capital structures and depreciation policies 
this enables management and investors to compare our performance on a consolidated basis and on a segment basis to that of our peers 
in addition  our management uses consolidated ebitda as a proxy for cash flow available to finance fleet expenditures and the costs of our capital structure on a day to day basis so that we can more easily monitor our cash flows when a full statement of cash flows is not available 
corporate ebitda also serves as an important measure of our performance 
corporate ebitda for our car rental segment enables us to assess our operating performance inclusive of fleet management performance  depreciation assumptions and the cost of financing our fleet 
in addition  corporate ebitda for our car rental segment allows us to compare our performance  inclusive of fleet mix and financing decisions  to the performance of our competitors 
since most of our competitors utilize asset backed fleet debt to finance fleet acquisitions  this measure is relevant for evaluating our operating efficiency inclusive of our fleet acquisition and utilization 
for our equipment rental segment  corporate ebitda provides an appropriate measure of performance because the investment in our equipment fleet is longer term in nature than for our car rental segment and  therefore  corporate ebitda allows management to assess operating performance exclusive of interim changes in depreciation assumptions 
further  unlike our car rental segment  our equipment rental fleet is not financed through separate securitization based fleet financing facilities  but rather through our corporate debt 
corporate ebitda for our equipment rental segment is a key measure used to make investment decisions because it enables us to evaluate return on investments 
for both segments  corporate ebitda provides a relevant profitability metric for use in comparison of our performance against our public peers  many of whom publicly disclose a comparable metric 
in addition  we believe that investors  analysts and rating agencies consider ebitda and corporate ebitda useful in measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make capital expenditures 
several of our material debt covenants are based on financial ratios utilizing corporate ebitda and non compliance with those covenants could result in the requirement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under those agreements  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
ebitda and corporate ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap 
when evaluating our operating performance or liquidity  investors should not consider ebitda and corporate ebitda in isolation of  or as a substitute for  measures of our financial performance and liquidity as determined in accordance with gaap  such as net income  operating income or net cash provided by operating activities 
ebitda and corporate ebitda may have material limitations as performance measures because they exclude items that are necessary elements of our costs and operations 
because other companies may calculate ebitda and corporate ebitda differently than we do  ebitda may not be  and corporate ebitda as presented in this annual report is not  comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
borrowings under our senior credit facilities are a key source of our liquidity 
our ability to borrow under these senior credit facilities depends upon  among other things  the maintenance of a sufficient borrowing base and compliance with the financial ratio covenants based on corporate ebitda set forth in the credit agreements for our senior credit facilities 
our senior term loan facility requires us to maintain a specified consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated interest expense coverage ratio based on corporate ebitda  while our senior asset based loan facility requires that a specified consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio be maintained for periods during which there is less than million of available borrowing capacity under the senior asset based loan facility 
these financial covenants became applicable to us beginning september   reflecting the four quarter period ending thereon 
failure to comply with item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued these financial ratio covenants would result in a default under the credit agreements for our senior credit facilities and  absent a waiver or an amendment from the lenders  permit the acceleration of all outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facilities 
as of december   we performed the calculations associated with the above noted financial covenants and determined that we are in compliance with such covenants 
as of december   we had an aggregate principal amount outstanding of  million pursuant to our senior term loan facility and no amounts outstanding of our senior asset based loan facility  respectively 
as of december   hertz is required under the senior term loan facility to have a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than and a consolidated interest expense coverage ratio of not less than in addition  under our senior asset based loan facility  if there is less than million of available borrowing capacity under that facility as of december   hertz is required to have a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than for the quarter then ended 
under the senior term loan facility  as of december   we had a consolidated leverage ratio of and a consolidated interest expense coverage ratio of since we have maintained sufficient borrowing capacity under our senior asset based loan facility as of december   and expect to maintain such capacity in the future  the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was not deemed relevant for presentation 
for further information on the terms of our senior credit facilities  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
in addition to the borrowings under our senior credit facilities  we have a significant amount of additional debt outstanding

the increase in restricted cash of million from december  to december   primarily related to the timing of purchases and sales of revenue earning vehicles 
our domestic and international operations are funded by cash provided by operating activities and by extensive financing arrangements maintained by us in the united states  europe  puerto rico  australia  new zealand  canada and brazil 
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was  million  a decrease of million from the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the current year net loss and decreases in the year over year changes in receivables and accounts payable  partly offset by an increase in depreciation of revenue earning equipment 
our primary use of cash in investing activities is for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment  which consists of cars and equipment 
in addition  we and our affiliates may from time to time repurchase or otherwise retire debt of our subsidiaries and take other steps to reduce such debt or otherwise improve our balance sheet 
these actions may include open market repurchases  negotiated repurchases and other retirements of outstanding debt 
the amount of debt that may be repurchased or otherwise retired  if any  will depend on market conditions  trading levels of such debt from time to time  our cash position and other considerations 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was  million  a decrease of million from the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in revenue earning equipment expenditures  partly offset by a decrease in proceeds from the disposal of revenue earning equipment 
for the year ended december   our expenditures for revenue earning equipment were  million  partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of such equipment of  million 
these assets are purchased by us in accordance with the terms of programs negotiated with the car and equipment manufacturers 
for the year ended december   our capital expenditures for property and non revenue earning equipment were million and our proceeds from the disposal of such equipment were million 
for the year ended december   net expenditures for revenue earning equipment decreased as compared to this decrease was due to a decrease in year over year expenditures for revenue earning equipment  partly offset by a year over year decrease in disposal proceeds relating to revenue earning equipment 
for the year ended december   net expenditures for property and equipment were higher than our net expenditures in relating to a decrease in disposal proceeds  partly offset by a decrease in year over year expenditures 
for the full year  we expect the level of net expenditures for revenue earning equipment  property and non revenue earning equipment to be lower than the full year see capital expenditures below 
our car rental and equipment rental operations are seasonal businesses with decreased levels of business in the winter months and typically heightened activity during the spring and summer 
this is particularly true of our airport car rental operations and our equipment rental operations 
to accommodate increased demand  we maintain a larger fleet by holding vehicles and equipment and purchasing additional fleet which increases our financing requirements in the second and third quarters of the year 
these seasonal financing needs are funded by increasing the utilization of our various corporate and fleet credit facilities and the variable funding notes portion of our us fleet debt facilities 
as business demand moderates during the winter  we reduce our fleet accordingly and dispose of vehicles and equipment 
the disposal proceeds are used to reduce debt 
we are highly leveraged and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs arises from debt service on indebtedness incurred in connection with the transactions and from the funding of our costs of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operations  working capital and capital expenditures 
based on december  availability and our business plan  we believe we have sufficient liquidity in our existing fleet facilities to meet our debt maturities 
we are beginning discussions with banks and lenders to review refinancing options for the indebtedness maturing in the agreements governing our indebtedness require us to comply with two key covenants based on a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest expense coverage ratio 
these covenants are described further in results of operations and note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under caption item financial statements and supplemental data 
our failure to comply with the obligations contained in any agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under the applicable instrument  which could result in the related debt becoming immediately due and payable and could further result in a cross default or cross acceleration of our debt issued under other instruments 
in response to the economic downturn  in we implemented aggressive strategic actions to reduce costs and improve liquidity 
these actions included reducing wage and benefit costs through significant headcount reductions  accelerating fleet deletions and delaying additions to right size the fleet to current demand levels and rationalizing our location footprint by closing a number of locations 
we have developed additional plans for in an effort to mitigate the impact of continued revenue declines on our results of operations  including further reducing costs through the recently announced additional headcount reductions  continuing to right size our car and equipment rental fleet in response to the economic conditions  continued reengineering of our processes to reduce costs  increasing pricing and continuing to reduce the cost of acquiring our car and equipment rental fleet  among other actions 
we believe these actions will enhance our liquidity going forward 
as of december   we had approximately billion of liquidity  comprised of billion in unrestricted cash  billion in unfunded corporate debt capacity and billion in unfunded fleet debt capacity 
taking into consideration the borrowing base limitations in our senior abl facility and in our fleet debt  the amount that we had available for immediate use as of december  under our senior abl facility was billion and we had billion of over enhancement that was available under our fleet debt  as well as the billion in unrestricted cash 
future availability of borrowings under these facilities will depend on borrowing base requirements and other factors  many of which are outside our control 
as of december   we had approximately  million of total indebtedness outstanding 
cash paid for interest during the year ended december   was million  net of amounts capitalized 
a significant number of cars that we purchase are subject to repurchase by car manufacturers under contractual repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs 
under these programs  car manufacturers agree to repurchase cars at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the cars during a specified time period  typically subject to certain car condition and mileage requirements 
we use this specified price or guaranteed depreciation rate to calculate our asset backed financing capacity 
if any manufacturer of our cars fails to fulfill its repurchase or guaranteed depreciation obligations  due to bankruptcy or otherwise  our asset backed financing capacity could be decreased  or we may be required to materially increase the enhancement levels regarding the fleet vehicles provided by such bankrupt manufacturer under certain of our fleet financing facilities 
for a discussion of risks related to the repurchase of program cars from us or the guarantee of the depreciation rate of program cars by the manufacturers of our cars  see item a risk factors risks related to our business we face risks related to decreased acquisition or disposition of cars through repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs 
in addition for a discussion of the risks associated with a manufacturer s bankruptcy or our reliance on asset backed financing  see item a risk factors item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risks related to our business we could be harmed by a further decline in the results of operations or financial condition of the manufacturers of our cars 
and risks related to our substantial indebtedness our reliance on asset backed financing to purchase cars subjects us to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control 
we rely significantly on asset backed financing to purchase cars for our domestic and international car rental fleets 
for further information concerning our asset backed financing programs  see financing below 
the amount of financing available to us pursuant to these programs depends on a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in the past several years  ford and general motors  which are the principal suppliers of cars to us on both a program and non program basis  have experienced deterioration in their operating results and significant declines in their credit ratings 
in the fall of  ford and general motors approached the us congress to request assistance from the federal government in order to fund their continuing operations 
subsequent to that request  the federal government has provided some assistance to general motors 
in addition  general motors has presented its reorganization plan to the us government  requesting additional funds 
while ford has publicly stated that it does not intend to seek such assistance  there can be no assurance that it will not do so in the future 
if the federal government does not provide such assistance  one or both of these manufacturers could commence bankruptcy reorganization proceedings 
in the event of a bankruptcy of a car manufacturer  including ford or general motors  our liquidity would be impacted by several factors including reductions in fleet residual values  as discussed above  and the risk that we would be unable to collect outstanding receivables due to us from such bankrupt manufacturer 
in addition  under the current terms of our asset backed financing facilities  we may be required to materially increase the enhancement levels regarding the fleet vehicles provided by such bankrupt manufacturer 
if we were required to provide this additional enhancement  we would use a combination of our available cash  our availability under our senior abl facility or any existing over enhancement that we may then have under our fleet financing facilities  which  in the case of ford or general motors would have a material impact on our liquidity 
for a detailed description of the amounts we have available under our senior abl facility and our fleet financing facilities  see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under caption item financial statements and supplemental data 
for a discussion of the risks associated with a manufacturer s bankruptcy or our reliance on asset backed financing  see item a risk factors risks related to our business we could be harmed by a further decline in the results of operations or financial condition of the manufacturers of our cars 
and risks related to our substantial indebtedness our reliance on asset backed financing to purchase cars subjects us to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control 
also  substantially all of our revenue earning equipment and certain related assets are owned by special purpose entities  or are subject to liens in favor of our lenders under the senior abl facility  the us abs program  the international fleet debt facilities  the international abs fleet financing facility  the fleet financing facilities relating to our car rental fleets in hawaii  kansas  puerto rico and st 
thomas  the us virgin islands  brazil  canada  belgium  and our us leveraged financing facility 
substantially all our other assets in the united states are also subject to liens in favor of our lenders under the senior credit facilities  and substantially all of our other assets outside the united states are with certain limited exceptions subject to liens in favor of our lenders under the international fleet debt facilities  the international abs fleet financing facility or in the case of our canadian equipment rental business the senior abl facility 
none of such assets will be available to satisfy the claims of our general creditors 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we have a significant amount of debt that will mature over the next several years 
the aggregate amounts of maturities of debt in millions of dollars are as follows   including  of other short term borrowings          after   for a discussion of these maturities  see contractual obligations 
the approximately billion of short term borrowings included in the maturity are revolving in nature and do not permanently expire in as a result of strategic cost reduction actions taken in and planned for  we believe that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants and that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under various liquidity facilities will be adequate to permit us to meet our debt service obligations  ongoing costs of operations  working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements for the next year and beyond 
our future financial and operating performance  ability to service or refinance our debt and ability to comply with covenants and restrictions contained in our debt agreements will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
recent turmoil in the credit markets and the financial instability of insurance companies providing financial guarantees for asset backed securities has reduced the availability of debt financing  which may result in increases in the interest rates at which lenders are willing to make debt financing available to us 
the impact of such an increase would be more significant than it would be for some other companies because of our substantial debt

our us fleet debt in the amount of approximately billion at december  is guaranteed by third party insurance companies  mbia insurance corporation  or mbia and ambac assurance corporation  or ambac 
mbia and ambac are facing financial instability and have been downgraded and are on review for further credit downgrade or under developing outlook by one or more credit agencies 
an event of bankruptcy with respect to mbia or ambac would result in an amortization event under the portion of the debt guaranteed by the affected insurer 
in addition  if an amortization event continues for days or longer  the noteholders of the affected series of notes would have the right to require liquidation of a portion of the fleet sufficient to repay such notes  provided that the exercise of the right was exercised by a majority of the affected noteholders 
based on current information we do not currently believe that there is a near term risk of bankruptcy of mbia or ambac  nor do we expect the noteholders to exercise their liquidation right in the event of a bankruptcy 
however  in the event of a bankruptcy of either mbia or ambac and subsequent vote by the noteholders to liquidate that portion of our fleet  we would expect to use the portion of our million asset backed facility that is not insured by mbia or ambac that is then available  together with our corporate liquidity and possibly other funding sources  including car and equipment sales  to repay the affected series of notes 
for a discussion of risks related to the financial instability of mbia or ambac  see item a risk factors risks relating to our substantial indebtedness the third party insurance companies that provide credit enhancements in the form of financial guarantees of us fleet debt could face financial instability due to factors beyond our control 
certain events  such as a bankruptcy of one of the third party insurance companies providing financial guarantees with respect to our asset backed notes or a manufacturer of a significant number of cars in our fleet  or a continuing deterioration in the economic environment could lead to a deterioration in our financial condition and liquidity position 
in addition  although we believe it unlikely  in the case of the bankruptcy of a combination of general motors  ford  mbia or ambac  if our available cash and other funding sources were not sufficient to satisfy the consequences as described in note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under caption item financial statements and supplemental data  we would be required to renegotiate with our lenders or raise additional funds and there is no assurance that we would be successful in such renegotiation or the raising of such funds

on the closing date  hvf  as issuer  issued approximately  million of new medium term asset backed notes consisting of classes of notes in two series under the abs supplement  the net proceeds of which were used to finance the purchase of vehicles from related entities and the repayment or cancellation of existing debt 
hvf also issued approximately  million of variable funding notes in two series  none of which were funded at closing 
as of december    million were outstanding in the form of these medium term notes and million were outstanding in the form of variable funding notes 
each class of notes has an expected final payment date approximately three  four or five years from the closing date 
the variable funding notes will be funded through the bank multi seller commercial paper market 
the assets of hvf  including the us car rental fleet owned by hvf and certain related assets  collateralize the us fleet debt and pre acquisition abs notes 
consequently  these assets will not be available to satisfy the claims of our general creditors 
the various series of us fleet debt have either fixed or floating rates of interest 
the interest rate per annum applicable to any floating rate notes other than any variable funding asset backed debt is based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to one month libor plus a spread  although hvf intends to maintain hedging transactions so that it will not be required to pay a rate in excess of per annum in order to receive the libor amounts due from time to time on such floating rate notes 
the interest rate per annum applicable to any variable funding asset backed debt is either the blended average commercial paper rate  if funded through the commercial paper market  or if commercial paper is not being issued  the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate  or if requisite notice is provided  the eurodollar rate plus a spread

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued mbia and ambac provide credit enhancements in the form of financial guarantees for our us fleet debt  with each providing guarantees for approximately half of the billion in principal amount of the notes that was outstanding as of december  under our abs program 
under these arrangements  either mbia or ambac will guarantee the timely payment of interest on and ultimate payment of principal of such notes 
an event of bankruptcy as defined in the indentures governing the us fleet debt with respect to mbia or ambac would constitute an amortization event under the portion of the us fleet debt facilities guaranteed by the affected insurer 
in that event  we would also be required to apply a proportional amount  or substantially all in the case of insolvency of both insurers  of all rental payments by hertz to its special purpose leasing subsidiary and all car disposal proceeds under the applicable facility or series  or under substantially all us fleet debt facilities in the case of insolvency of both insurers  to pay down the amounts owed under the affected facility or series  instead of applying those proceeds to purchase additional cars and or for working capital purposes 
an insurer event of bankruptcy could lead to consequences that have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we were unable to negotiate mutually acceptable new terms with our us fleet debt lenders or if alternate funding were not available to us 
see item a risk factors risks relating to our substantial indebtedness the third party insurance companies that provide credit enhancements in the form of financial guarantees of us fleet debt could face financial instability due to factors beyond our control 
in connection with the acquisition and the issuance of  million of floating rate us fleet debt  hvf entered into certain interest rate swap agreements  or the hvf swaps  effective december   which qualify as cash flow hedging instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these agreements mature at various terms  in connection with the scheduled maturity of the associated debt obligations  through november under these agreements  hvf pays monthly interest at a fixed rate of per annum in exchange for monthly amounts at one month libor  effectively transforming the floating rate us fleet debt to fixed rate obligations 
hvf paid million to reduce the fixed interest rate on the hvf swaps from the prevailing market rates to 
ultimately  this amount will be recognized as additional interest expense over the remaining terms of the hvf swaps  which range from approximately to years 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded an expense of million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statement of operations  in interest  net of interest income  associated with the ineffectiveness of the hvf swaps 
the ineffectiveness resulted from a decline in the value of the hvf swaps due to a decrease in forward interest rates along with a decrease in the time value component as we continue to approach the maturity dates of the hvf swaps 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of the hvf swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as of december  and  the balance reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss was a loss of million net of tax of million and million net of tax of million  respectively 
as of december  and  the fair value of the hvf swaps was a liability of million and million  respectively  which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet in other accrued liabilities 
the fair value of the hvf swaps was calculated using a discounted cash flow method and applying observable market data ie the month libor yield curve and credit default swap spreads 
in connection with the entrance into the hvf swaps  hertz entered into seven differential interest rate swap agreements  or the differential swaps 
these differential swaps were required to be put in place to protect the counterparties to the hvf swaps in the event of an amortization event under the asset backed notes agreements 
in the event of an amortization event  the amount by which the principal balance on the floating rate portion of the us fleet debt is reduced  exclusive of the originally item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued scheduled amortization  becomes the notional amount of the differential swaps and is transferred to hertz 
there was no payment associated with these differential swaps and their notional amounts are and will continue to be zero unless there is an amortization event  which causes the amortization of the loan balance  or the debt is prepaid 
hvf is subject to numerous restrictive covenants under the abs indenture and the other agreements governing the us fleet debt  including restrictive covenants with respect to liens  indebtedness  benefit plans  mergers  disposition of assets  acquisition of assets  dividends  officers compensation  investments  agreements  the types of business it may conduct and other customary covenants for a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity

for the year ended december   net expenditures for revenue earning equipment and property and equipment increased slightly as compared to this increase was due to a year over year decrease in disposal proceeds relating to revenue earning equipment  partly offset by decreases in year over year expenditures for both revenue earning equipment and property and equipment 
off balance sheet commitments as of december  and december   the following guarantees including indemnification commitments were issued and outstanding indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the relevant industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction such as the sale of a business 
these indemnifications might include claims relating to the following environmental matters  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and employment related matters  customer  supplier and other commercial contractual relationships  and financial matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
we regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and have accrued for expected losses that are probable and estimable 
the types of indemnifications for which payments are possible include the following sponsors  directors on the closing date  hertz entered into customary indemnification agreements with us  the sponsors and our stockholders affiliated with the sponsors  pursuant to which hertz holdings and hertz will indemnify the sponsors  our stockholders affiliated with the sponsors and their respective affiliates  directors  officers  partners  members  employees  agents  representatives and controlling persons  against certain liabilities arising out of performance of a consulting agreement with hertz holdings and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued each of the sponsors and certain other claims and liabilities  including liabilities arising out of financing arrangements or securities offerings 
we also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock in november we do not believe that these indemnifications are reasonably likely to have a material impact on us 
environmental we have indemnified various parties for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage  recycling or disposal sites in many states and  in some instances  for natural resource damages 
the amount of any such expenses or related natural resource damages for which we may be held responsible could be substantial 
the probable expenses that we expect to incur for such matters have been accrued  and those expenses are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  the aggregate amounts accrued for environmental liabilities  including liability for environmental indemnities  reflected in our consolidated balance sheet in other accrued liabilities were million and million  respectively 
the accrual generally represents the estimated cost to study potential environmental issues at sites deemed to require investigation or clean up activities  and the estimated cost to implement remediation actions  including on going maintenance  as required 
cost estimates are developed by site 
initial cost estimates are based on historical experience at similar sites and are refined over time on the basis of in depth studies of the sites 
for many sites  the remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible cannot be reasonably estimated because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site  the materials there  the involvement of other potentially responsible parties  the application of laws and other standards or regulations  site conditions  and the nature and scope of investigations  studies  and remediation to be undertaken including the technologies to be required and the extent  duration  and success of remediation 
risk management for a discussion of additional risks arising from our operations  including vehicle liability  general liability and property damage insurable risks  see item business risk management 
market risks we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and historically have not been used for speculative or trading purposes 
in addition  derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on such instruments 
for more information on these exposures  see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
interest rate risk from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
in connection with the acquisition and the issuance of  million of floating rate us fleet debt  hvf entered into the hvf swaps effective december   which qualify as cash flow hedging instruments in accordance with sfas no 
these agreements mature at various terms  in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued connection with the scheduled maturity of the associated debt obligations  through november under these agreements  hvf pays monthly interest at a fixed rate of per annum in exchange for monthly amounts at one month libor  effectively transforming the floating rate us fleet debt to fixed rate obligations 
in connection with the entrance into the hvf swaps  hertz entered into seven differential swaps 
these differential swaps were required to be put in place to protect the counterparties to the hvf swaps in the event of an amortization event under the asset backed notes agreements 
in the event of an amortization event  the amount by which the principal balance on the floating rate portion of the us fleet debt is reduced  exclusive of the originally scheduled amortization  becomes the notional amount of the differential swaps  and is transferred to hertz 
an event of bankruptcy as defined in the indentures governing the us fleet debt with respect to mbia or ambac would constitute an amortization event under the portion of the us fleet debt facilities guaranteed by the affected insurer 
in that event we would also be required to apply a proportional amount  or substantially all in the case of insolvency of both insurers  of all rental payments by hertz to its special purpose leasing subsidiary and all car disposal proceeds under the applicable facility or series  or under substantially all us fleet debt facilities in the case of insolvency of both insurers  to pay down the amounts owed under the affected facility or series instead of applying those proceeds to purchase additional cars and or for working capital purposes 
an insurer event of bankruptcy could lead to consequences that have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we were unable to negotiate mutually acceptable new terms with our us fleet debt lenders or if alternate funding were not available to us 
in may  in connection with the forecasted issuance of the permanent take out international asset based facilities  hil purchased two swaptions for million  to protect itself from interest rate increases 
these swaptions gave hil the right  but not the obligation  to enter into three year interest rate swaps  based on a total notional amount of million at an interest rate of 
the swaptions were renewed twice in  prior to their scheduled expiration dates of march  and september   at a total cost of million and were due to expire on june  on june   these swaptions were sold for a realized gain of million or million 
additionally  on june   hil purchased two new swaptions for million  to protect itself from interest rate increases associated with the international abs fleet financing facility  which closed on july  these swaptions were based on an underlying transaction with a notional amount of million at an interest rate of 
on october   the outstanding swaptions were terminated and hertz received a million payment from counterparties 
on september   a supplement was signed to the indenture  dated as of august   between hvf and the bank of new york mellon trust company  na this supplement created the series notes for issuance by hvf 
in order to satisfy rating agency requirements related to its bankruptcy remote status  hvf acquired an interest rate cap in an amount equal to the series notes maximum principal amount of million with a strike rate of and a term until august  hvf bought the cap on the date the supplement was signed for million 
in connection with this interest rate cap  hertz sold an equal and opposite cap for million 
the fair value of these interest rate caps on december  were an asset of million and a liability of million 
the fair value of these interest rate caps was calculated using a discounted cash flow method and applying observable market data 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these interest rate caps are included in our results of operations in the periods incurred 
see notes and to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we have a significant amount of debt including under our us and international fleet debt facilities  other international fleet debt facilities  international abs fleet financing facility and senior abl facility with variable rates of interest based generally on libor  euribor or their equivalents for local currencies plus an applicable margin 
increases in interest rates could therefore significantly increase the associated interest payments that we are required to make on this debt 
we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings assuming various changes in market interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical increase of one percentage point in interest rates on our debt portfolio as of december   our net income would decrease by an estimated million over a twelve month period 
consistent with the terms of the agreements governing the respective debt obligations  we may hedge a portion of the floating rate interest exposure under the senior credit facilities  the us and international fleet debt and international abs fleet financing facility to provide protection in respect of such exposure 
foreign currency risk we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring  to the extent practicable  operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate  including making fleet and equipment purchases and borrowing for working capital needs 
also  we have purchased foreign exchange options to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for selected marketing programs 
the effect of exchange rate changes on these financial instruments would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our risks with respect to foreign exchange options are limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option and the future performance of the option s counterparty 
premiums paid for options outstanding as of december   were approximately million  and we limit counterparties to financial institutions that have strong credit ratings 
as of december  and december   the fair value of all outstanding foreign currency options was approximately million and million  respectively  which was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the fair value of the foreign currency options was calculated using a discounted cash flow method and applying observable market data 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these options are included in our results of operations 
we also manage exposure to fluctuations in currency risk on intercompany loans we make to certain of our subsidiaries by entering into foreign currency forward contracts at the time of the loans 
the forward rate is reflected in the intercompany loan rate to the subsidiaries  and as a result  the forward contracts have no material impact on our results of operations 
in connection with the transactions  we issued million of senior euro notes 
prior to october   our senior euro notes were not designated as a net investment hedge of our euro denominated net investments in our international operations 
on october   we designated our senior euro notes as an effective net investment hedge of our euro denominated net investment in our international operations 
as a result of this net investment hedge designation  as of december  and december   losses of million net of tax of million and million net of tax of million  respectively  attributable to the translation of our senior euro notes into the us dollar are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inflation the increased cost of vehicles is the primary inflationary factor affecting us 
many of our other operating expenses are also expected to increase with inflation  including health care costs and gasoline 
management does not expect that the effect of inflation on our overall operating costs will be greater for us than for our competitors 
like kind exchange program in january  we implemented a like kind exchange program for our us car rental business 
pursuant to the program  we dispose of vehicles and acquire replacement vehicles in a form intended to allow such dispositions and replacements to qualify as tax deferred like kind exchanges pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
the program has resulted in a material deferral of federal and state income taxes for fiscal and a like kind exchange program for herc has been in place for several years 
we cannot  however  offer assurance that the expected tax deferral will be achieved or that the relevant law concerning the programs will remain in its current form 
in addition  the benefit of deferral is subject to recapture  if  for example  there were a material downsizing of our fleet 
in september  bank of america announced it was acquiring merrill lynch co  inc  the parent company of mlgpe 
this transaction closed on january  accordingly  bank of america is now an indirect beneficial owner of our common stock held by mlgpe and certain of its affiliates 
for us income tax purposes the transaction  when combined with other unrelated transactions during the previous months  may have resulted in a change in control as that term is defined in section of the internal revenue code 
consequently  utilization of all pre us net operating losses may be subject to an annual limitation 
the limitation is not expected to result in a loss of net operating losses or have a material adverse impact on taxes 
employee retirement benefits pension we sponsor defined benefit pension plans worldwide 
pension obligations give rise to significant expenses that are dependent on assumptions discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
our worldwide pre tax pension expense was approximately million  which is a decrease of million from the decrease in expense compared to is primarily due to lower expense in the united kingdom of million and foreign exchange rate changes 
to the extent that there are layoffs affecting a significant number of employees covered by any pension plan worldwide  expense could vary significantly because of further charges or credits 
the funded status ie  the dollar amount by which the projected benefit obligations exceeded the market value of pension plan assets of our us qualified plan  in which most domestic employees participate  declined significantly as of december   compared with december  because asset values decreased due to a drop in the securities markets 
we review our pension assumptions regularly and from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required 
a discretionary contribution of million was made to our us qualified plan in the year ended december  no discretionary contributions were made to our us qualified plan in the years ended december  and for the years ended december  and  we contributed million and million  respectively  to our worldwide pension plans  including a discretionary contribution of million and million  respectively  to our uk defined benefit item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued pension plan  and benefit payments made through unfunded plans 
based upon the significant decline in asset values in  which were in line with the overall market declines  it is likely we will have to make cash contributions in and future years 
the actual level of contributions is uncertain and is dependent upon a final valuation of the plan liabilities  which will be completed later in the year 
in addition  under the pension protection act of  there are a number of choices in valuing assets and liabilities to determine the required level of funding that can produce a wide range of potential contributions 
the level of future contributions will vary  and is dependent on a number of factors including investment returns  interest rate fluctuations  plan demographics and funding regulations 
we participate in various multiemployer pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees 
we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants 
in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans  then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump sum contribution to the plan  and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan s funding of vested benefits 
in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans  we could decide to discontinue participation in a plan  and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability 
some multiemployer plans  including one in which we participate  are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities 
such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 
other postretirement benefits we provide limited postretirement health care and life insurance for employees of our domestic operations with hire dates prior to january  there are no plan assets associated with this plan 
we provide for these postretirement costs through monthly accruals 
the net periodic postretirement benefit gain for the year ended december  was million and the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  was million compared to a net periodic postretirement benefit cost of million for the year ended december  and an accumulated benefit obligation of million as of december  stock based compensation on february   our board of directors and that of hertz jointly approved the stock incentive plan 
the stock incentive plan provides for the sale of shares of stock of hertz holdings to our executive officers  other key employees and directors as well as the grant of stock options to purchase shares of hertz holdings to those individuals 
during the second quarter of  we made an equity offering to approximately of hertz s executives and key employees not including craig r 
koch  our former chief executive officer 
the shares sold and options granted to our employees in connection with this equity offering are subject to and governed by the terms of the stock incentive plan 
the offering closed on may  in connection with this offering  we sold  shares at a purchase price of per share and granted options to purchase an additional  shares at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for special cash dividends paid on june  and november  
in addition  on may   we granted hertz s key executives and employees except for mr 
koch options to acquire an additional  shares of our common stock at per share after adjustment for special cash dividends paid on june  and november    shares at per share after adjustment for special cash dividends paid on june  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued november  and  shares at per share after adjustment for special cash dividends paid on june  and november  
these options are subject to and governed by the stock incentive plan 
on june   mr 
koch purchased  shares of the common stock of hertz holdings at a purchase price of per share and received options to purchase an additional  shares at a purchase price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on june  
on august   the options issued to mr 
koch in june were cancelled and he was issued options to purchase  shares of common stock of hertz holdings at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on november  
hertz holdings made a payment to mr 
koch in connection with his share purchase equal to on august   certain newly hired employees purchased an aggregate of  shares at a purchase price of per share and were granted options to purchase  shares of hertz holdings stock at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on november  
also on august   in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement  mr 
frissora purchased  shares of the common stock of hertz holdings at a price of per share and was granted options to purchase  shares of common stock of hertz holdings at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on november    options at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on november  and  options at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on november  
all of mr 
frissora s options will vest per year on the first five anniversaries of the date of commencement of his employment and will have a ten year term 
during september  we determined that the fair value of our common stock as of august  was per share  rather than the that had originally been determined at that time and which we use for purposes of the stock incentive plan and federal income tax purposes 
consequently  we recognized compensation expense of approximately million  including amounts for a tax gross up on the initial discount to fair market value in accordance with mr 
frissora s employment agreement  in the quarter ended september  in order to assist management and the compensation committee of the board of directors in their determination of the value of the common stock of hertz holdings  hertz engaged an independent valuation specialist to perform a valuation of the common stock of hertz holdings at may  and june  the may th date is close to the initial stock purchase and option grant date of may  and the second option grant date of may  the june th date coincides with the payment of the special cash dividend of per share 
the independent valuation specialist weighted each of the income  market transaction and market comparable valuation approaches equally 
management and the compensation committee of the board of directors believe that the valuation approaches employed are appropriate for an enterprise such as hertz holdings  which has an established financial history of profitable operations and generation of positive cash flows 
the results of the approaches were not significantly different from one another 
in connection with the authorization of the special cash dividend of per share paid on june   the board of hertz holdings authorized the modification of the option exercise prices downward by an amount equal to the per share amount of the special cash dividend paid on june   thereby preserving the intrinsic value of the options  consistent with applicable tax law 
in order to assist item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management and the compensation committee of the board of directors in their determination of the value of the common stock of hertz holdings  an independent valuation was performed as of immediately before and after the modification 
we will recognize incremental compensation cost of approximately million related to the cost of modifying the exercise prices of the stock options for the special cash dividend over the remainder of the five year requisite vesting period that began on the grant date 
prior to the consummation of the initial public offering of the common stock of hertz holdings on november   hertz holdings declared a special cash dividend  to be paid promptly following the completion of the offering 
in connection with the special cash dividend  hertz holdings outstanding stock options were adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value of the options  consistent with applicable tax law and the terms of the stock incentive plan 
the board approved this modification on october  beginning on that date  the cost of the modification was recognized ratably over the remainder of the requisite service period for each grant 
because the modification was effective before the amount of the dividend was known  the cost of the modification reflected the assumption that the dividend would be funded by the proceeds to hertz holdings from the sale of the common stock after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
the assumed proceeds from the sale of the common stock were determined by assuming an offering price equivalent to the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of the initial public offering prospectus or per share and resulted in an estimated dividend of per share 
the actual dividend declared was per share 
we will recognize incremental compensation cost of million related to the cost of modifying the exercise prices of the stock options for the special cash dividend paid on november  over the remainder of the five year requisite service period 
this charge was based on the estimated dividend  rather than the actual dividend paid
