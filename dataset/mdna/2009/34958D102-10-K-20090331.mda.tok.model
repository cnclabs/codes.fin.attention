item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business formation and overview we were incorporated in delaware on december  as a special purpose acquisition company formed under the name fortress america acquisition corporation for the purpose of acquiring an operating business that performed services to the homeland security industry 
on july   we closed our initial public offering of  units  with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and two warrants each warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at per share 
the units were sold at an offering price of per unit  generating gross proceeds of  on august   we sold an additional  units pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option raising additional gross proceeds of  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses  the total net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately  of which  was deposited into a trust fund and the remaining proceeds of  were made available for business  legal and accounting due diligence on prospective business combinations and continuing general and administrative expenses 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of each of vtc  llc  doing business as total site solutions tss  and vortech  llc vortech and  together with tss  tss vortech and simultaneously changed our name to fortress international group  inc tss vortech provides comprehensive services for the planning  design  and development of mission critical facilities and information infrastructure 
after our initial acquisition of tss vortech  management continued an acquisition strategy to expand our geographical footprint  add complimentary services  and diversify and expand our customer base 
we acquired substantially all of the assets of comm site of south florida  inc on may   of the outstanding stock of innovative power systems  inc and quality power systems  inc 
on september   and of the membership interests of rubicon integration  llc on november  on january   we purchased of the outstanding stock of smlb  ltd 
as a result of these acquisitions  fiscal year was our first year to engage in operations  generating revenue and incurring debt and expenses 
we provide comprehensive services for the planning  design  and development of mission critical facilities and information infrastructure 
we also provide a single source solution for highly technical mission critical facilities such as data centers  operation centers  network facilities  server rooms  security operations centers  communications facilities and the infrastructure systems that are critical to their function 
our services include technology consulting  energy and green solutions consulting  engineering and design management  construction management  system installations  operations management  and facilities management and maintenance 
there are several legislative factors that we anticipate will drive demand for our services 
legislation such as sarbanes oxley compliance for publicly traded companies  hippa laws regarding protection and availability of data for healthcare organizations and the government s critical infrastructure protection program for industries that are vital to our economy have resulted in such companies having the need to invest to protect their networks  the reliability of those networks  and maintain their ability to perform transactions that are financial or informational in nature 
with respect to these critical infrastructure systems  we focus on physical security  network security  redundancies for uninterruptible power supply systems  electrical switch gear  stand by power generators  heat rejection and cooling systems  fire protection systems  monitoring and control systems  and security systems  as well as the physical environment that houses critical operations 
we help our customers plan for  prevent or mitigate against the consequences of attacks  power outages and natural disasters 
we provide our services  directly and indirectly  to both government customers and private sector customers 
a certain portion of our business relate to government entities mission critical facilities requiring the relocation  renovation and upgrade of facilities to protect information networks and data processing centers 
we have obtained a facility clearance from the united states department of defense 
this clearance enables the companies to access and service restricted government projects 
in addition to the facility clearance  tss has successfully cleared over one third of its employees  allowing them individual access to restricted projects and facilities 
several additional employees are currently in the process for clearance 
during the fiscal years and  we have expanded our sales reach by opening offices in new york  chicago and miami 
we plan to continue to expand geographically through internal growth initiatives  as well as through potential acquisitions of specialized mission critical engineering  it services firms primarily in the united states and mission critical facility management companies 
our customers include united states government and homeland defense agencies and private sector businesses that in some cases are the end user of the facility or in other cases are providing a facility to a government end user 
we categorize contracts where a government agency is the ultimate end user of the facility as government related contracts 
our revenues are derived from fees for our professional services as well as revenues earned under construction management contracts and facility management contracts with varying terms 
competition in current economic environment our industry may be adversely impacted by the current economic environment and tight credit conditions 
we have seen larger competitors seek to expand their offerings including a focus in mission critical market 
these larger competitors have a significant infrastructure to support and accordingly  we have begun to experience some price pressure as some are willing to take on projects at lower margins 
with certain customers  we have experienced a delay in spending  or deferral of projects to an indefinite commencement date due to the economic uncertainty or lack of access to capital 
this type of delay was demonstrated by our largest customer in the first quarter of  which led us to significantly reduce our backlog by million at december  although a formal cancellation of contracted amounts has not been received 
we believe there are high barriers to entry in our sector for new competitors due to our specialized technology service offerings which we deliver to our customers  our top secret clearances  and our turnkey suite of deliverables offered 
we compete for business based upon our reputation  past experience  and our technical engineering knowledge of mission critical facilities and their infrastructure 
we are developing and creating long term relationships with our customers because of our excellent reputation in the industry and will continue to create facility management relationships with our customers that we expect will provide us with steadier revenue streams to improve the value of our business 
finally  we seek to further expand our energy services that focus on operational cost savings that may be used to either fund the project or increase returns to the facility operator 
we believe these barriers and our technical capabilities and experience will differentiate us to compete with new entrants into the market or pricing pressures 
although we will closely monitor our proposal pricing and the volume of the work  we can not be certain that our current margins will be sustained 
furthermore  given the environment to the extent the volume of our contracts further decreases significantly  we may have to take additional measures to reduce our operating costs through reduced general  administrative and marketing costs  including potential reductions in personnel and related costs 
operations overview we contract with our customer under three primary contract types cost plus fee guaranteed maximum price  time and materials  and fixed price contracts 
cost plus fee guaranteed maximum price contracts are typically lower risk arrangements and thus yield lower profit margins than time and materials and fixed price arrangements which generate higher profit margins generally  relative to their higher risk 
where customer requirements are clear  we prefer to enter into time and materials and fixed price arrangements rather than cost plus fee contracts 
most of our revenue is generated based on services provided either by our employees or subcontractors 
to a lesser degree  the revenue we earn includes reimbursable travel and other costs to support the project 
thus  once we are awarded new business  the key to delivering the revenue is through hiring new employees to meet customer requirements  retaining our employees  and ensuring that we deploy them on direct billable jobs 
therefore  we closely monitor hiring success  attrition trends  and direct labor utilization 
since we earn higher profits from the labor services that our employees provide compared with subcontracted efforts and other reimbursable costs  we seek to optimize our labor content on the contracts we are awarded 
cost of revenue includes labor  or the salaries and wages of our employees  plus fringe benefits  the costs of subcontracted labor and outside consultants  equipment and materials  and other direct costs such as travel incurred to support contract efforts 
since we earn higher profits on our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services to revenue to decline when our labor services mix increases relative to subcontracted labor or third party material 
conversely  as subcontracted labor or third party material purchases for customers increase relative to our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services to revenue to increase 
as we continue to bid and win larger contracts  our own labor services component could decrease 
typically  the larger contracts are broader in scope and require more diverse capabilities  thus resulting in more subcontracted labor 
in addition  we can face hiring challenges in staffing larger contracts 
while these factors could lead to a higher ratio of cost of services to revenue  the economics of these larger jobs are nonetheless generally favorable because they increase income  broaden our revenue base and have a favorable return on invested capital 
depreciation and amortization expenses are affected by the level of our annual capital expenditures and the amount of identified intangible assets related to acquisitions 
we do not presently foresee significant changes in our capital expenditure requirements 
as we continue to make selected strategic acquisitions  the amortization of identified intangible assets may increase as a percentage of our revenue 
our operating income  or revenue minus cost of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization  and thus our operating margin  or the ratio of operating income to revenue  is driven by the mix and execution on our contracts  how we manage our costs  and the amortization charges resulting from acquisitions 
our cash position is driven primarily by the level of net income  working capital in accounts receivable  capital expenditures and acquisition activities 
contract backlog we believe an indicator of our future performance is our backlog of uncompleted projects in process or recently awarded 
our backlog represents our estimate of anticipated revenue from executed and awarded contracts that have not been completed and that we expect will be recognized as revenues over the life of the contracts 
we have broken our backlog into the following three categories i technology consulting consisting of services related to consulting and or engineering design contracts  ii construction management and iii facility management 
backlog is not a measure defined in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap  and our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology of other companies in determining their backlog 
our backlog is generally recognized under two categories contracts for which work authorizations have been or are expected to be received on a fixed price basis  guaranteed maximum price basis and time and materials basis  and contracts awarded to us where some  but not all  of the work have not yet been authorized 
as of december   our backlog was approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  in the first quarter  discussions with our single largest customer indicated that two projects were suspended as the customer deferred its expansion plans given the current economic environment and credit constraints 
although the contract is not cancelled  based on the customer indications we removed the two project totaling million from our december  backlog  which primarily accounts for the decrease in backlog from the prior year 
at december   we have authorizations to proceed with work for approximately million  or of our total backlog of million 
approximately million  or of our total backlog  related to three customers at december  at december   we had authorizations to proceed with work for approximately million or of our total backlog of million 
approximately  million  or of our backlog related to a single customer at december  we believe that approximately of the backlog at december  will be recognized over the next twelve months 
the following table reflects the value of our backlog in the above three categories as of december  and december   respectively in millions 
december  december  technology consulting construction management facilities management total related party transactions we have in the past  and continue to have transactions with related parties 
such transactions are reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors in accordance with our audit committee charter 
we believe that all of our related party transactions are completed at arm s length terms 
for a discussion of certain relationships and related party transactions  see note related party transactions of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below summarizes our related party transactions in millions successor predecessor for the period for the year ended december  january  to january  revenue cost of revenue selling  general and administrative critical accounting policies and significant estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  services have been rendered or goods delivered  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company s revenue is derived from the following types of contractual arrangements fixed price contracts  time and materials contracts and cost plus fee contracts including guaranteed maximum price contracts 
the company s primary source of revenue is from fixed price contracts and we apply statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  recognizing revenue on the percentage of completion method using costs incurred in relation to total estimated project costs 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
this method is used because management considers cost incurred and costs to complete to be the best available measure of progress in the contracts 
contract costs include all direct materials  subcontract and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  payroll taxes  employee benefits and supplies 
revenue on time and material contracts is recognized based on the actual labor hours performed at the contracted billable rates  and costs incurred on behalf of the customer 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of costs incurred  plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned 
fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts are recorded as earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation 
examples of estimates include the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under the contract  the costs of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of the company s progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of its standard management process  facts develop that require the company to revise its estimated total costs on revenue 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized  the company records the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which the revisions becomes known 
the full amount of an anticipated loss on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes probable and can reasonably be estimated 
under certain circumstances  the company may elect to work at risk prior to receiving an executed contract document 
the company has a formal procedure for authorizing any such at risk work to be incurred 
revenue  however  is deferred until a contract modification or vehicle is provided by the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on an analysis of our historical experience with bad debt write offs and an aging of the accounts receivable balance 
unanticipated changes in the financial condition of clients  or significant changes in the economy could impact the reserves required 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
as of december   accounts receivable of million is due from a customer to whom we have offered extended payment terms 
the customer had executed a promissory note in the same amount bearing interest at per annum with payments of interest only due monthly and the balance in full was due on december  during the fourth quarter  the customer paid million and we extended the million note balance for an additional six months to june  this amount was recognized as revenue during the year ended december  we have a history of conducting business with this customer and therefore believe collectability is reasonably assured 
non cash compensation we apply the expense recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 therefore  the recognition of the value of the instruments results in compensation or professional expenses in our financial statements 
the expense differs from other compensation and professional expenses in that these charges are typically settled through the issuance of common stock  which would have a dilutive effect upon earnings per share  if and when such warrants are exercised or restricted stock vests 
the determination of the estimated fair value used to record the compensation or professional expenses associated with the equity or liability instruments issued requires management to make a number of assumptions and estimates that can change or fluctuate over time 
goodwill and other purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired 
other purchased intangible assets include the fair value of items such as customer contracts  backlog and customer relationships 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 establishes financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but rather tested for impairment on an annual basis or triggering event 
purchased intangible assets with a definite useful life are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated fair market value of identified intangible assets is amortized over the estimated useful life of the related intangible asset 
we have a process pursuant to which we typically retain third party valuation experts to assist us in determining the fair market values and useful lives of identified intangible assets 
we evaluate these assets for impairment when events occur that suggest a possible impairment 
such events could include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant client or contract  decreases in federal government appropriations or funding for specific programs or contracts  or other similar events 
we determine impairment by comparing the net book value of the asset to its future undiscounted net cash flows 
if impairment occurs  we will record an impairment expense equal to the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated discounted cash flows using a discount rate based on our cost of capital and the related risks of recoverability 
in  we experienced several events potentially indicating impairment including a reduction in forecasted revenues and a decline in our market price eventually determined to be other than temporary 
accordingly   we conducted such analyses that resulted in impairment loss on goodwill of million 
at december   the residual carrying value of goodwill is million 
additionally  in an effort to rationalize our marketing effort and consolidate our product offerings under a single brand name fortress international group  inc  we abandoned acquired trade names resulting in impairment loss of approximately million during the year ended december  long lived assets excluding goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
in accounting for long lived assets such as property  equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  we review the assets for impairment 
if circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable  a loss is recognized at the time impairment exists and a permanent reduction in the carrying value of the asset is recorded 
we believe that the carrying values of its long lived assets as of december  are fully realizable 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also must analyze income tax reserves  as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income  as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
effective january   we were required to adopt fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin prescribes a more likely than not threshold of financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures 
since inception and through january   the adoption date of this standard  we were in essence a blank check company with no substantive operations 
management has concluded that the adoption of fin had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
as of december   we do not have any material gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market of that asset is not active fsp 
fsp provides an example that clarifies and reiterates certain provisions of the existing fair value standard  including basing fair value on orderly transactions and usage of management and broker inputs 
fsp is effective immediately but is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles the gaap hierarchy 
sfas no 
will become effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in april  fasb issued a staff position fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  fsp which amends the factors a company should consider when developing renewal assumptions used to determine the useful life of an intangible asset under sfas fsp replaces the previous useful life criteria with a new requirement that an entity consider its own historical experience in renewing similar arrangements 
in issuing fsp  the fasb hopes to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
fas is effective as of january  we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of fas may have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas no 
r which replaces sfas no 
the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
sfas no 
r is effective beginning january  and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily driven by a million increase in our construction management services and million increase attribute to the inclusion of a full year results from the acquisitions of innovative  rubicon  and smlb 
the increase in construction management services is primarily attributable to our increased sales and marketing efforts in late through to diversify and grow our customer base 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was driven by the increase in revenue primarily from our construction management services and million increase of expenses attribute to the inclusion of a full year results from the acquisitions of innovative  rubicon  and smlb 
gross margin percentage 
gross margin percentage decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  of the total decrease in gross profit  was due to an estimated loss on a contract we acquired with smlb  and the remaining decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in the proportion of construction management revenues as proportion of total revenue  which typically have a lower profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily driven by million of selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the acquisitions of innovative  rubicon and smlb  and million that we expensed associated with abandoned acquisitions 
as we have experienced delays in the timing of revenues associated with certain customers and lower margins  we began implementing a plan to restructure expenses to align with current operating revenues 
the plan seeks to reduce operating costs associated with personnel and related costs  professional fees  and sales and marketing  which resulted in lower total selling  general and administrative costs during the fourth quarter of to the extent our business experiences continued delays or reduced margins  we may further reduce operating costs associated with personnel and related costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to there being a full year of amortization of the intangible assets from our acquisitions of innovative  rubicon and smlb 
impairment loss on intangibles 
throughout  we continued to incur operating losses  revised our forecasted revenues as certain of our acquisitions have not delivered originally anticipated revenues and experienced other than temporary market decline in our equity value 
based on these potential impairment indicators  we conducted analyses of the operations in order to identify any impairment in the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles related to our business 
analyzing our business based on company specific value approach  an income approach  and a market approach  we determined that the carrying value exceeded the current fair value of our business  resulting in goodwill impairment of million for the year ended december  at december   the adjusted carrying value of goodwill was million 
in the fourth quarter of  we elected to abandon certain acquired trade names in a plan to market under a single name  fortress international group  inc we intend to brand our products under this trade name to simplify our marketing strategy  mitigate potential confusion with customers  and potentially further reduce marketing costs 
as a result of the trade name abandonment  we recorded a loss of million in the fourth quarter at december   the carrying value of our remaining trade name was million 
interest income expense  net 
our interest income expense  net  decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was due primarily to a lower average invested balance in the year ended december   compared to year ended december  income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense benefit decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   income tax benefit was million reflecting the value of a nol carryback to prior periods at an effective federal rate of  net of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources overview successor predecessor for the period for the year ended december  janaury  to january  cash provided by used in operations cash provided by used in investing cash provided by used in financing net increase decrease in cash from inception through january   we operated solely as an investment vehicle to acquire an operating company consistent with our purpose 
we completed our initial public offering on july   resulting in funds of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
we invested the net proceeds from our initial public offering ipo in short term us treasury bills and used the earned interest to fund our operating costs associated with our pursuit of acquisition candidates 
investing activity from inception through january  was limited to investing our ipo proceeds in a trust account 
aside from the ipo  no significant financing activity occurred through january  on january   we acquired tss vortech and transitioned from being a special purpose acquisition company to an operating company 
successor for the year ended december  change net loss adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by used in operations impairment loss on goodwill and other intangibles amortization of intangibles stock and warrant based compensation other non cash items net adjustments to reconcile net income for non cash items net change in working capital cash provided by used in operations cash provided by used in investing cash used in financing net increase decrease in cash for the year ended december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million respectively 
operating activity net cash provided by operations increased million to million for the year ended december  from million used in operations for the year ended december  the increase in operating cash flow is primarily attributable to the following increase in net loss 
we had a million increase in our net loss due to million of increased non cash items consisting primarily of amortization  impairment loss on goodwill and other intangibles and stock based compensation 
excluding non cash items  our net loss decreased million from the preceding year 
this improvement in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to the increased volume in the construction management revenue and the addition of innovative and rubicon  while maintaining a relatively fixed cost infrastructure for most of the year 
the information above is not intended to replace or represent the entire cash flow statement of the company  which is available in our financials statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
decrease in working capital 
net changes in operating assets and liabilities increased approximately million accounting for the remaining increase in operating cash flows 
the increase was attributable primarily to million associated with unusual timing on contracts 
we received more cash receipts close to year end not allowing the corresponding payments to vendors to be made 
management generally seeks to balance customer and vendor cash flows via contractual terms standard to our industry 
investing activity net cash used in investing increased million to million for the year ended december  from million provided by investing activities for the year ended december  excluding the cash in flow related to the unusual event of converting to an operating company during  cash used in investing decreased million from the prior year primarily due to lower acquisition activity in the year ended december  acquisitions 
cash used for acquisitions decreased million as we acquired a single company with a net cash investment of million in the year ended december   compared to the acquisition of four companies with a net cash investment of million in the year ended december   resulting in a net cash investment of approximately million 
we abandoned acquisition efforts in due to the contraction in the economy and credit markets 
sale of investments held in trust 
upon the approval of the tss vortech acquisition in  we sold approximately million in trust investments to fund the cash portion the acquisition of tss vortech and related operations  and repay dissenting shareholders electing to receive their ipo proceeds back 
financing activity net cash used in financing decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million used in financing activities for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in financing activities was attributable fundamentally to different activity as described in the following repayment of seller notes 
debt services was approximately million in both and during the year ended december   we repaid million of unsecured promissory notes that were issued to the rubicon sellers upon achievement of certain financial targets at december  and june  repurchase of common stock 
during the first quarter of  we used million to repurchase our common stock associated with the election of conversion rights by our dissenting shareholders in connection with our acquisition of tss vortech and a share buyback program 
the share buyback program was suspended in the third quarter of  however  during  we repurchased  shares at an average price of per share for employee taxes associated with net issuance of vesting restricted stock 
non cash activities during the year ended december   we issued total unsecured promissory notes totaling million as purchase consideration 
in connection with the acquisitions of smlb  we initially issued million of unsecured promissory notes that were reduced in the second quarter of to  pursuant to the working capital adjustments pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement 
consistent with the rubicon purchase agreement in exchange for achieving specified financial targets through december   we issued rubicon sellers additional consideration totaling million of which million of unsecured promissory notes were issued and an additional million was in accrued payables 
finally  per the terms of the innovative purchase agreement  in exchange for achieving specified financial targets through december   we owed innovative sellers an additional million  which was included in accrued payables at december  during the third quarter  our chief executive officer and chief operating officer  both of the selling members of tss vortech  entered into an agreement with the company to convert  and  respectively  of their respective notes into common stock at a conversion price of per share  resulting in the aggregate issuance of  common shares 
the conversion has been recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
in addition  the chief operating officer agreed to postpone any principal and interest payments payable to him under his remaining  promissory note until march   with such interest to be accrued to the outstanding principal 
at december    of the chief operating officer s note remains outstanding  which is convertible at per shares to  shares of the company s common stock 
for a discussion of our acquisitions  see note acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the third quarter of  we initiated a plan to restructure expenses to realign them with the current operating revenues and gross margins as certain customers have delayed their spending 
our plan seeks to reduce operating costs associated with professional fees  sales and marketing  and personnel and related costs 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and expected future cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working capital  capital expenditure and investment requirements through the next twelve months 
we may elect to secure additional capital in the future  at acceptable terms  to improve our liquidity or fund acquisitions 
the amounts involved in any such transaction  individually or in the aggregate  may be material 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of acquisition plan  which could impact our business  financial condition and earnings 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements
