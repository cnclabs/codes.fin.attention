item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are continuing our efforts to broaden our customer base through the development of new products and new applications of our existing products for use by ophthalmologists and dermatologists 
we currently estimate that there are approximately  ophthalmologists in the united states and  internationally who are potential customers 
additionally  we estimate that there are approximately  and  hospitals in the united states and internationally  respectively  as well as approximately  ambulatory surgical centers in the united states which potentially represent multiple unit sales 
we believe there are approximately  dermatologists and approximately  plastic surgeons in the united states who are potential customers 
because independent ophthalmologists and dermatologists frequently practice at their own offices  as well as through affiliations with hospitals or other medical centers  each independent ophthalmologist  dermatologist  plastic surgeon  office  hospital and medical center is a potential customer for our products 
we seek to provide superior customer support and service and believe that our customer service and technical support distinguish our product offerings from those of our competitors 
we provide depot service at our mountain view facility for our ophthalmology and small aesthetics products and we provide field service for the large aesthetics products we acquired in the laserscope acquisition 
our customer support representatives assist customers with orders  warranty returns and other administrative functions 
our technical support engineers provide customers with answers to technical and product related questions 
we maintain an around the clock telephone service line to service our customers 
if a problem with a depot serviceable product cannot be diagnosed and resolved by telephone  a service loaner is shipped overnight to domestic customers under warranty or service contract  and by the most rapid delivery means available to our international customers  and the problem unit is returned to us 
the small size and rugged design of our products allows for economical shipment and quick response to customers almost anywhere in the world 
sales and marketing we sell and market our products in the united states predominantly through our direct sales force 
our direct sales force is separated into two separate divisions  one for ophthalmology and one for aesthetics 
in total we had a direct sales force of employees who were engaged in sales efforts within the united states as of january  our sales and marketing organization is based at our corporate headquarters in mountain view  california with area sales managers located throughout the united states 
we sell and market our products internationally through approximately independent distributors into over countries 
international sales represented  and of our sales in  and  respectively 
we believe that our international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our 
table of contents revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result of the laserscope acquisition we acquired two wholly owned subsidiaries  one located in the uk and the other in france 
our subsidiaries are responsible for selling  marketing and servicing our aesthetics products in their local geography 
in june  we transitioned the responsibility for the sales and service of our aesthetics products in the uk to an independent distributor 
our other international sales are made principally to customers in europe  asia  the pacific rim  the middle east and latin america 
our indirect international sales are administered through our corporate headquarters in mountain view  california 
our distribution agreements with our international distributors are generally exclusive and typically can be terminated by either party without cause with days notice 
international sales may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls  currency fluctuations  restrictions on export technology  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and the economic condition in each country in which we sell our products 
see item a 
risk factors factors that may affect future results we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results 
to support our sales process we conduct marketing programs which include clinical education  direct mail  trade shows  public relations  market research  and advertising in trade and academic journals and newsletters 
we annually participate in over trade shows worldwide 
these meetings allow us to present our products to existing and prospective buyers 
through marketing  we collaborate with our customers to enhance our ability to identify new applications for our products  validate new procedures using our products and identify new product applications which help meet their unmet needs 
customers include key opinion leaders who are often the heads of the departments in which they work or professors at universities 
we believe that these luminaries in the field of ophthalmology and dermatology are key to the successful introduction of new products and the subsequent acceptance of these new products by the general market 
acceptance of our products by these early adopters is key to our strategy in the validation and commercialization of our new products 
operations the manufacture of our infrared and visible light photocoagulators and the related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process 
completed systems must pass quality control and reliability tests before shipment 
our manufacturing activities consist of specifying  sourcing  assembling and testing of components and certain subassemblies for assembly into our final product 
as of january   we had a total of employees engaged in manufacturing activities 
the medical devices manufactured by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  including federal  state  and foreign governmental agencies 
the principal regulator in the united states is the food and drug administration fda 
in april  we received certification for iso en  which is an international quality system standard that documents compliance to the european medical device directive 
in february  we were certified to iso  which replaced iso en as the international standard for quality systems as applied to medical devices 
in august  we received fda k clearance on our family of iridex iq laser systems 
this clearance covers the iridex iq  iq  iq  and iq laser systems and their associated delivery devices to deliver laser energy in either cw pulse  micropulse or longpulse mode 
these laser systems are intended for a wide range of specific applications in the medical specialties of ophthalmology  ear  nose and throat ent otolaryngology and dermatology 
we rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products  although we assemble critical subassemblies and the final product at our facility in mountain view  california 
some of these suppliers and manufacturers are sole source 
we have some long term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers but currently purchase most components on a purchase order basis 
these components may not be available in the quantities required  on reasonable terms  or at all 
financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability 
any 
table of contents failures by such third parties to adequately perform may delay the submission of products for regulatory approval  impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis or otherwise impair our competitive position 
see item a 
risk factors factors that may affect future results we depend on sole source or limited source suppliers 
international regulatory bodies often establish varying product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
as a result of our sales in europe  we are required to have all products ce marked  an international symbol affixed to all products demonstrating compliance to the european medical device directive and all applicable standards 
in july  we received ce mark certification under annex ii guidelines  the most stringent path to ce certification 
with annex ii ce mark certification  we have demonstrated our ability to both understand and comply with all applicable standards under the european medical device directive 
this allows us to ce mark any product upon our internal verification of compliance to all applicable european standards 
currently  all released products are ce marked 
continued certification is based on successful review of the process by our european registrar during its annual audit 
any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see item a 
risk factors factors that may affect future results we are subject to government regulations which may cause us to delay or withdraw the introduction of new products or new applications for our products 
competition competition in the market for laser systems and delivery devices used for ophthalmic and aesthetics treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase 
this market is also characterized by rapid technological innovation and change 
we compete by providing features and services that are valued by our customers such as product performance  clinical outcomes  ease of use  durability  versatility  customer training services and rapid repair of equipment 
our principal competitors in ophthalmology are alcon inc  carl zeiss meditec ag  nidek co 
ltd  synergetics  ellex medical lasers  ltd 
and lumenis ltd 
most of these companies currently offer a competitive  semiconductor based laser system for ophthalmology 
also within ophthalmology  pharmaceutical alternative treatments for amd such as lucentis avastin genentech  and to a lesser extent visudyne novartis and macugen osi pharmaceuticals compete rigorously with traditional laser procedures 
in aesthetics our principal competitors are cutera  candela corporation  palomar technologies  inc  sciton  lumenis ltd and cynosure 
some ophthalmic and aesthetic competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  product development  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
some companies also have greater name recognition than us and long standing customer relationships 
in addition  other medical companies  academic and research institutions  or others  may develop new technologies or therapies  including medical devices  surgical procedures or pharmacological treatments and obtain regulatory approval for products utilizing such techniques that are more effective in treating the conditions targeted by us  or are less expensive than our current or future products 
our technologies and products could be rendered obsolete by such developments 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item a 
risk factors factors that may affect future results we face strong competition in our markets and expect the level of competition to grow in the foreseeable future 
patents and proprietary rights our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we file patent applications to 
table of contents protect technology  inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business 
we have been issued sixteen united states patents and five foreign patents on the technologies related to our products and processes  which have expiration dates ranging from to we have approximately six pending patent applications in the united states and six foreign pending patent applications that have been filed 
our patent applications may not be approved 
along with the acquisition of the ams laserscope aesthetic products  we acquired a royalty free license to eleven of the ams laserscope patents 
in addition  we acquired a license to a palomar patent under which royalties are paid to palomar based upon a percentage of sales of certain products acquired from ams laserscope 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect  in part  through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us  without additional consideration  any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions see item a 
risk factors factors that may affect future results we rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our intellectual property and business 
government regulation the medical devices to be marketed and manufactured by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  including federal  state  and foreign governmental agencies 
pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder the fda act  the fda serves as the principal federal agency within the united states with authority over medical devices and regulates the research  clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution  sale  marketing and promotion of such devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizures of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us 
in the united states  medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i  ii or iii 
the class to which the device is assigned determines  among other things  the type of premarketing submission application required for fda clearance to market 
if the device is classified as class i or ii  and if it is not exempt  a k premarket notification will be required for marketing under fda regulations  class i devices are subject to general controls for example  labeling  premarket notification and adherence to quality system regulations qsrs requirements 
class ii devices receive marketing clearance through a k premarket notification 
for class iii devices  a premarket approval pma application will be required unless your device is a pre amendments device on the market prior to the passage of the medical device amendments in  or substantially equivalent to such a device and pmas have not been called for 
in that case  a k will be the route to market 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or ii medical device  or to a class iii medical device for which the fda has not called for a pma 
the fda may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  or that additional information or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
a request for additional data may require that clinical studies of the device s safety and efficacy be performed 
commercial distribution of a device for which a k notification is required can begin only after the fda issues an order finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device 
the fda has recently been requiring a more rigorous demonstration of substantial equivalence than in the past 
even in cases where the fda grants a k clearance  it can take the fda from three to six months from the date of submission to grant a k clearance  but it may take longer 

table of contents a not substantially equivalent determination  or a request for additional information  could delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category and could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for any of our products that are cleared through the k process  such as our iq system  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new k submissions 
we have obtained k clearance for all of our marketed products 
we have also modified aspects of our products since receiving regulatory clearance  but we believe that new k clearances are not required for these modifications 
after a device receives k clearance or a pma  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  will require a new clearance or approval 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially  but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination 
if the fda disagrees with our determination not to seek a new k clearance or pma  the fda may retroactively require us to seek k clearance or premarket approval 
the fda could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and or recall the modified device until k clearance or pma approval is obtained 
also  in these circumstances  we may be subject to significant regulating fines or penalties 
any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda clearances or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device 
device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and certain state agencies 
the fda act requires devices to be manufactured to comply with applicable qsr regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to design  development  manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda and the food and drug branch of the california department of health services  or cdhs  to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations  and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors 
labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses 
we and our products are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed 
any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities 
manufacturers are also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future 
such laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business 
exports of our products are regulated by the fda and are covered by the export amendment of  which greatly expanded the export of approved and unapproved united states medical devices 
however  some foreign countries require manufacturers to provide an fda certificate for products for export cpe which requires the device manufacturer to certify to the fda that the product has been granted premarket clearance in the united states and that the manufacturing facilities appeared to be in compliance with qsr at the time of the last qsr inspection 
the fda will refuse to issue a cpe if significant outstanding qsr violations exist 
we are also regulated under the radiation control for health and safety act  which requires laser products to comply with performance standards  including design and operation requirements  and manufacturers to certify in product labeling and in reports to the fda that their products comply with all such standards 
the law also requires laser manufacturers to file new product and annual reports  maintain manufacturing  testing and sales records and report product defects 
various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed  depending on the class of the product 

table of contents the introduction of our products in foreign markets will also subject us to foreign regulatory clearances which may impose substantial additional costs and burdens 
international sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country 
many countries also impose product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices 
in addition  each country has its own tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the approval by the fda and foreign government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain 
the necessary approvals or clearances may not be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays in receipt of  or a failure to receive  such approvals or clearances  or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements or policies by the fda or other foreign and domestic regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future 
these laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
reimbursement the cost of a significant portion of medical care in the united states is funded by government programs  health maintenance organizations and private insurance plans 
our ophthalmology products are typically purchased by doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users  which bill various third party payers  such as government programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to their patients 
government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals and other health care providers have significantly impacted the spending budgets of doctors  clinics and hospitals to acquire new equipment  including our products 
under certain government insurance programs  a health care provider is reimbursed for a fixed sum for services rendered in treating a patient  regardless of the actual charge for such treatment 
the center for medicare and medicaid services cms reimburses hospitals on a prospectively determined fixed amount for the costs associated with an in patient hospitalization based on the patient s discharge diagnosis 
cms reimburses physicians a prospectively determined fixed amount based on the procedure performed  regardless of the actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care and regardless of the specific devices used in that procedure 
reimbursement issues have affected sales of our ophthalmic products to a greater extent than sales of our aesthetics products because aesthetics procedures  in general  are not covered under most insurance programs and the cost of these procedures are paid for by the patient 
private third party reimbursement plans are also developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs by imposing limitations on reimbursable procedures and the exploration of more cost effective methods of delivering health care 
in general  these government and private measures have caused health care providers  including our customers  to be more selective in the purchase of medical products 
in addition  changes in government regulation or in private third party payers policies may limit or eliminate reimbursement for procedures employing our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see item a risk factors factors that may affect future results our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in third party coverage and reimbursement policies and any uncertainty regarding healthcare reform measures 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third party payers 
while we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed  payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used  was investigational or was not cost effective 

table of contents backlog we generally do not maintain a high level of backlog 
as a result  we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is indicative of future sales levels 
employees at january  we had a total of full time employees in the us and in france  including in operations and service  in sales and marketing  in research and development and in finance and administration 
we also employ  from time to time  a number of temporary and part time employees as well as consultants on a contract basis 
at january   we employed such persons 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly qualified employees  who are in great demand 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization  and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike 
we consider our employee relations to be good

table of contents item a 
risk factors factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information contained in this annual report form k  we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  common stock price  financial condition or results of operation 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
we are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic slowdowns and related uncertainties 
we are subject to macro economic fluctuations in the us economy 
concerns about consumer and investor confidence  volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending  international conflicts  terrorist and military activity  civil unrest and pandemic illness could cause a slowdown in customer orders or cause customer order cancellations 
in addition  political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
recent macro economic issues involving the broader financial markets  including the housing and credit system and general liquidity issues in the securities markets  have negatively impacted the economy and may negatively affect our growth 
in addition  weak economic conditions and declines in consumer spending and consumption may harm our operating results 
purchases of our products are often discretionary 
if the economic climate deteriorates further  customers or potential customers could delay  reduce or forego their purchases of our products and services  which could impact our business in a number of ways  including lower prices for our products and services and reduced or delayed sales 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the current financial crisis on our business  including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  delays in customer payments of outstanding accounts receivable and or customer insolvencies  counterparty failures negatively impacting our operations  and increased expense or inability to obtain future financing 
if the negative macro economic conditions persist  or if the economy enters a prolonged period of decelerating growth  our results of operations may be harmed 
we rely on continued market acceptance of our existing products and any decline in sales of our existing products would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we currently market visible and infrared medical laser systems and delivery devices to the ophthalmology and aesthetics markets 
we believe that continued and increased sales  if any  of these medical laser systems is dependent upon a number of factors including the following acceptance of product performance  features  ease of use  scalability and durability  recommendations and opinions by ophthalmologists  dermatologists  plastic surgeons  other clinicians  and their associated opinion leaders  clinical study outcomes  price of our products and prices of competing products and technologies particularly in light of the current macro economic environment  in which the availability of credit is limited and purchasers may delay capital investments or place additional emphasis on price when making their purchase decision  availability of competing products  technologies and alternative treatments  and level of reimbursement for treatments administered with our products 
in addition  we derive a meaningful portion of our sales from recurring revenues including consumable endoprobe devices and service 
our ability to increase recurring revenues from the sale of consumable endoprobe devices will depend primarily upon the features of our current products and product innovation  ease 
table of contents of use and prices of our products  including the relationship to prices of competing delivery devices 
the level of our service revenues will depend on the quality of service we provide and the responsiveness and the willingness of our customers to request our services rather than purchase competing products or services 
any significant decline in market acceptance of our products or our revenues derived from the sales of laser consoles  delivery devices or services may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if there is not sufficient demand for the aesthetics procedures performed with our products  practitioner demand for our products could be inhibited  resulting in unfavorable operating results and reduced growth potential 
the global aesthetics market has seen a sharp contraction in and we have seen reduced demand for our products because most procedures performed using our aesthetics products are elective procedures not reimbursable through government or private health insurance  with the costs borne by the patient 
the decision to purchase our aesthetics products may therefore be influenced by a number of factors  including consumer confidence  which may be impacted by economic and political conditions  the success of our sales and marketing efforts  evolving customer needs  the introduction of new products and technologies  evolving surgical practices  evolving industry standards  the cost of procedures performed using our products  and the cost  safety and effectiveness of alternative treatments  including treatments which are not based upon laser or other light based technologies and treatments which use pharmaceutical products 
if  as a result of these factors  there is not sufficient demand for the procedures performed with our aesthetics products  practitioner demand for our aesthetics products could be reduced  resulting in unfavorable operating results and lower growth potential 
we have more indebtedness and fewer liquid resources after the acquisition of the aesthetics business of ams and laserscope  which adversely affects our cash flows and business 
in order to complete the laserscope acquisition  we entered into financing arrangements and used the majority of our liquid resources 
prior to the acquisition  we had no debt outstanding but now we have million outstanding against our current line of credit 
the increased levels of debt and obligations do among other things make it more difficult for us to meet our payments and other obligations to other third parties  increase our vulnerability to  and limit our flexibility in planning for  adverse economic and industry conditions  increase our sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates  result in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements  which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable  affect our credit rating  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  additional acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  
table of contents create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with less indebtedness  and limit our ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the repayment of debt 
we believe there may be a risk as to whether our current liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to meet our planned operating requirements for the next months 
the company s credit facility with wells fargo bank is an asset based revolving line of credit 
the amount of money the company may borrow at any particular time is determined by the amount of eligible accounts receivables and inventory the company has on hand at that particular time the borrowing base 
if at any time the amount outstanding under the credit line exceeds the borrowing base the company will be required to pay the difference between the outstanding amount and the borrowing base immediately 
with the current crisis in the global economy it is possible that customers will take longer to pay and or default on their payments 
under such circumstances the borrowing base may be reduced significantly  which will reduce the company s ability to borrow and will have a direct negative impact on the company s cash position 
management is of the opinion that the company s current cash and cash equivalents together with its credit facility provides sufficient liquidity to operate for the next months  that the covenants contained in the company s credit facility with wells fargo bank are reasonable and management expects to be able to meet these covenants 
however if the company is not able to perform as projected in its operating plan and becomes out of compliance with its debt covenants  wells fargo bank would be entitled to exercise its remedies under the credit facility which include declaring all outstanding obligations thereunder due 
for example  in august the company was not in compliance with the debt service covenant contained in the credit facility with wells fargo bank  however  the company has obtained a waiver from the bank and was in compliance with the covenants in september and at january  we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a large portion of our revenues from international sales 
for the fiscal year ended january   our international sales were million or of total sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues  particularly ophthalmology  in the foreseeable future 
none of our international revenues and costs has been denominated in foreign currencies  other than sales made by our french subsidiary 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies makes our products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets 
the factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations and sales are subject to a number of other risks and potential costs  including impact of recessions in global economies and availability of credit  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  performance of our international channel of distributors  longer accounts receivable collection periods  differing local product preferences and product requirements  cultural differences  changes in foreign medical reimbursement and coverage policies and programs  political and economic instability  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  foreign certification requirements  including continued ability to use the ce mark in europe  
table of contents reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states  potentially adverse tax consequences  and multiple protectionist  adverse and changing foreign governmental laws and regulations 
any one or more of these factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as we expand our existing international operations we may encounter new risks 
for example  as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions  we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies 
if we are not successful in developing these relationships  we may not be able to grow sales in these geographic regions 
these or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
we face strong competition in our markets and expect the level of competition to grow in the foreseeable future 
competition in the market for devices used for ophthalmic and aesthetics treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase 
our competitive position depends on a number of factors including product performance  characteristics and functionality  ease of use  scalability  durability and cost 
our principal competitors in ophthalmology are alcon inc  carl zeiss meditec ag  nidek co 
ltd  synergetics  ellex medical lasers  ltd 
and lumenis ltd 
most of these companies currently offer a competitive  semiconductor based laser system for ophthalmology 
also within ophthalmology  pharmaceutical alternative treatments for amd such as lucentis avastin genentech  and to a lesser extent visudyne novartis and macugen osi pharmaceuticals compete rigorously with traditional laser procedures 
in aesthetics our principal competitors are cutera  candela corporation  palomar technologies  inc  sciton  lumenis ltd 
and cynosure 
these competitors have more sales representatives supporting broader product lines 
some competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  product development  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
in both markets  some companies also have greater name recognition than we do and long standing customer relationships 
in addition to other companies that manufacture photocoagulators  we compete with pharmaceuticals  other technologies and other surgical techniques 
some medical companies  academic and research institutions  or others  may develop new technologies or therapies that are more effective in treating conditions targeted by us or are less expensive than our current or future products 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and new applications 
our future success is dependent upon  among other factors  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval or clearance of  manufacture and market new products 
successful commercialization of new products and new applications will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and effectively coordinate with our suppliers 
in addition  we must successfully sell and achieve market acceptance of new products and applications and enhanced versions of existing products 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables  which include  among other things  price  safety  efficacy  reliability  marketing and sales efforts  the development of new applications for these products  the availability of third party reimbursement of procedures using our new products  the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation  including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and foreign government agencies 
any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or 
table of contents enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and would cause our net revenues to decline 
while we devote significant resources to research and development  our research and development may not lead to new products that achieve commercial success 
the company s ability to generate incremental revenue growth will depend  in part  on the successful outcome of research and development activities  including clinical trials that lead to the development of new products and new applications using our products 
our research and development process is expensive  prolonged  and entails considerable uncertainty 
because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic and aesthetics research and development  products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required to market such products successfully 
the products currently in our development pipeline may not be approved by regulatory entities and may not be commercially successful  and our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products of current or future competitors 
therefore  even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products  these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 
the clinical trial process required to obtain regulatory approvals is costly and uncertain  and could result in delays in new product introductions or even an inability to release a product 
the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals for our products are complex and expensive and their outcomes are uncertain 
we incur substantial expense for  and devote significant time to  clinical trials but cannot be certain that the trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product 
we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after earlier clinical trials showed promising results 
any of our products may produce undesirable side effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate 
we  the fda  or another regulatory authority may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if they or we believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 
if we cannot increase our sales volumes  reduce our costs or introduce higher margin products to offset anticipated reductions in the average unit price of our products  our operating results may suffer 
the average unit price of our products may decrease in the future in response to changes in product mix  competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by our competitors or other factors 
if we are unable to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or through new product introductions  our net revenues will decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
if we cannot maintain our gross margins our business could be seriously harmed  particularly if the average selling price of our products decreases significantly without a corresponding increase in sales 
we rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our intellectual property and business 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business 
we have been issued sixteen united states patents and five foreign patents on the technologies related to our products and processes 
we have approximately six pending patent applications in the united states and six foreign pending patent applications that have been filed 
our patent applications may not be approved 
along with the acquisition of the ams laserscope aesthetic products  we acquired a royalty free license to eleven of the ams laserscope patents 
in addition  we acquired a license to a palomar patent under which royalties are 
table of contents paid to palomar based upon a percentage of sales of certain products acquired from ams laserscope 
any patents granted now or in the future may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and development by our competitors of competing products 
moreover  our competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products either in the united states or in international markets 
patents have a limited lifetime and once a patent expires competition may increase 
for example our connector patent used to connect our delivery devices consumable durable to our laser consoles will expire in delivery devices which do not utilize our connector patent technology are not recognized by our laser consoles 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a large portion of our recurring revenue and profits from sales of our consumable endoprobe devices 
expiration of this patent may increase competition from our competitors for our consumable endoprobe device business and there can be no guarantees that we will maintain our market share of this business 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect  in part  through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain industry standard provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us without additional consideration any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions 
proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and others may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
also  our trade secrets may become known to or independently developed by competitors 
the laser and medical device industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
numerous patents are held by others  including academic institutions and our competitors 
until recently patent applications were maintained in secrecy in the united states until the patents issued 
patent applications filed in the united states after november generally will be published eighteen months after the filing date 
however  since patent applications continue to be maintained in secrecy for at least some period of time  both within the united states and with regards to international patent applications  we cannot assure you that our technology does not infringe any patents or patent applications held by third parties 
we have  from time to time  been notified of  or have otherwise been made aware of  claims that we may be infringing upon patents or other proprietary intellectual property owned by others 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or proprietary intellectual property 
although patent holders commonly offer such licenses  licenses under such patents or intellectual property may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be reasonable 
any claims  with or without merit  and regardless of whether we are successful on the merits  would be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
for example  during fiscal year  the company settled patent litigations with synergetics  inc  which was time consuming  costly and a diversion of technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding and failure to obtain necessary licenses or develop alternate technologies could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on our direct sales force and network of international distributors to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force and distributor relationships could harm our business 
our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within the united states and relationships with independent distributors outside the united states 
currently our direct sales force consists of employees and we maintain relationships with approximately independent distributors 
table of contents internationally selling our products into countries 
we generally grant our distributors exclusive territories for the sale of our products in specified countries 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our distributors to the sales of our products is not within our control 
our international sales are entirely dependent on the efforts of these third parties 
if any distributor breaches terms of its distribution agreement or fails to generate sales of our products  we may be forced to replace the distributor and our ability to sell our products into that exclusive sales territory would be adversely affected 
we do not have any long term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force 
we may be unable to replace our direct sales force personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications  which may limit our revenues and our ability to maintain market share 
the loss of the services of these key personnel would harm our business 
similarly  our distributor agreements are generally terminable at will by either party and distributors may terminate their relationships with us  which would affect our international sales and results of operations 
we have remediated the material weakness in our internal controls and procedures but still have significant deficiencies which could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our regulatory or reporting obligations we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report 
based on this evaluation  management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level and that the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our financial reporting process identified in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  has been remediated 
see item a of part ii of this annual report on form k 
during the evaluation we did note several significant deficiencies  which related to our need to establish additional controls over our accounting close process  improve our controls over demo and loaner inventory  and institute more stringent data backup and recovery procedures 
a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company s financial reporting 
we are taking steps designed to remedy the significant deficiencies noted above 
however  if despite our remediation efforts  we fail to remediate the significant deficiencies  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our disclosure controls and procedures 
it is also possible that failure to remediate the significant deficiencies discussed above or other matters may result in the company concluding in future periods that there is a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures 
even if we are to successfully remediate such significant deficiencies  because of inherent limitations  our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements or material omissions 
projections or any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  our ability to manage our business could be impaired 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our key management  technical  sales  and other critical personnel 
our officers and other key personnel are employees at will  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future 
on october   barry g 
caldwell resigned as the company s president and chief executive officer and as a member of the company s board of directors  effective as of that date 
upon mr 
caldwell s resignation  theodore a 
boutacoff  the company s current chairman of the board  returned to serve as president and chief executive officer 
mr 
boutacoff was the company s president and director from until on july   meryl a 
rains resigned as the 
table of contents company s chief financial officer 
an interim chief financial officer was hired for the interim period until james h 
mackaness was hired as full time chief financial officer on january  key personnel  including certain members of our aesthetics sales force who joined the company in connection with the acquisition of the aesthetics business of laserscope  have left the company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future 
the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives  and the results of our operations 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry and the san francisco bay area  as well as other geographic markets in which we recruit  is intense and characterized by increasing salaries  which may increase our operating expenses or hinder our ability to recruit qualified candidates 
in addition  the integration of replacement personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our product and component requirements for the manufacture of our product  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays and may experience lost sales or significant inventory carrying costs 
we use quarterly and annual forecasts based primarily on our anticipated product orders to plan our manufacturing efforts and determine our requirements for components and materials 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our product and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials 
lead times for components vary significantly and depend on numerous factors  including the specific supplier  the size of the order  contract terms and current market demand for such components 
if we overestimate the demand for our product  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate demand for our product and consequently  our component and materials requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing  delay delivery of our product to our customers and result in the loss of customer sales 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 
we depend on sole source or limited source suppliers 
we rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products  including optics  laser diodes and crystals 
we have some long term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers and currently purchase components on a purchase order basis 
some of our suppliers and manufacturers are sole or limited sources 
in addition  some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time 
for example  synergetics inc currently is the sole source supplier of the company s line of adjustable laser probes under a non exclusive agreement 
there are risks associated with the use of independent manufacturers  including the following unavailability of  shortages or limitations on the ability to obtain supplies of components in the quantities that we require  delays in delivery or failure of suppliers to deliver critical components on the dates we require  failure of suppliers to manufacture components to our specifications  and potentially reduced quality  and inability to obtain components at acceptable prices 
our business and operating results may suffer from the lack of alternative sources of supply for critical sole and limited source components 
the process of qualifying suppliers is complex  requires extensive testing with our products  and may be lengthy  particularly as new products are introduced 
new suppliers would have to be educated in our production processes 
in addition  the use of alternate components may require design alterations to our products and additional product testing under fda and relevant foreign regulatory agency guidelines  which may delay sales and increase product costs 
any failures by our vendors to adequately supply limited and 
table of contents sole source components may impair our ability to offer our existing products  delay the submission of new products for regulatory approval and market introduction  materially harm our business and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline 
establishing our own capabilities to manufacture these components would be expensive and could significantly decrease our profit margins 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to obtain components in the quantity and quality desired and at the prices we have budgeted 
we face risks associated with our collaborative and oem relationships 
our collaborators may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from collaborations with us or may not devote sufficient resources to the marketing and sale of such products 
we cannot provide assurance that these types of relationships will continue over a longer period 
our reliance on others for clinical development  manufacturing and distribution of our products may result in unforeseen problems 
further  our collaborative partners may develop or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others 
if a collaborator elects to terminate its agreement with us  our ability to develop  introduce  market and sell the product may be significantly impaired and we may be forced to discontinue altogether the product resulting from the collaboration 
we may not be able to negotiate alternative collaboration agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
the failure of any current or future collaboration efforts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on collaborative relationships to develop  introduce and market new products  product enhancements and new applications 
we depend on both clinical and commercial collaborative relationships 
we entered into a product supply agreement with ams in connection with the acquisition of the aesthetics business of laserscope  pursuant to which ams manufactured several of our aesthetics products 
with the exception of some service parts  we transitioned the manufacturing for the majority of these products to our facilities during the fourth quarter of we are party to a manufacture and supply agreement with synergetics  inc pursuant to which synergetics manufactures the company s line of adjustable laser probes on a non exclusive basis 
we have entered into collaborative relationships with academic medical centers and physicians in connection with the research and innovation and clinical testing of our products 
commercially  we currently collaborate with bausch lomb to design and manufacture a solid state green wavelength nm laser photocoagulator module for bausch lomb  called the millennium endolase module 
the millennium endolase module is designed to be a component of bausch lomb s ophthalmic surgical suite product offering and is not expected to be sold as a stand alone product 
sales of the millennium endolase module are dependent upon the actual order rate from and shipment rate to bausch lomb  which depends on the efforts of our partner and is beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our relationship with bausch lomb will result in further sales of our millennium endolase module 
the failure to obtain any additional future clinical or commercial collaborations and the resulting failure or success of such arrangements of any current or future clinical or commercial collaboration relationships could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to maintain our relationships with health care providers  customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
we market our products to numerous health care providers  including physicians  hospitals  ambulatory surgical centers  government affiliated groups and group purchasing organizations 
we have developed and strive to maintain close relationships with members of each of these groups who assist in product research and development and advise us on how to satisfy the full range of surgeon and patient needs 
we rely on these groups to recommend our products to their patients and to other members of their organizations 
the failure of our existing products and any new products we may introduce to retain the support of these various groups could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we face manufacturing risks 
the manufacture of our infrared and visible laser consoles and the related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process 
we assemble critical subassemblies and substantially all of our final products at our facility in mountain view  california 
we may experience manufacturing difficulties  quality control issues or assembly constraints  particularly with regard to new products that we may introduce 
if our sales increase substantially  including increases in the sales of our aesthetics products  we may need to increase our production capacity and may not be able to do so in a timely  effective  or cost efficient manner 
we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products  which may require that we qualify other manufacturers for our products 
furthermore  we may experience delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations and as a result  product shipments to our customers could be delayed  which would negatively impact our net revenues 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors contributing to these fluctuations include the following general economic uncertainties and political concerns  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products  product enhancements and new applications  changes in demand for our existing line of ophthalmology and aesthetics products  the cost and availability of components and subassemblies  including the willingness and ability of our sole or limited source suppliers to timely deliver components at the times and prices that we have planned  our ability to maintain sales volumes at a level sufficient to cover fixed manufacturing and operating costs  fluctuations in our product mix between ophthalmology and aesthetics products and foreign and domestic sales  our ability to address our liquidity issues should the need occur  the effect of regulatory approvals and changes in domestic and foreign regulatory requirements  introduction of new products  product enhancements and new applications by our competitors  entry of new competitors into our markets  pricing pressures and other competitive factors  our long and highly variable sales cycle  changes in the prices at which we can sell our products  changes in customers or potential customers budgets as a result of  among other things  reimbursement policies of government programs and private insurers for treatments that use our products  and increased product innovation costs 
in addition to these factors  our quarterly results have been  and are expected to continue to be  affected by seasonal factors 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expected future sales 
if sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we encountered this adverse effect on our operating results in each of the last eight quarters ended starting with the quarter ended march  through the quarter ended january  in addition  we have historically made a significant portion of each quarter s 
table of contents product shipments near the end of the quarter 
if that pattern continues  any delays in shipment of products could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for such quarter 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our past operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance 
our operating results in future quarters and years may be below expectations  which would likely cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or of significant clinical achievements  changes in market valuations of other similar companies in our industry and general market conditions 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock has been significantly adversely affected by our recent operating performance and by liquidity issues 
in the fiscal year ended january   the trading price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share 
there can be no assurance our common stock trading price will not suffer additional declines 
from time to time  we meet with investors and potential investors 
in addition  we receive attention from securities analysts and present at some analyst meetings 
our common stock may experience an imbalance between supply and demand resulting from low trading volumes 
these broad market fluctuations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock regardless of our performance 
inability of obtaining credit or material increases in interest rates may harm our sales 
some of our products are sold to health care providers in general practice 
many of these health care providers purchase our products with funds they secure through various financing arrangements with third party financial institutions  including credit facilities and short term loans 
if availability of credit becomes more limited  or interest rates increase  these financing arrangements will be harder to obtain or more expensive to our customers  which may decrease demand for our products 
any reduction in the sales of our products would cause our business to suffer 
we are subject to government regulations which may cause us to delay or withdraw the introduction of new products or new applications for our products 
the medical devices that we market and manufacture are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by foreign and state governments 
under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the related regulations  the fda regulates the design  development  clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
before a new device can be introduced into the market  the product must undergo rigorous testing and an extensive regulatory review process implemented by the fda under federal law 
unless otherwise exempt  a device manufacturer must obtain market clearance through either the k premarket notification process or the lengthier premarket approval application pma process 
depending upon the type  complexity and novelty of the device and the nature of the disease or disorder to be treated  the fda process can take several years  require extensive clinical testing and result in significant expenditures 
even if regulatory approval is obtained  later discovery of previously unknown safety issues may result in restrictions on the product  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
other countries also have extensive regulations regarding clinical trials and testing prior to new product introductions 
our failure to obtain government approvals or any delays in receipt of such approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the fda imposes additional regulations on manufacturers of approved medical devices 
we are required to comply with the applicable quality system regulations and our manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed as part of the product approval process before being utilized for commercial manufacturing 

table of contents noncompliance with the applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute 
any of these actions by the fda would materially and adversely affect our ability to continue operating our business and the results of our operations 
in addition  we are also subject to varying product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
as a result of our sales in europe  we are required to have all products ce marked  an international symbol affixed to all products demonstrating compliance with the european medical device directive and all applicable standards 
while currently all of our released products are ce marked  continued certification is based on the successful review of our quality system by our european registrar during their annual audit 
any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to comply with the fda s quality system regulation and laser performance standards our manufacturing operations could be halted  and our business would suffer 
we are currently required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr 
the qsr is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design  testing  control  manufacturing  labeling  quality assurance  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
because our products involve the use of lasers  our products also are covered by a performance standard for lasers set forth in fda regulations 
the laser performance standard imposes specific record keeping  reporting  product testing and product labeling requirements 
these requirements include affixing warning labels to laser products  as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products 
the fda enforces the qsr and laser performance standards through periodic unannounced inspections 
we have been  and anticipate in the future being  subject to such inspections 
our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse qsr inspection or our failure to comply with applicable laser performance standards could result in enforcement actions  including a public warning letter  a shutdown of our manufacturing operations  a recall of our products  civil or criminal penalties  or other sanctions  such as those described in the preceding risk factor above  which would cause our sales and business to suffer 
if we modify one of our fda approved devices  we may need to seek reapproval  which  if not granted  would prevent us from selling our modified products or cause us to redesign our products 
any modifications to an fda cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new k clearance or possibly a premarket approval 
we may not be able to obtain additional k clearance or premarket approvals for new products or for modifications to  or additional indications for  our existing products in a timely fashion  or at all 
delays in obtaining future clearance would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  which in turn would harm our revenues and future profitability 
we have made modifications to our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearance or approvals 
if the fda disagrees  and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications  we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices  which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our products 
the requirements of complying with the sarbanes oxley act of might strain our resources  which may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we are subject to a number of requirements  including the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the sarbanes oxley act of we are now required to comply with certain requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act which require management to perform an assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
these requirements might place a strain on our systems and resources 
the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective disclosure 
table of contents controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight will be required 
as a result  our management s attention might be diverted from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
in addition  we might need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge  and we might not be able to do so in a timely fashion 
because we do not require training for users of our products  and sell our products to non physicians  there exists an increased potential for misuse of our products  which could harm our reputation and our business 
federal regulations restrict the sale of our products to or on the order of licensed practitioners 
the definition of licensed practitioners varies from state to state 
as a result  our products may be purchased or operated by physicians with varying levels of training  and in many states by non physicians  including nurse practitioners and technicians 
outside the united states  many jurisdictions do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of our products 
we do not supervise the procedures performed with our products  nor do we require that direct medical supervision occur 
we  and our distributors  generally offer but do not require purchasers or operators of our products to attend training sessions 
in addition  we sometimes sell our systems to companies that rent our systems to third parties and that provide a technician to perform the procedure 
the lack of training and the purchase and use of our products by non physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes  which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation 
some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers  which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues 
laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance 
the manufacture of our lasers  laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process 
as a result of the technical complexity of our products  changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability 
to the extent that we do not achieve such yields or product reliability  our business  operating results  financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected 
we provide warranties on certain of our product sales  and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
we currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of revenues may be required in future periods 
our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition  some of our products are combined with products from other vendors  which may contain defects 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
if we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems  we could experience  among other things loss of customers  increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses  damage to our brand reputation  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  and legal actions by our customers 

table of contents the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products could be subject to recalls even after receiving fda approval or clearance 
a recall would harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we market and sell our products have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
a government mandated recall  or a voluntary recall by us  could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects  including defects in labeling 
a recall could divert management s attention  cause us to incur significant expenses  harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our future sales 
if we fail to manage growth effectively  our business could be disrupted which could harm our operating results 
we have experienced and may in the future experience growth in our business  both organically and through the acquisition of businesses and products 
we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments to enable our future growth through  among other things  new product innovation and clinical trials for new applications and products 
we must also be prepared to expand our work force and to train  motivate and manage additional employees as the need for additional personnel arises 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to effectively manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if product liability claims are successfully asserted against us  we may incur substantial liabilities that may adversely affect our business or results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims from time to time 
our products are highly complex and some are used to treat extremely delicate eye tissue and skin conditions on and near a patient s face 
we believe we maintain adequate levels of product liability insurance but product liability insurance is expensive and we might not be able to obtain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in third party coverage and reimbursement policies and any uncertainty regarding healthcare reform measures 
our ophthalmology products are typically purchased by doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users  which bill various third party payers  such as governmental programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to their patients 
third party payers are increasingly scrutinizing and challenging the coverage of new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third party payers 
while we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed  payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used  was investigational or was not cost effective 
changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products may prohibit adequate reimbursement 
there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system  reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding reimbursement of medical procedures using our products and any healthcare reform measures 
further proposed legislation  regulation and policy changes affecting third party reimbursement are likely 
we are unable to predict what legislation or 
table of contents regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us 
however  denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to catastrophic loss such as fire  flood or earthquake 
all of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in mountain view  california 
any such loss at any of our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expense to repair and replace our facilities 
our business is subject to environmental regulations 
our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental and occupational health and safety requirements of the united states and foreign countries  including those relating to discharges of substances to the air  water and land the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the cleanup of properties affected by pollutants 
failure to maintain compliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
in the future  federal  state or local governments in the united states or foreign countries could enact new or more stringent laws or issue new or more stringent regulations concerning environmental and worker health and safety matters that could affect our operations 
also  in the future  contamination may be found to exist at our current or former facilities or off site locations where we have sent wastes 
we could be held liable for such newly discovered contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
in addition  changes in environmental and worker health and safety requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition
