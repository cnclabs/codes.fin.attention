table of contents discontinued operations our financial statements were impacted by activities relating to the planned or completed divestiture of a number of our businesses 
these businesses have been accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  any operating results of these businesses are presented in our consolidated statements of income as discontinued operations  net of income tax  and all prior periods have been reclassified 
fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we decided to dispose of two automotive fastener operations 
the decision to discontinue these automotive fastener operations resulted from their non core nature coupled with further erosion in the automotive market 
these operations have been reclassified from the fasteners products segment to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold the stock of our technova entities  a foreign operation held for sale and previously recorded as discontinued from our former flow technologies pumps and valves business 
the transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million 
fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement to sell the unbrako fastener business headquartered in shannon  ireland 
the sale was completed in the second quarter of fiscal  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
unbrako was reclassified from the fastener products segment to discontinued operations 
also in the fourth quarter  we decided to sell the kladno alloy manufacturing business located in the czech republic 
kladno primarily supplied steel ingots to wyman gordon s grafton  massachusetts operation 
kladno was reclassified from the forged products segment to discontinued operations and continues to be marketed 
in january  we completed the sale of rescal for approximately million 
rescal  which is located in france  was acquired with smc and was held for sale since the first quarter of fiscal the sale of the business generated a tax effected gain of million  or per share diluted in the fourth quarter of fiscal in january  we completed the sale of shape memory alloys sma for million 
the sma business was acquired with smc in the first quarter of fiscal  and was reclassified from the forged products segment to discontinued operations during the third quarter of fiscal the sale of the business generated a tax effected gain of million  or per share diluted  of which million  or per share diluted  was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we sold our interest in wyman gordon frisa to our joint venture partner for million in cash 
in addition  the buyer assumed and subsequently repaid million of debt upon closing 
at the time of the closing  the joint venture entity operated a manufacturing facility located in mexico that was engaged in the manufacture of forged products using the ring rolling process 
frisa was reclassified from the forged products segment to discontinued operations 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we decided to sell the refiner rebuild business of j l fiber services and close our aft composites business 
these businesses were reclassified from the former industrial products segment now the fastener products segment to discontinued operations 
both transactions were completed during the third quarter of fiscal restructuring  asset impairment and other non recurring charges we regularly assess our cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions  taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets we serve 
the following restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal and 
table of contents fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of million pursuant to plans to downsize operations across all segments 
we had been gearing up for aerospace growth into fiscal  whereas future demand now appears to be flattening out  particularly in the casting and forging aerospace markets 
the charges consisted of million for employee severance expenses and million for impairments and relocation expenses related with long lived assets 
these restructuring plans provided for terminations of approximately employees in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and first quarter of fiscal the restructuring and impairment charges recorded by the investment cast products segment  forged products segment and fastener products segment were million  million and million  respectively  during fiscal as of march   million remained in accrued liabilities related to the restructuring plans 
the tax effected impact of these charges was million  or per share diluted 
fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the investment cast products segment recorded restructuring charges of million  primarily for shut down costs associated with an underutilized machining operation located in the united kingdom 
the tax effected impact of these charges was million  or per share diluted 
overall outlook  impacts of the global economic recession and program delays recent economic events have created recessionary economic conditions in many industries and created a crisis in global financial markets including commercial credit markets 
while we are not immune to impacts of the current global recession  we believe our strong financial position will enable us to take advantage of opportunities in our markets served and continue to make operational improvements in our businesses 
during the recently completed fiscal  approximately percent of our sales were to customers in the global aerospace markets 
until the recent economic events occurred  we believed  based on customer forecasts  that the aerospace production rates would continue to experience growth throughout fiscal and possibly beyond  particularly due to anticipated build rates of major new aerospace programs such as the boeing and airbus a  each of which contains significant per ship set revenue for pcc 
we had built up our employee base in anticipation of that growth 
we believe that although aerospace production rates will remain flat for fiscal as compared with fiscal levels  sales will be negatively impacted by inventory corrections due in part to delays in both the boeing and airbus a programs 
we still believe that these programs will represent significant future revenue streams for the company  but the revenues will be recognized later than originally anticipated 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized restructuring charges of million before income taxes  which primarily related to downsizing the workforce in anticipation of the moderating future aerospace growth in the near term 
we have  however  been able to increase our market share in aerospace  particularly in the fasteners products segment 
our most significant customers in the aerospace industry are primarily large  well financed businesses that we believe have the ability to weather the economic downturn 
therefore  while there is significant uncertainty as to the direction of the economy in future periods  we do not anticipate significant collection issues with our accounts receivable or marketability of our in process inventories 
however  our customers depend on demand from their end use customers  as well as the end use customers financial viability  of which we are unable to make an assessment 
we must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our sales were to customers in the global power generation markets  which include our igt business as well as sales of our seamless extruded pipe 
we expect steady demand in both of these product lines due to demand rates  large current sales backlogs and our ability to win further market share 
our most significant customers in the power generation markets are primarily large  well financed businesses that we believe should have the ability to weather the economic downturn or are customers for which sales are backed by letters of credit on which we believe there is little risk of default 
therefore  we do not anticipate significant collection issues with our accounts receivable or marketability of our in process inventories 
however  our customers depend on demand from their end use customers  as well as the end use customers financial viability  of which we are unable to make an assessment 
we must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment 

table of contents the remaining percent of our sales in fiscal were into general industrial markets  including the automotive markets 
it is difficult to summarize the opportunities and challenges in these markets  because the circumstances vary widely from one individual market to another 
we have taken  and will continue to take  precautionary measures with customers in these markets to limit our exposure  to the extent possible  to potential bankruptcies and other financial issues experienced by these customers 
these measures include shortening cash collection terms  regular updating of credit profiles  discontinuance of further business with customers not paying in a timely manner and the requirement of cash in advance of shipments  among others 
due to the diversity of markets and customer profiles in these businesses and the precautionary steps referred to previously  we do not anticipate severe impacts on our business or significant exposure to credit losses in these markets 
however  it is reasonably possible that we may experience unanticipated unfavorable impacts 
we follow an investment philosophy of diversified investing and risk mitigation when managing our pension plans 
the investments in our pension plans  which totaled approximately billion as of the end of fiscal  have experienced investment losses that averaged approximately percent during fiscal this compares with our weighted average expected long term annual investment return of percent for us plans and percent for us plans 
the losses on our pension investments will result in increased net periodic pension expense in fiscal in the first month of fiscal  we contributed million to our defined benefit pension plans  including a voluntary contribution of million  to increase plan funding and to mitigate the impact of these pension investment losses on our income in future years 
we believe our financial position and liquidity will allow us to make all required pension contributions as well as any additional voluntary contributions that management deems advisable 
at this time  the company does not expect to make any additional voluntary contributions to the defined benefit pension plans in fiscal see the changes in financial condition and liquidity section for a discussion of the impact of the global financial climate and credit shortage on liquidity

contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by percentage points in fiscal compared to percentage points last year 
the investment cast products segment anticipates slightly reduced sales in fiscal  primarily driven by decreased demand from commercial aerospace as the industry completes inventory corrections in the first half of the fiscal year to adjust from previous growth expectations 

continued weakness in international currencies would also impact this segment 
reduced aerospace sales and negative currency impact are expected to be partially offset by continued growth in power generation sales  with additional capacity utilized to support this growth 
operating margins  as a percent of sales  are expected to improve in fiscal as a result of continued improvements in operating efficiencies 
fiscal compared with fiscal the investment cast products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  an increase of percent from the prior year s sales of  million

while the majority of the higher material costs were recovered from contractual terms allowing for pass through pricing to protect operating income  they dilute operating income as a percent of sales 
contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by percentage points in fiscal compared to percentage points last year 

table of contents forged products the forged products segment includes the operations of wyman gordon and smc  which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal these businesses manufacture forged components from sophisticated titanium and nickel based alloys principally for the aerospace and power generation markets  or manufacture nickel and cobalt based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non aerospace markets which include products for oil and gas  chemical processing  and pollution control applications 
the segment also provides nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions  re melting various material byproducts and reusing them in casting  forging  and fastener manufacturing processes 
forged products sales to the aerospace and power generation markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the investment cast products segment  with additional aerospace sales to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components

the acquisition of hackney ladish in the third quarter of fiscal contributed approximately million in incremental sales over the prior year 
the decrease in sales from the prior year reflects the decline in external selling prices of nickel alloy from the segment s three primary mills  which negatively impacted external sales by approximately million in fiscal versus fiscal nickel prices decreased approximately percent on the lme compared to fiscal in addition  we estimate fiscal was negatively impacted by the boeing strike by approximately million 
in fiscal  the forged products segment dedicated more resources for internal production which impacted top line revenues by approximately million 
in addition  the segment s foreign operations reported approximately million in reduced us dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the us dollar relative to international currencies  primarily the british pound and australian dollar 
these declines were partially offset by a percent increase in extruded pipe sales 
fiscal sales also include million of higher contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs  compared to million last year

operating income as a percent of sales is expected to show improvement  benefiting from the expected increase in extruded pipe sales and further cost reduction initiatives 
fiscal compared with fiscal the forged products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  an increase of percent from the previous year s sales of  million 
approximately million or percent of the increase in sales reflects the acquisitions of mcwilliams and caledonian

the growth in aerospace sales included approximately million related to airdrome and fti  which were acquired in the third quarter of fiscal the segment overcame negative pressures due to the boeing strike  which accounted for a decrease in fastener products sales of approximately million in fiscal additional negative impacts to sales in this segment included the continuation of a depressed north american automotive market  coupled with softening in both the european and brazilian automotive markets  as well as weakness in other areas of the general industrial market 
in addition  our foreign operations reported approximately million in reduced us dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the us dollar relative to international currencies  primarily the british pound and brazilian real 
operating income for the fasteners segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the improvement in operating margins reflected leverage from the increased sales volume and increased sales in the higher margin aerospace business  as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes 
this was slightly offset by the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  which had a negative impact of approximately million on operating income in fiscal fastener products segment sales are expected to be relatively flat during fiscal as a result of decreased demand from aerospace customers primarily in the business jet and distributor businesses  partially offset by continued market share gains and a full year of sales from the acquisitions that were completed in the third quarter of fiscal continued weakness in international currencies would also impact this segment 
operating income as a percent of sales is expected to improve due to continuing cost take outs 
fiscal compared with fiscal the fastener products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  a percent increase from fiscal sales of  million 
the increase in sales primarily resulted from higher sales from the aerospace fastener operations  of which approximately million represented incremental sales from a full year of cherry aerospace  acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal sales from the engineered fastener and industrial products operations decreased percent year over year  principally due to weaker demand from the automotive industry 
operating income for the fasteners segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the improvement in operating margins reflected leverage from the increased sales volume and increased sales in the higher margin aerospace business  as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes 
interest and taxes net interest expense in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the lower net interest expense was due to significantly reduced debt levels  lower borrowing rates  and higher interest income earned on higher average cash balances compared to the prior year 
net interest expense in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the lower net interest expense in fiscal was due to reduced debt levels  lower borrowing rates  and higher interest income compared to the previous year 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  percentage points higher than the percent effective tax rate in fiscal the increase in tax rate was principally due to reduced tax benefits from lower foreign tax rates  a decrease in benefits from the us manufacturing deduction due to increased tax deductions for pension contributions  and a reduction in favorable audit settlements year over year  partially offset by an increase in benefits from the federal research credit 

table of contents the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  compared with percent in fiscal the slight increase in tax rate was principally due to reduced tax benefits from audit settlements in fiscal compared to fiscal  and the loss of the extraterritorial income exclusion benefit in  which was partially offset by a larger us manufacturing deduction in compared to liquidity and capital resources total assets of  million at march  represented a million increase from the  million balance at march   principally reflecting a million addition of total assets from the acquisitions of airdrome  fatigue and hackney ladish  in addition to million of higher cash balances 
partially offsetting this increase was lower accounts receivable balances due to lower external sales and the timing of sales and customer payments 
total capitalization at march   was  million  consisting of million of debt and  million of equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio improved to at march  from at the end of fiscal  reflecting the impact of reduced debt resulting from strong cash flows from operations and the impact of increased equity from earnings 
cash as of march  was million  up million from the end of fiscal  and total debt was million including million from discontinued operations  down million since the end of fiscal the net positive cash flow of million reflects cash generation from operations of  million and million from the issuance of common stock and related tax benefits  partially offset by million of cash paid for the acquisitions of airdrome  fatigue and hackney ladish  capital expenditures of million  effect of exchange rate changes of million  and cash dividends of million 
capital spending of million in fiscal principally provided for additional capacity expansion  cost reduction and equipment upgrades throughout the company 
the capital spending plan for fiscal  which is anticipated to be approximately to percent lower than capital spending in fiscal  provides for equipment maintenance and upgrades  cost reduction and certain capacity expansion projects throughout the company 
during fiscal  we contributed million to the defined benefit pension plans  of which million was voluntary 
in addition  we contributed million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal year in the first month of fiscal  we contributed million to the defined benefit pension plans  of which million was voluntary 
we expect to contribute approximately million of required contributions in fiscal  for total contributions to the defined benefit pension plans of approximately million in fiscal in addition  we expect to contribute approximately million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal year we believe we will be able to meet our short and longer term liquidity needs for working capital  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  capital spending  cash dividends  scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations  borrowing from our existing billion revolving credit facility or new bank credit facilities  the issuance of public or privately placed debt securities  or the issuance of equity instruments 
as noted above  our revolving bank credit facility credit agreement provides available borrowing up to billion through may our unused borrowing capacity as of march  was million under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains various standard financial covenants  including maintenance of minimum net worth  interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio 
the financial covenants in the credit agreement are our most restrictive covenants 
our covenant requirements and actual ratios as of march  were as follows dollars in millions covenant requirement actual consolidated minimum net worth  minimum  consolidated interest coverage ratio minimum consolidated leverage ratio maximum terms are defined in the amended and restated credit agreement filed as an exhibit to form k on october  
table of contents as of march   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of our loan agreements 
historically  we have also issued commercial paper as a method of raising short term liquidity 
we believe we continue to have the ability to issue commercial paper  even in the current credit markets  and have issued minor amounts of commercial paper in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter to cover short term cash requirements 
we do not anticipate any changes in our ability to borrow under our current credit facility  but changes in the financial condition of the participating financial institutions could negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future 
should that circumstance arise  we believe that we would be able to arrange any needed financing  although we are not able to predict what the terms of any such borrowings would be  or the source of the borrowed funds  due to the current instability in the global credit markets 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements 
the following table represents our contractual cash obligations as of march  and the estimated timing of future cash payments contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt acquisition related obligation total operating lease obligations include million attributable to an operation held for sale 
interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions on march  was million 
due to the uncertainties associated with settling these liabilities  we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these liabilities 
as a result  our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is excluded from the table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
the table above also excludes estimated required cash contributions to our qualified pension plans totaling approximately million over the next five years million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal due to the million voluntary contribution made in the first month of fiscal  actual required cash contributions in future years are expected to be less than the amounts stated above 
we also have benefit payments due under our non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout the management s discussion and analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
note that the preparation of this annual report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue 
valuation of inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the estimated market value of the inventory 
cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age  historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangibles from time to time  we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at a minimum each fiscal year in the second quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
our reporting units consist of the three operating segments within our investment cast products reportable operating segment and the two operating segments within our forged products reportable operating segment as well as a number of reporting units in our fasteners products operating segment 
the fasteners products operating segment includes several aggregated component units referred to as the fasteners products reporting unit and three other reporting units for which the segment manager regularly reviews performance 
during fiscal  pcc precision tool group ptg was included in the fasteners group reporting unit as the business is closely related and integral to the fasteners group reporting unit 
during fiscal  ptg was a separate reporting unit 
we performed an impairment test for the fasteners products reporting unit as a result of this change and no impairment was indicated 
there were no other changes to our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing during fiscal and testing for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations 
such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows  expected market growth rates  our estimates of sales volumes  sales prices and related costs  and the discount rate applied  which reflects the weighted average cost of capital 
management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated  however  estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements potentially resulting in impairment of the goodwill 
we also consider comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the cash flow models used to determine fair value are most sensitive to the expected future cash flows and the discount rate for each reporting unit 
the discount rate used in the cash flow models for the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis averaged 
the annual growth rate for earnings before interest and taxes varied by reporting unit and ranged from to over the initial five year forecast period 
a sensitivity analysis determined that using terminal growth rates of  or would not result in impairment in the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on both of these factors and determined that the forecast for future earnings before interest and taxes used in the cash flow model could decrease by and the discount rate used could increase by a factor of from the rate utilized  and the goodwill of our reporting units 
table of contents would not be impaired 
the reporting unit that would be most sensitive to worsening economic conditions has million of goodwill recorded as of march  other than the change in reporting units within the fasteners operating segment  there were no triggering events during the third and fourth quarters requiring a goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
environmental costs the estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of amounts is established  and no amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable 
adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but any amounts  and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued  are not reasonably estimable at this time 
total environmental reserves accrued at march  and march  were million and million  respectively 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations covered by this interpretation include those for which an entity has a significant obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
in accordance with sfas no 
and fin  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
currently  we have identified a known asset retirement obligation associated with environmental contamination at one of our manufacturing facilities 
however  we have not recognized a liability under fin for this retirement obligation because the fair value of remediation at this site cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time 
the settlement date is unknown because remediation of this site is not required until production ceases  and we have no current or future plans to cease production 
this asset retirement obligation  when estimable  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or business 
income taxes provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
beginning in fiscal  we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
as a result  we report a liability resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

plan assets have been valued at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements 

table of contents pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions  including the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate 
we derive a market based discount rate from yields on high quality  liquid fixed income securities at a specific measurement period  at the end of our fiscal year for valuation of our pension liabilities 
we use only highly rated bonds aa aa or higher to estimate the interest rate at which our pension benefits could be settled 
our assumed return on plan assets is derived from a review of past performance  anticipated future performance in light of market conditions and our investment allocation and consultation with our investment advisors 
as the assumed rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption  it is not anticipated to be as volatile as the discount rate  which is a point in time measurement 
for our us plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the and net periodic pension cost 
for our non us plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the and net periodic pension cost 
for our us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our march  measurement date 
for our non us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our march  measurement date 
for fiscal  our us net periodic pension expense was million and non us net periodic pension income was million 
we estimate that for fiscal  our us net periodic pension expense will be approximately million and non us net periodic pension income will be approximately million 
the table below quantifies the approximate impact  as of march   of a one quarter percentage point decrease in our assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets  holding other assumptions constant 
percentage point decrease increase in annual costs discount rate expected long term rate of return increase in projected benefit obligation discount rate the approximate impact  as of march   of a one percentage point increase in our assumption for the health care cost trend rate  holding other assumptions constant  on our total service and interest cost components and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is not significant
