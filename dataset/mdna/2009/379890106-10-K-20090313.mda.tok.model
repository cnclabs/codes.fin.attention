overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business 
we believe that an understanding of these trends is important to understand our financial results for fiscal  as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
financial results and trends revenues for were million  a increase over  in which we reported revenues of million 
this increase was primarily driven by our acquisitions of mig and superscape 
however  the increase was offset by a decrease in growth of our sales in our carrier based business  resulting primarily from a decrease in the growth of handset unit sales  which in turn led to a decrease in the growth in the number of games that we sold 
our revenue growth rate will continue to depend significantly on continued growth in the mobile games market and our ability to continue to attract new end users in that market  purchases of new mobile handsets  and the overall strength of the economy  particularly in the us our future revenues would be adversely affected if there were a continued slowdown in the growth of our carrier business  which we expect will generate the vast majority of our revenues in in addition  our revenue growth rate may be adversely impacted by decisions by our carriers to alter their customer terms for downloading our games 
for example  verizon wireless  our largest carrier  imposes a data surcharge to download content on those verizon customers who have not otherwise subscribed to a data plan 
our revenues depend on a variety of other factors  including our relationships with our carriers and licensors 
even if mobile games based on licensed content or brands remain popular with end users  any of our licensors could decide not to renew our existing license or not to license additional intellectual property to us and instead license to our competitors or develop and publish their own mobile games or other applications  competing with us in the marketplace 
the loss of any key relationships with our carriers or licensors could impact our revenues in the future 
we expect our revenues to be lower than our revenues  and in future periods  our revenues could continue to decline 

table of contents our net loss in was million versus a net loss of million in this increase was driven by royalty impairments of million  goodwill impairments of million and additional operating expenses associated with the acquisitions of mig and superscape 
if our revenues are lower than we anticipate  we will be required to reduce our operating expenses to remain in compliance with our financial covenants 
however  reducing our operating expenses will be very challenging for us  since we undertook restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of that reduced our operating expenses significantly from second quarter levels 
should we be required to further reduce operating expenses  it could have the effect of reducing our revenues 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december  totaled million  a decrease of million from million at december  this decrease is primarily due to million net cash paid in march for the superscape acquisition  net of cash acquired  and million for prepaid license agreements 
our cash balance at december  includes million from the redemption  at full par value  of our previously impaired auction rate securities 
see liquidity and capital resources  later in this item for more information 
significant transactions in march  we acquired superscape  a global publisher of mobile games  to deepen and broaden our game library  gain access to d game development resources and to augment our internal production and publishing resources with a studio in moscow  russia 
we paid pence pound sterling in cash for each issued share of superscape for a total purchase price of million  consisting of cash consideration of million and transaction costs of million 
due to decreases in our long term forecasts and current market capitalization the entire goodwill resulting from the superscape acquisition was impaired during the year ended december  in december  we acquired mig to accelerate our presence in china  deepen our relationship with china mobile  the largest wireless carrier in china  acquire access and rights to leading franchises for the chinese market  and augment our internal production and publishing resources with a studio in china 
we purchased all of mig s then outstanding shares for a total purchase price of million  consisting of cash consideration to mig shareholders of million and transaction costs of million 
as a result of the attainment of the revenue and operating income milestones in by mig  we were committed to pay the million in additional consideration to the mig shareholders and the million of bonuses to two officers of mig 
due to our current cash positions and liquidity concerns  in december  we restructured the timing and nature of these payments in december and issued to former shareholders of mig an aggregate of million in promissory notes  which are due in and due to decreases in our long term forecasts and current market capitalization a portion of the goodwill resulting from the mig acquisition was impaired during the year ended december  in march  we completed our ipo in which we sold and issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share to the public 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time these estimates and judgments are made  actual results may differ from those estimates  which could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following to be critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition or results of operations and they require critical management estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  advance or guaranteed licensor royalty payments  
table of contents short term investments  business combinations purchase accounting  long lived assets  goodwill  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we estimate revenues from carriers in the current period when reasonable estimates of these amounts can be made 
several carriers provide reliable interim preliminary reporting and others report sales data within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month  both of which allow us to make reasonable estimates of revenues and therefore to recognize revenues during the reporting period when the end user licenses the game 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
our estimates for revenues include consideration of factors such as preliminary sales data  carrier specific historical sales trends  the age of games and the expected impact of newly launched games  successful introduction of new handsets  promotions during the period and economic trends 
when we receive the final carrier reports  to the extent not received within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month  we record any differences between estimated revenues and actual revenues in the reporting period when we determine the actual amounts 
historically  the revenues on the final revenue report have not differed by more than one half of of the reported revenues for the period  which we deemed to be immaterial 
revenues earned from certain carriers may not be reasonably estimated 
if we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of revenue to be recognized in the current period  we recognize revenues upon the receipt of a carrier revenue report and when our portion of a game s licensed revenues is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
to monitor the reliability of our estimates  our management  where possible  reviews the revenues by carrier and by game on a weekly basis to identify unusual trends such as differential adoption rates by carriers or the introduction of new handsets 
if we deem a carrier not to be creditworthy  we defer all revenues from the arrangement with that carrier until we receive payment and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
advance or guaranteed licensor royalty payments our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments  which are payable regardless of the ultimate volume of sales to end users 
in accordance with fsp fin  application of fasb interpretation no 
to minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owner  we recorded a minimum guaranteed liability of approximately million as of december  when no significant performance remains with the licensor  we initially record each of these guarantees as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount 
we believe that the contractual amount represents the fair value of our liability 
when significant performance remains with the licensor  we record royalty payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than upon execution of the contract 
we classify minimum royalty payment obligations as current liabilities to the extent they are contractually due within the next twelve months 
each quarter  we also evaluate the realization of our royalties as well as any unrecognized guarantees not yet paid to determine amounts that we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
we use estimates of revenues  cash flows and net margins to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties and guarantees 
this evaluation considers multiple factors  including the term of the agreement  forecasted demand  game life cycle status  game development plans and current and anticipated sales levels 
to the extent that this evaluation indicates that the remaining prepaid and guaranteed royalty payments are not recoverable  we record an impairment charge in the period such impairment is indicated 
subsequently  if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  amounts of prepaid royalties previously written down may be utilized  resulting in lower cost of revenues and higher income from operations than previously expected in that period 
during  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  zero and  respectively 
the impairments we recorded in 
table of contents were predominantly related to distribution agreements in emea whose actual and forecasted sales have not met our initial expectations and will not generate sufficient revenues to recoup our royalty commitment 
short term investments we invested in auction rate securities that are bought and sold in the marketplace through a bidding process sometimes referred to as a dutch auction 
after the initial issuance of the securities  the interest rate on the securities is reset periodically  at intervals set at the time of issuance eg  every seven  or days or every six months  based on the market demand at the reset period 
the stated or contractual maturities for these securities  however  generally are to years 
as of december   we had no investments in auction rate securities 
as of december   we had million of principal invested in two auction rate securities  each of which were rated aaa as of the date of the investment  with contractual maturities of we periodically review our investments for impairment 
in the event the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  we write down the value of the investment to its fair value 
we recorded an  write down due to a decline in fair value of two failed auctions as of december  that was determined to be other than temporary based on quantitative and qualitative assumptions and estimates using valuation models including a firm liquidation quote provided by the sponsoring broker and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors including the use of cash for the two recent acquisitions  the ratings of the underlying securities  our intent to continue to hold these securities and the continued and further deterioration in the auction rate securities market 
these securities were redeemed at their respective par values by the sponsoring broker in the fourth quarter of  resulting in an  realized gain for the year ended december  business combinations purchase accounting under the purchase method of accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing purchased technology  customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
see goodwill below 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we recognize impairment based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
during the quarter ended december   the global economic conditions that affect our industry have deteriorated as evidenced by the decline in our stock price  resulting in a significant reduction in our market capitalization 
based on the guidance of sfas  we determined that we had a triggering event and tested our purchased intangible assets for recoverability 
accordingly  we performed an assessment of our purchased intangible assets to test for recoverability in accordance with sfas 
table of contents in accordance with sfas  the company s long lived assets and liabilities are tested at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows 
the company estimated the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the long lived assets and then compared the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
the cash flow period was based on the remaining useful lives of the primary asset in each long lived asset group which ranges from to years 
the result of the analysis indicated that the estimated undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
accordingly  no intangible asset impairments were recorded 
given the current macro economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the potential impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the long lived asset impairment tests during will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow  revenue and margin growth rates of certain long lived assets are not achieved  it is reasonably possible that an impairment review may be triggered 
if a triggering event causes an impairment review to be required  it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such charge would be material 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives but rather test them for impairment 
sfas requires us to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance at least annually  which we do as of september each year  and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in our impairment reviews  we look at the goodwill allocated to our reporting units the americas  emea and apac 
sfas requires a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in step one of our annual impairment analysis  we determined the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market prices 
we also compared the results of the income approach and the results of the market approach for reasonableness 
significant assumptions used in our income approach analysis included expected future revenue growth rates ranging from to  operating profit margins ranging from to  working capital levels of of revenues  asset lives used to generate future cash flows  discount rates ranging from to  and a terminal growth rate of 
the fair value of the reporting units was then compared to their carrying values 
under both comparisons  the results indicated the fair value of our apac reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore  no further analysis was performed 
however  the step one analysis for the americas and emea reporting units indicated that their fair values were less than their carrying values  which required us to perform step two for each 
in step two of our annual impairment analysis  we allocated the fair value of the americas and emea reporting units to all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a hypothetical sale transaction to determine the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit s goodwill 
as a result of our step two analysis  we concluded that all million of the goodwill attributed to the emea reporting unit and million of the million of the goodwill attributed to the americas reporting unit was impaired 
therefore  our total non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of was million 
during fourth quarter of  the global economic conditions that affect our industry have deteriorated as evidenced by the decline in our stock price  resulting in a significant reduction in our market capitalization 
based on the guidance of sfas  we determined that we had a triggering event that required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment review as of december  in step one of our interim impairment analysis  we determined the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market prices 
we also compared the results of the income approach and the results of the market approach for reasonableness 
significant assumptions used in our income approach analysis included expected future revenue growth rates ranging from to  operating profit margins ranging from to  working capital levels of of revenues  asset lives used to generate future 
table of contents cash flows  discount rates ranging from to  and a terminal growth rate of 
the fair value of the reporting units was then compared to their carrying values 
under both comparisons  the results indicated the fair value of our americas and apac reporting units indicated that their fair values were less than their carrying values  which required us to perform step two for each 
in step two of our interim impairment analysis  we allocated the fair value of the americas and apac reporting units to all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a hypothetical sale transaction to determine the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit s goodwill 
as a result of our step two analysis  we concluded that all million of the goodwill remaining that had been attributed to the americas reporting unit and million of the million of the goodwill attributed to the apac reporting unit was impaired 
therefore  our total non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of was million 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of the reporting units  the assigning of assets and liabilities to reporting units  the assigning of goodwill to reporting units and the determining of the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments and assumptions include the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including forecasted revenues and costs based on current titles under contract  forecasted new titles that we expect to release  timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and growth rates in terminal values 
the market comparable approach estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company market multiples of publicly traded firms in similar lines of business 
the use of the market comparable approach requires judgments regarding the comparability of companies with lines of business similar to ours 
this process is particularly difficult in a situation where no domestic public mobile games companies exist 
the factors used in the selection of comparable companies include growth characteristics as measured by revenue or other financial metrics  margin characteristics  product defined markets served  customer defined markets served  the size of a company as measured by financial metrics such as revenue or market capitalization  the competitive position of a company  such as whether it is a market leader in terms of indicators like market share  and company specific issues that suggest appropriateness or inappropriateness of a particular company as a comparable 
further  the total gross value calculated under each method was not materially different  and therefore if the weighting were different we do not believe that this would have significantly impacted our conclusion 
if different comparable companies had been used  the market multiples and resulting estimates of the fair value of our stock would also have been different 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit  which could trigger impairment 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which supersedes our previous accounting under apb no 
sfas r requires the recognition of compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to all share based payments including stock options 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model 
to value awards granted on or after january   we used the black scholes option pricing model  which requires  among other inputs  an estimate of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and assumptions as to volatility of our stock over the term of the related options  the expected term of the options  the risk free interest rate and the option forfeiture rate 
we determined the assumptions used in this pricing model at each grant date 
we concluded that it was not practicable to calculate the volatility of our share price since our securities have been publicly traded for a limited period of time 
therefore  we based expected volatility on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded entities 
we determined the expected term of our options based upon historical exercises  post vesting cancellations and the options contractual term 
we based the risk free rate for the expected term of the option on the us treasury constant maturity rate as of the grant date 
we determined the forfeiture rate based upon our historical experience with option cancellations adjusted for unusual or infrequent events 
in  and  we recorded total employee non cash stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
in future periods  stock based compensation expense may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 
additionally  sfas r requires that we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of stock options 
table of contents that are expected to vest 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from that estimated by management  we may be required to record adjustments to stock based compensation expense in future periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax benefit provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current income tax benefit provision together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
as of december  and  our valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets was million and million  respectively 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  we would need to make an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset  which would increase income in the period that determination was made 
on january  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the adoption date was  our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we do not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next months 
we have not provided federal income taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  other than china  because these earnings are intended to be reinvested permanently 
during the fourth quarter of we changed our assertion such that foreign earnings of one china subsidiary are no longer intended to be indefinitely reinvested in accordance with apb no 
as a result we analyzed the need to record deferred taxes related to the foreign undistributed earnings 
no deferred tax asset was recognized since we do not believe the deferred tax asset will reverse in the foreseeable future 
there was no significant impact of this change in assertion on the provision for or benefit from income tax 
results of operations the following sections discuss and analyze the changes in the significant line items in our statements of operations for the comparison periods identified 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues year ended december  in thousands revenues our revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in  due primarily to revenues from mig and superscape  our catalog of titles  broader international distribution reach and increased unit sales of our games 
no revenues from mig or superscape titles were recorded during the year ended december  compared to million recorded during the year ended december  due to the 
table of contents diversification of our product portfolio  including the titles resulting from the acquisitions of mig and superscape  we were not dependent on any single title in international revenues  defined as revenues generated from carriers whose principal operations are located outside the united states  increased million from million in to million in  primarily as a result of increased sales in apac  emea and other developing markets  including latin america 
cost of revenues year ended december  in thousands cost of revenues royalties impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees amortization of intangible assets total cost of revenues revenues gross margin our cost of revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase resulted from an increase in royalties  impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees  and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
royalties increased million principally because of higher revenues with associated royalties  including those acquired from superscape 
revenues attributable to games based upon branded intellectual property decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in as a result of sales of games based on original intellectual property ip developed by mig and superscape 
the average royalty rate that we paid on games based on licensed intellectual property increased from in to in primarily as a result of our new distribution arrangements with higher royalty rates 
as a result of the increase in royalty rates for branded titles and the impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees  overall royalties as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in the increase in impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees of million in primarily related to large distribution deals in emea that have not performed nor do we believe will perform as initially expected 
amortization of intangible assets increased by million as the completion of amortization for certain intangible assets acquired from macrospace and ifone was offset by the commencement of amortization of intangible assets acquired in from mig and superscape 
research and development expenses year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses percentage of revenues our research and development expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in research and development costs was due to additional costs related to the mig and superscape acquisitions and primarily related to payroll and benefit costs of million  allocated facilities and facility related costs of million  and outside services costs of million 
we had employees in research and development as of december  compared to as of december a restructuring that we affected in the fourth quarter of resulted in the elimination of research and development employees  but due to the net increase in employees our salaries and benefits related costs had increased as a result 
research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses increased from in to in 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses year ended december  in thousands sales and marketing expenses percentage of revenues our sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was attributable to increases of million for the mig earn out expense  which was recorded in sales and marketing as the two former officers of mig carried out customer and selling related activities  million in stock based compensation  million in salaries and benefits  as we increased our sales and marketing headcount in  million in allocated facilities costs and million in marketing promotion costs 
we increased staffing to expand our marketing efforts for our games and the glu brand  increase sales efforts to our new and existing wireless carriers and expand our sales and marketing operations into the asia pacific and latin america regions 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from in to in as our sales and marketing activities generated more revenues across a greater number of carriers and mobile handsets 
sales and marketing expenses included million of stock based compensation expense in and million in  the majority of which related to the stock component of the mig earnout that was to be issued before we renegotiated the payment terms in december general and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses percentage of revenues our general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a million increase in accounting  consulting and professional fees  million increase in sales  use and business tax fees  million increase in salaries and benefits and million in depreciation and facilities related costs  partially offset by a reduction in travel  equipment and stock based compensation expense 
we increased our general and administrative headcount from in to in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in as a result of the overall growth of our revenues  which resulted in economies of scale in our general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense of million in and million in other operating expenses we had no restructuring charge in and million in of the total restructuring charge recorded  million was recorded in the united states   was recorded in emea and  was recorded in apac 
we expect that the personnel related restructuring costs of million will be paid in full by march  our acquired in process research and development increased from million related to the mig acquisition in to million related to the superscape acquisition in the ipr d charges recorded in and were related to the development of new games 
we determined the value of acquired ipr d from superscape using a discounted cash flows approach 
we calculated the present value of expected future cash flows attributable to the in process technology using a discount rate 
this rate took into account the percentage of completion of the development effort ranging from approximately to and the risks associated with our developing technology given changes in trends and technology in our industry 
as of december   all acquired ipr d projects had been completed at a cost similar to the original projections 

table of contents our goodwill impairment increased from zero in to million in as the carrying values of our americas  apac and emea reporting units exceeded their fair values at the time of our annual and interim impairment tests 
these assessments were based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
our gain on sale of assets decreased from million in to zero in in  we recorded a one time gain on sale of assets of million related to the sale of provisionx software to a third party in february under the terms of the agreement  we will co own the intellectual property rights to the provisionx software  excluding any alterations or modifications following the sale  by the third party 
based on our current revenue and expense projections  we expect that our various operating expense categories will decline as a percentage of revenues 
we could fail to increase our revenues as anticipated  and we could decide to increase expenses in one or more categories to respond to competitive pressures or for other reasons 
in these cases and others  it is possible that one or more of our operating expense categories would not decline as a percentage of revenues 
other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  decreased from an income of million in to a net expense of million in this decrease was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses of million but partially offset by a  gain in for the redemption of the auction rate securities that were written down in additionally  our interest expense decreased  due to reduced debt outstanding as our million loan was repaid in march this decrease in interest expense was offset by a million decrease in our interest income in as a result of our lower cash balances due to our cash outlays for the acquisitions of mig and superscape 
we expect our interest expense to increase in the future as a result of our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and the notes issued to the former shareholders of mig 
income tax benefit provision income tax benefit provision decreased from a benefit of million in to a provision of million in as a result of taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions  changes in the valuation allowance and increased foreign withholding taxes resulting from increased sales in countries with withholding tax requirements 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues year ended december  in thousands revenues our revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in  due primarily to increased revenue per title  including our top ten titles  new titles  our growing catalog of titles  broader international distribution reach and increased adoption rates for mobile game users 
the increase resulted from sales of games that we have released in  including centipede  project gotham racing  sonic jump and transformers as well as the continued success of titles released in prior years including deer hunter  world series of poker and zuma 
revenues in from games released in were million 
revenues from our top ten titles increased from million in to million in international revenues  defined as revenues generated from carriers whose principal operations are located outside the united states  increased million from million in to million in 
table of contents cost of revenues year ended december  in thousands cost of revenues royalties impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees amortization of intangible assets total cost of revenues revenues gross margin our cost of revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase resulted from an increase in royalties due to higher sales volumes and an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets  which was offset by a decrease in impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees

we expect to continue to use cash in our operating activities during at least the first half of because of anticipated net operating losses 
additionally  we may decide to enter into new licensing arrangements for existing or new licensed intellectual properties that may require us to make royalty payments at the outset of the agreement 
if we do sign these agreements  this could significantly increase our future use of cash in operating activities

sufficiency of current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments our cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  during the year ended december   we used million of cash 
we expect to continue to fund our operations and satisfy our contractual obligations for primarily through our cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash generated by operations during the latter half of however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to generate positive operating cash flow during the latter half of or beyond 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  including cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and our ability to repatriate cash from our foreign locations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months from the date of this report 
however  our cash requirements for that month period may be greater than we anticipate due to  among other reasons  lower than expected cash generated from operating activities including the impact of foreign currency rate changes  revenues that are lower than we currently anticipate  greater than expected operating expenses  usage of cash to fund our foreign operations  unanticipated limitations or timing restrictions on our ability to access funds that are held in our non us subsidiaries  a deterioration of the quality of our accounts receivable  which could lower the borrowing base under our credit facility  and any failure on our part to remain in compliance with the covenants under our revolving credit facility 
our expectations regarding cash sufficiency assume that our revenues will be sufficient to enable us to comply with our credit facility ebidta covenant discussed below 
if our revenues are lower than we anticipate  we will be required to reduce our operating expenses to remain in compliance with this financial covenant 
however  reducing our operating expenses will be very challenging for us  since we undertook restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of that reduced our operating expenses significantly from second quarter levels 
should we be required to further reduce operating expenses  it could have the effect of reducing our revenues 
our cash needs include our requirement to repay million under the mig notes  million of which is payable in and million of which is payable in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this report for more information regarding our debt our anticipated cash requirements during also include payments for prepaid royalties and guarantees  of which approximately a 
table of contents portion is related to new license agreements for which there is no existing contractual commitment  which amount we may elect to reduce if we require more working capital than we currently anticipate 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this report for more information regarding our contractual commitments 
however  this reduced spending on new licenses and any additional reduction in spending may adversely impact our title plan for and beyond  and accordingly our ability to generate revenues in future periods 
conversely  if cash available to us is greater than we currently anticipate  we may elect to increase prepaid royalties above currently anticipated levels if we believe it will contribute to enhanced revenue growth and profitability 
we currently have an million credit facility with a lender  which expires in december our credit facility contains financial covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to draw down the entire million 
these covenants are as follows earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
we must maintain  measured on consolidated basis as of the end of each of the following periods  ebitda of at least the following october  through december  october  through march  january  through june  april  through september  july  through december  october  through march  january  through june  april  through september  july  through december  for purposes of the above covenant  ebitda means a our consolidated net income  determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  plus b interest expense  plus c to the extent deducted in the calculation of net income  depreciation expense and amortization expense  plus d income tax expense  plus e non cash stock compensation expense  plus f non cash goodwill and other intangible assets and royalty impairments  plus h non cash foreign exchange translation charges  minus i all of our non cash income and the non cash income of our subsidiaries for such period 
minimum domestic liquidity we must maintain at the lender an amount of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of not less than the greater of a of our total consolidated unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  or b of outstanding obligations under the credit facility 
our credit facility is collateralized on eligible customer accounts receivable balances  as defined by the lender 
there can be no assurances that our eligible accounts receivable balances will be adequate to allow us to draw down on the entire million credit facility 
in addition  among other things  the credit facility limits our ability to dispose of certain assets  make acquisitions  incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  pay dividends and make other distributions  and make investments 
further  the credit facility requires us to maintain a separate account with the lender for collection of our accounts receivables 
all deposits into this account will be automatically applied by the lender to our outstanding obligations under the credit facility 
as of february   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our credit facility 
our failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants in the credit facility would not only prohibit us from borrowing under the facility  but would also constitute a default  permitting the lender to  among other things  declare any outstanding borrowings  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  immediately due and payable 
a change in control of glu also constitutes an event of default  permitting the lender to accelerate the indebtedness and terminate the credit facility 
the credit facility also contains other customary events of default 
utilizing our credit facility results in debt payments that bear interest at the lender s prime rate plus  but no loess than  which adversely impact our cash position and result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this report for more information regarding our credit facility 

table of contents the credit facility matures on december   when all amounts outstanding will be due 
if the credit facility is terminated prior to maturity by us or by the lender after the occurrence and continuance of an event of default  then we will owe a termination fee equal to  or of the total commitment 
as of december   we were in compliance with the ebitda covenants and received a waiver for non compliance on the minimum domestic liquidity and certain financial reporting requirements 
as of this report  we believe that we will continue to meet the future ebitda covenant requirements 
of the million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments that we held at december   approximately million are held in accounts in china 
to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations  we intend to repatriate a range of approximately to million of available funds from china to the u 
s no later than june   which would subject us to withholding taxes of at least on any repatriated funds and potential additional tax  including cash tax payments 
given the current global economic environment and other potential developments outside of our control  we may be unable to utilize the funds that we hold in all of our non us accounts  which funds include cash and marketable securities  since the funds may be frozen by international regulatory action  the accounts may become illiquid for an indeterminate period of time or there may be other such circumstances that we are unable to predict 
in addition  we may require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue  and to defend against  settle or pay damages related to a pre litigation dispute to which we are currently a party 
we also intend to enter into new licensing arrangements for existing or new licensed intellectual properties  which may require us to make royalty payments at the outset of the agreements well before we are able to collect cash payments and or recognize revenue associated with the licensed intellectual properties 
if our cash sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  we may be required to sell convertible debt or equity securities to raise additional capital or to increase the amount available to us for borrowing under our credit facility 
we may be unable to raise additional capital through the sale of securities  or to do so on terms that are favorable to us  particularly given current capital market and overall economic conditions 
any sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
additionally  we may be unable to increase the size of our credit facility  or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us  particularly in light of the current credit market conditions 
if the amount of cash that we generate from operations is less than anticipated  we could also be required to extend the term beyond its december expiration date or replace it with an alternate loan arrangement  and resulting debt payments thereunder could further inhibit our ability to achieve profitability in the future 
contractual obligations the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter in thousands operating lease obligations  net of sublease income guaranteed royalties mig earnout and bonus notes fin obligations  including interest and penalties we have entered into license and development arrangements with various owners of brands and other intellectual property so that we can create and publish games for mobile handsets based on that intellectual property 
pursuant to some of these agreements  we are required to pay guaranteed royalties over the term of the contracts regardless of actual game sales 
certain of these minimum payments totaling million have been recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet because payment is not contingent upon performance by the licensor 

table of contents we have issued million of notes payable to former shareholders of mig 
one of the former officers of mig must continue to provide services through june  to be fully vested in the special bonus  and as a result  we did not record  of the special bonus that is subject to vesting 
as of december   unrecognized tax benefits and potential interest and penalties are classified within other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the settlement of our income tax liabilities cannot be determined  however  the liabilities are not expected to become due within the next twelve months

recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fsp fas  determination of useful life of intangible assets fsp fas 
fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp fas also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier adoption is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of fas fsp will have on our financial statements 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
in february  the fasb issued a staff position  fsp no 
 that delays the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and liabilities except for those recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to our financial assets and liabilities only 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of applying sfas to our non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of sfas requires additional disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value see note  it did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
we did not elect to adopt the fair value option under sfas as this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and establishes principles and requirements for how the 
table of contents acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption of sfas r is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of adopting sfas r on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas which amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements arb  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity separate and apart from the parent s equity in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the amendments to arb  this statement amends fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  so that earnings per share data will continue to be calculated the same way those data were calculated before this statement was issued 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of adopting sfas on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our interest payable under our million credit facility and potential increases in our interest payments arising from increases in interest rates and our investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect interest payments under our million revolving credit facility 
advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to our credit facility lender s prime rate  plus  but no less than 
consequently  our interest expense will fluctuate with changes in the general level of interest rates 
at february   we had million outstanding under the credit facility and our effective interest rate at that time was approximately 
we believe that a change in the lender s prime rate would have a significant impact on our interest expense  results of operations and liquidity 
we are also potentially exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect interest earned on our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had no short term investments  as substantially all million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in operating bank accounts earning nominal interest 
accordingly  we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results or liquidity 
in addition  during and we held auction rate securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources investing activities  in item of this report  and risk factors in item a of this report for a description of market events that affected the liquidity and fair value of these securities 
as of december   we held no auction rate securities 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are  in order of importance  to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not currently use or plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as of december  and  our cash and cash equivalents were maintained by financial institutions in the united states  the united kingdom  brazil  chile  china  france  germany  hong kong  italy  russia and spain and our current deposits are likely in excess of insured limits 
our accounts receivable primarily relate to revenues earned from domestic and international wireless carriers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our carriers financial condition but generally require no collateral from them 
as of december  and  verizon wireless accounted for and of our total accounts receivable  respectively  and no other carrier represented more than of our total accounts receivable 

table of contents foreign currency risk the functional currencies of our united states and united kingdom operations are the united states dollar  or usd  and the pound sterling  or gbp  respectively  and the functional currency of our china operations is the chinese renminbi 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the usd or gbp 
our revenues are usually denominated in the functional currency of the carrier 
operating expenses are usually in the local currency of the operating unit  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to currency fluctuations 
intercompany transactions between our domestic and foreign operations are denominated in either the usd or gbp 
at month end  foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and intercompany balances are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in other income expense  net 
we transact business in countries in approximately different currencies and in some of these currencies fluctuated by up to 
our foreign currency exchange gains and losses have been generated primarily from fluctuations in gbp versus the usd and in the euro versus gbp 
we have in the past  and in the future may experience foreign currency exchange losses on our accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables 
foreign currency exchange losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there is also additional risk if the currency is not freely or actively traded 
some currencies  such as the chinese renminbi  in which our chinese operations principally transact business  are subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies  which can limit out ability to react to foreign currency devaluations 
to date  we have not engaged in exchange rate hedging activities and we do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we might not be able to offset these higher costs fully through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition
