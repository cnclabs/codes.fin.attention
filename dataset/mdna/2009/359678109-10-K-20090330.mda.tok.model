table of contents critical accounting estimates and policies although our financial statements necessarily make use of certain accounting estimates by management  we believe that  except as discussed below  no matters that are the subject of such estimates are so highly uncertain or susceptible to change as to present a significant risk of a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance 
the significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements primarily include management s fair value estimates related to notes receivable from tribal governments  and the related evaluation of the recoverability of our investments in contract rights 
various assumptions  principally affecting the timing and  to a lesser extent  the probability of completing our various projects under development and getting them open for business  and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact and project specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and current and expected legal  regulatory and economic conditions 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas  if any  where changes in such estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
where recoverability of these assets or planned investments are contingent upon the successful development and management of a project  we evaluate the likelihood that the project will be completed  the prospective market dynamics and how the proposed facilities should compete in that setting in order to forecast future cash flows necessary to recover the recorded value of the assets or planned investment 
in most cases  we engage independent valuation consultants to assist management in preparing and periodically updating market and or feasibility studies for use in the preparation of forecasted cash flows 
we review our conclusions as warranted by changing conditions 
long term assets related to indian casino projects we account for the advances made to tribes as in substance structured notes at estimated fair value in accordance with the guidance contained in emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of interest income and balance sheet classification of structure notes 
because our right to recover our advances and development costs with respect to indian gaming projects is limited to  and contingent upon  the future net revenues of the proposed gaming facilities  we evaluate the financial opportunity of each potential service arrangement before entering into an agreement to provide financial support for the development of an indian project 
this process includes determining the financial feasibility of the project assuming the project is built  assessing the likelihood that the project will receive the necessary regulatory approvals and funding for construction and operations to commence  and estimating the expected timing of the various elements of the project including commencement of operations 
when we enter into a service or lending arrangement  management has concluded  based on feasibility analyses and legal reviews  that there is a high probability that the project will be completed and that the probable future economic benefit is sufficient to compensate us for our efforts in relation to the perceived financial risks 
in arriving at our initial conclusion of probability  we consider both positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence ordinarily consists not only of project specific advancement or progress  but the advancement of similar projects in the same and other jurisdictions  while negative evidence ordinarily consists primarily of unexpected  unfavorable legal  regulatory or political developments such as adverse actions by legislators  regulators or courts 
such positive and negative evidence is reconsidered at least quarterly 
no asset  including notes receivable or contract rights  related to an indian casino project is recorded on our books unless it is considered probable that the project will be built and will result in an economic benefit sufficient for us to recover the asset 
in initially determining the financial feasibility of the project  we analyze the proposed facilities and their location in relation to market conditions  including customer demographics and existing and proposed competition for the project 
typically  independent consultants are also hired to prepare market and financial feasibility reports 
these reports are reviewed by management and updated periodically as conditions change 

table of contents in assessing the probability of completing the project  we also consider the status of the regulatory approval process including whether the federal bureau of indian affairs  or bia  recognizes the tribe  the tribe has the right to acquire land to be used as a casino site  the department of the interior has put the land into trust as a casino site  the tribe has a gaming compact with the state government  the nigc has approved a proposed management agreement  and other legal or political obstacles exist or are likely to occur 
the development phase of each relationship commences with the signing of the respective agreements and continues until the casino is open for business 
thereafter  the management phase of the relationship  governed by the management contract  typically continues for a period of between five to seven years 
we make advances to the tribes  recorded as notes receivable  primarily to fund certain portions of the projects  which bear no interest or below market interest until operations commence 
repayment of the notes receivable and accrued interest is only required if the casino is successfully opened and distributable profits are available from the casino operations 
under the management agreement  we typically earn a management fee calculated as a percentage of the net income of the gaming facility 
in addition  repayment of the loans and our management fees are subordinated to certain other financial obligations of the respective operations 
generally  the order of priority of payments from the casinos cash flows is as follows a certain minimum monthly priority payment to the tribe  repayment of various senior debt associated with construction and equipping of the casino with interest accrued thereon  repayment of various debt with interest accrued thereon due to us  management fee to us  other obligations  and the remaining funds distributed to the tribe 
notes receivable we account for and present our notes receivable from and management agreements with the tribes as separate assets 
under the contractual terms  the notes do not become due and payable unless and until the projects are completed and operational 
however  if our development activity is terminated prior to completion  we generally would retain the right to collect on our notes receivable in the event a casino project is completed by another developer 
because we ordinarily do not consider the stated rate of interest on the notes receivable to be commensurate with the risk inherent in these projects prior to commencement of operations  the estimated fair value of the notes receivable is generally less than the amount advanced 
at the date of each advance  the difference between the estimated fair value of the note receivable and the actual amount advanced is recorded as either an intangible asset contract rights or if the rights were acquired in a separate  unbundled transaction  expensed as period costs of retaining such rights 
subsequent to its effective initial recording at estimated fair value  the note receivable portion of the advance is adjusted to its current estimated fair value at each balance sheet date  using level inputs  which are defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 as unobservable inputs that reflect management s estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
financial accounting standards board staff position fas  determining the fair value of financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  fsp fas was issued in october and was retroactively effective for the quarter ended september  the implementation of fsp fas did not have a material impact on the company s valuation techniques  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not adjust notes receivable to an estimated fair value that exceeds the face value of the note plus accrued interest  if any 
due to the uncertainties surrounding the projects  no interest income is recognized in the consolidated financial statements during the development period  but changes in estimated fair value of the notes receivable are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in our statement of operations 

table of contents upon opening of the casino  the difference  if any  between the then recorded estimated fair value of the notes receivable  subject to any appropriate impairment adjustments made pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and the amount contractually due under the notes would be amortized into income using the effective interest method over the remaining term of the note 
contract rights contract rights are recognized as intangible assets related to the acquisition of the management agreements and periodically evaluated for impairment based on the estimated cash flows from the management contract on an undiscounted basis and amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of seven years or contractual lives of the agreements  typically beginning upon commencement of casino operations 
in the event the carrying value of the intangible assets were to exceed the undiscounted cash flow  the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets would be charged to operations 
the cash flow estimates for each project were developed based upon published and other information gathered pertaining to the applicable markets 
we have many years of experience in making these estimates and also utilize independent appraisers and feasibility consultants to assist management in developing our estimates 
the cash flow estimates are initially prepared and periodically updated primarily for business planning purposes with the tribes and are secondarily used in connection with our impairment analysis of the carrying value of contract rights  land held for development  and other capitalized costs  if any  associated with our tribal casino projects 
the primary assumptions used in estimating the undiscounted cash flow from the projects include the expected number of class iii gaming devices  table games  and poker tables  and the related estimated win per unit per day wpud 
generally  within reasonably possible operating ranges  our impairment decisions are not particularly sensitive to changes in these assumptions because estimated cash flows greatly exceed the carrying value of the related intangibles and other capitalized costs 
we believe that the primary competitors to our michigan project are the four winds casino in southwestern michigan  five northern indiana riverboats and three downtown detroit casinos  whose published wpud has consistently averaged above the used in our undiscounted cash flow analysis 
in addition  our market analysis assumes the development of another native american casino of approximately equal size by the gun lake tribe approximately miles to the northwest of our facility sometime in late or our michigan project is located approximately miles west of detroit and approximately driving miles northeast of four winds casino  which opened in august near new buffalo  michigan 
summary of long term assets related to indian casino projects at december  and  long term assets associated with tribal casino projects are summarized as follows  with notes receivable presented at their estimated fair value fire keepers notes receivable  tribal governments contract rights  net other projects notes receivable  tribal governments contract rights  net 
table of contents as previously noted  the firekeepers project comprises the majority of long term assets related to tribal casino projects 
we have an approved management agreement with the authority for the development and operation of the firekeepers casino  which provides that we will receive  only from the operations and financing of the project  reimbursement for all advances we have made to the authority and a management fee equal to of the net revenues of the casino defined effectively as net income prior to management fees for a period of seven years commencing upon opening 
the terms of an amended management agreement were approved by the nigc in april in may  in connection with the project financing  million of the notes receivable was repaid  which resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the notes receivable of approximately million  which was recorded as an unrealized gain in the first quarter of the remaining million of the note receivable is expected to be repaid days following opening of the casino  provided there are sufficient funds remaining in the construction disbursement account 
if there are insufficient funds remaining in the construction disbursement account  the balance becomes payable in equal monthly installments beginning days after the commencement of operations of the casino  plus interest at prime plus 
we are monitoring the progress of the project and the development budget and believe that sufficient funds will be left to fund the million reimbursement following opening 
in arriving at the estimated opening date for the firekeepers project  which we believe will be in the third quarter of  we considered the status of the following conditions and estimated the time necessary to complete the construction the tribe is federally recognized  adequate land for the proposed casino resort has been placed in trust  the tribe has a valid gaming compact with the state of michigan  the nigc approved the management agreement  the bia issued a record of decision approving the final environmental impact statement in september  project financing was obtained in may  construction commenced  with an anticipated construction period of approximately months  and construction to date has progressed on schedule 
the company extended its estimated opening date for the montana casino from the second quarter of to the third quarter of the company had expected that the tribe would receive key federal and state approvals during the fourth quarter of which were not received and the pending change in the federal administration is expected to further delay the approval process until the second quarter of next year 
the effect of the change in the estimated opening date reduced the estimated fair value of the note receivable related to the montana project by  as of december  on march   we announced that we are no longer pursuing the namb project 
as of december   we have advanced million for the development of the project  all of which is expected to be reimbursed by the namb tribe from the revenues of their expected gaming project 
in addition  the company expects to negotiate payment from the namb tribe or its new developer for the value of the exclusive gaming rights granted to the company by the namb tribe 
however  in december   the company recorded an impairment loss associated with the related contract rights of million  pending a resolution with the namb tribe 
the estimated fair value of the receivable from the namb project is now based on the assumption that the namb tribe will develop a smaller scope project and will repay the advances over a five year period after the project opens with interest at prime plus 
however  the collectability ultimately depends on the successful development and operation of the project  which we have no influence over  and accordingly  we have discounted the payment stream using a discount rate 
the development agreement between the company and the namb tribe provides that the company is entitled to recoup its advances from future gaming development  even if the company does not ultimately develop the project 
the namb tribe has confirmed in writing that it is obligated to repay the reimbursable advances 
in addition  the namb tribe has informed management that it intends to develop a small gaming facility with another developer 
accordingly  management believes that the namb tribe has the intent and will likely have the ability to repay the advances  either using a portion of the project financing or future cash flows of the project once open 
due to the absence of observable market quotes on our notes receivable from tribal governments  management develops inputs based on the best information available  including internally developed data  such as estimates of future interest rates  discount rates and casino opening dates as discussed below 
the estimated fair value of our notes receivable related to tribal casino projects make up approximately of our total assets  and are the only assets in our financial statements that are reported at estimated fair value 
changes in the estimated fair value of our notes receivable are reported as unrealized gains losses  which affect reported net income  but do not affect cash flows 

table of contents the following table reflects selected key assumptions and information used to estimate the fair value of the notes receivable for all projects at december  and aggregate face amount of the notes receivable including interest estimated years until opening of casino firekeepers montana discount rate firekeepers montana estimated probability of the casino opening as expected firekeepers montana for the portion of the notes not repaid prior to the commencement of operations  management estimates that the stated interest rates during the loan repayment terms will be commensurate with the inherent risk at that time 
the estimated probability rates have been re evaluated and modified accordingly  based on project specific risks such as delays of regulatory approvals for the projects and review of the financing environment 
the estimated casino opening dates used in the valuations take into account project specific circumstances such as ongoing litigation  the status of required regulatory approvals  construction periods and other factors 
factors that we consider in arriving at a discount rate include discount rates typically used by gaming industry investors and appraisers to value individual casino properties outside of nevada and discount rates produced by the widely accepted capital asset pricing model  or capm  using the following key assumptions s p  and year average benchmark investment returns medium term horizon risk premiums  risk free investment return equal to the trailing year average for day treasury bills  investment beta factor equal to the unlevered five year average for the hotel gaming industry  and project specific adjustments based on typical size premiums for micro cap and low cap companies using and year averages  and the status of outstanding required regulatory approvals and or litigation  if any 
management believes that under the circumstances  essentially three critical dates and events that impact the project specific discount rate adjustment when using capm are the date that management completes its feasibility assessment and decides to invest in the opportunity  the date that construction financing has been obtained after all legal obstacles have been removed  and the date that operations commence 

table of contents at december  and  the sensitivity of changes in the key assumptions discussed in greater detail below related to the firekeepers project are illustrated by the following hypothetical increases decreases in the estimated fair value of the note receivable discount rate increases discount rate decreases forecasted opening date delayed one quarter forecasted opening date accelerated one quarter amortization of gaming and contract rights is  or is expected to be provided on a straight line basis over the contractual lives of the assets 
the contractual lives may include  or not begin until after a development period and or the term of the subsequent management agreement 
because the development period may vary based on evolving events  the estimated contractual lives may require revision in future periods 
accordingly  we extended the amortization period in to reflect the revised anticipated opening date for the michigan casino 
these gaming and contract rights are held by us and are to be assigned to the appropriate operating subsidiary when the related project is operational and  therefore  they are not included in the calculation of the non controlling interest in the subsidiaries 
advances to tribes are expected to be repaid prior to commencement of operations  or within the repayment term of typically between five and seven years  commencing to days after the opening of the project 
as of december   we estimate the following potential exposure resulting from a project not reaching completion december  firekeepers new mexico montana total notes receivable contract rights amortization of contract rights is expected to be provided on a straight line basis over the contractual lives of the assets 
the contractual lives may include  or not begin until after a development period and or the term of the subsequent management agreement 
because the development period may vary based on evolving events  the estimated contractual lives may require revision in future periods 
the contract rights are owned solely by us and are expected to be assigned to the appropriate operating subsidiary when the related project is operational and  therefore  the contract rights are not currently included in the balance of non controlling interests 
due to our current financing arrangement for the development of the michigan project through a owned joint venture  we believe we are exposed to the majority of risk of economic loss from the joint venture s activities 
therefore  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  we consider the joint venture to be a variable interest entity that requires consolidation in our financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
although sfas no 
is effective now and has been adopted as amended by fasb staff position fsp fas  determining the fair value of financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  issued in october  for financial assets and liabilities carried at estimated fair value  it will become effective in for any nonfinancial assets and liabilities so carried  but we have none 
therefore  no future effect of the non financial provisions of sfas no 
on our future financial position  results of operations or cash flows is expected 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas no 
is effective for us for  and early adoption is prohibited 
among the effects of sfas no 
will be the future exclusion from net income loss of the non controlling interest therein and the relocation of such non controlling interest to the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  that sfas no 
will have on our future financial position  results of operations and operating cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
sfas no 
r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations for which the acquisition date is in or thereafter 
we are currently evaluating how sfas r will impact our financial statements should we enter into any business combination transactions after however  we currently have no announced or pending business combination transactions 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues from continuing operations 
for the year ended december   total operating revenues from continuing operations increased by million principally due to the fact that stockman s casino was acquired on january  resulting in eleven months of operations in and twelve months of operations in the increase in casino and food and beverage revenues of million was offset by a decrease of million in other operating income principally due to the recognition in the second quarter of  of one time revenues of million related to the termination of a consulting agreement with the hard rock casino in biloxi 
operating costs and expenses from continuing operations 
for the year ended december   total operating costs and expenses decreased million compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of decreases in project development costs and selling  general and administrative expenses as discussed below  offset by an increase in casino and food and beverage expenses of million  due to the fact that stockman s  which was acquired on january   and was operated by the company for only eleven months in the prior year 
project development costs 
project development costs decreased by million or due to reductions in new business development activity and reduced expenses for the tribal projects related to the discontinuance of the namb project  reduced activity in the northern cheyenne project and as a result of the michigan tribe obtaining project financing  which enabled the michigan tribe to fund the majority of its project costs beginning in the second quarter of selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or as compared to  primarily due to decreases at the corporate level in employee related expenses related to the reduction of stock based compensation and offset by increases related to the stockman acquisition as noted above 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased by million from the prior year primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment of million during and one more month of depreciation in when compared to operating gains losses 
for the year ended december   operating gains increased by million or 
the increase is primarily due to the net impact of the change in the discount rates and the estimated opening dates of the tribal projects which resulted in an increase in unrealized gains of million or from the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to the michigan project  which is scheduled to open in the third quarter of the increase also included an increase in our share of income from the delaware joint venture of million or over the prior year due  in part  to our restructured management contract with hri 
other income expense 
for the year ended december   other expenses increased by  as compared to  principally due to the decrease of interest and other income of million  offset by a decrease of interest expense of million and increase of million in non controlling interest in net income of consolidated joint venture 
the decrease of interest and other income is due to the absence in of non recurring revenues of  recorded in the third quarter of  related to the transfer of an obligation to pay an architectural firm related to the michigan project 
originally  the company had guaranteed the tribe s obligation to pay the architectural firm 
however  as part of the revised management agreement negotiated during the third quarter of  the obligation was transferred to the michigan tribe without recourse to the company and  therefore  the liability was eliminated  as provided in sfas no 
the decrease of interest expense is due to the reduction in interest expense related to the reduction of outstanding debt on the company s revolving line of credit 

table of contents income taxes 
for the year ended december   the effective income tax rate was approximately  compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to income tax permanent differences related to restricted stock grants vested in liquidity and capital resources the delaware joint venture and stockman s casino operation are currently our primary sources of recurring income and positive cash flow 
distributions from the delaware operation are governed by the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement and management reorganization agreement 
we expect to continue receiving management fees as currently prescribed under the management agreement  with a minimum guaranteed growth factor over the prior year of in years through august on a consolidated basis  for the fiscal year ended december   cash provided by operations decreased million due in part to the sale of the hotel in february and higher gem expenses 
cash provided by investing activities increased million from the prior year primarily due to cash proceeds generated from the sale of the holiday inn express in february of million and the repayment of tribal advances related to the firekeepers project of million in may  partially offset by million in cash used to acquire additional michigan contract rights in the second quarter 
in the prior year period  the primary use of cash for investing activities related to the acquisition of stockman s casino 
cash used in financing activities increased million primarily due to repayment of long term debt using the net proceeds received from investing activities 
as of december   the company had approximately million in cash and availability on its revolving credit facility of million 
the united states is currently experiencing a recession accompanied by  among other things  instability in the investment and commercial banking systems  reduced credit availability and highly curtailed gaming and other recreational activities  and it is also engaged in war 
the effects and duration of these developments and related risks and uncertainties on the company s future operations and cash flows cannot be estimated at this time but may be significant 
our future cash requirements will include funding the remaining near and long term cash requirements of our development expenses for the michigan and montana projects  selling  general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures primarily at stockman s and debt service 
subject to the economic uncertainties discussed in the previous paragraph  we believe that adequate financial resources will be available to execute our current growth plan from a combination of operating cash flows and external debt and equity financing 
however  continued downward pressure on cash receipts due to  among other reasons  the adverse effects of the current economic environment and or the lack of available funding sources due to  among other reasons  the recent unprecedented global contraction in available credit increases uncertainty with respect to our development and growth plans 
again  subject to the foregoing uncertainty about credit availability and a significant national downward trend in casino gaming activity due to recent economic developments  we believe that our casino development projects currently in progress will likely be constructed and ultimately  will achieve profitable operations  however  no assurance can be made that this will occur or how long it will take 
if our casino development projects currently in progress are not completed  or upon completion  if we fail to successfully compete within a reasonable timeframe in the highly competitive and currently declining market for gaming activities  we may lack the funds to compete for and develop future gaming or other business opportunities 
long term debt includes a reducing revolving loan from nevada state bank 
the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding under the reducing revolving loan decreases million semiannually on january and july  and any outstanding amounts above such reduced maximum must be repaid on each such date 
the reducing revolving loan is payable over years at a variable interest rate based on the five year libor swap rate plus 
this rate  which was per annum as of december  and december   adjusts annually based on the funded debt to ebitda ratio of stockman s  with adjustments based on the five year libor swap rate occurring every five years 
with the sale of the holiday inn express in february  the balance on the loan was reduced from million to million  and the company s availability under the facility increased to approximately million 
in addition  periodic payment requirements were reduced on a pro rata basis 
on october   the company paid additional principal of million and the line of credit availability as of december  was million 
in march   the company made million of voluntary principal payments on its revolving credit line  increasing the availability under the line to million and reducing its cash balance to million 
the remaining balance of million is not due until january of 
table of contents the loan agreement with nevada state bank also contains customary financial representations and warranties and requires that stockman s maintain specified financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio  a funded debt to ebitda ratio and a minimum tangible net worth 
in addition  the loan agreement limits the amount of distributions from and capital expenditures by stockman s 
the loan agreement also provides for customary events of default including payment defaults and covenant defaults 
the promissory note payable to the seller of stockman s bears interest at per annum  is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest and is secured by a second interest in the real estate of stockman s 
on july   the company announced a stock repurchase plan the repurchase plan 
under the repurchase plan  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time  in compliance with rule b of the securities and exchange act of  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
on october   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of the company s common stock  and extended the expiration of the repurchase plan to april  through december   the company had repurchased  shares at a weighted average price per share of  costing million  including commissions and other related transaction costs 
the repurchase plan does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended at any time at management s discretion 
as of december   the company held million in a u 
s 
government money market account  included in total cash of million 
on september  the us treasury announced a temporary guarantee program for us registered money market funds 
under this new treasury department program  investments in a money market fund as of september   will be temporarily insured to enable shareholders to receive a net asset value of per share if the fund is liquidated 
the program is designed to address current market conditions and will initially exist only for a three month period 
the treasury department can extend the program for up to an additional nine months  as needed 
we believe it is unlikely that the insurance will be necessary for our us government money market fund  as investments in the fund continue to adhere to strict credit quality  liquidity and diversification guidelines 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of stockman s for million  which included million of capitalized costs  plus million for the right to adjust the tax basis of the assets acquired 
stockman s owns and operates stockman s casino and  until february   the holiday inn express in fallon  nevada 
the transaction was financed with a portion of the net proceeds from our december stock offering  cash on hand  million of debt secured by the capital stock and assets of stockman s and a million promissory note to the seller of stockman s 
effective may   gem entered into an agreement with green acres whereby gem acquired all of green acres interests in the nottawaseppi huron band of potawatomi casino project in michigan for million 
gem s members equally funded an initial deposit and periodic payments of approximately million 
the remaining obligation of million  although unsecured  was recorded as a long term liability once the management agreement between gem and the authority was approved in december on may   in conjunction with the financing of the firekeepers casino  the company applied the proceeds of the million tribal receivable reimbursement to pay off the remaining balance of the million green acres liability 
in december  ram exercised its conversion option on its million loan to the company 
as a result  million of the loan was converted to a capital contribution to the michigan joint venture  and the loan balance of million  plus million of accrued interest on the original loan  became a liability of gem 

table of contents additional projects are considered based on their forecasted profitability  development period  regulatory and political environment and the ability to secure the funding necessary to complete the development  among other considerations 
as part of our agreements for tribal developments  we typically fund costs associated with projects which may include legal  civil engineering  environmental  design  training  land acquisition and other related advances while assisting the tribes in securing financing for the construction of the project 
the majority of these costs are advanced to the tribes and are reimbursable to us  pursuant to management and development agreements  as part of the financing of the project s development 
while each project is unique  we forecast these costs when determining the feasibility of each opportunity 
such agreements to finance costs associated with the development and furtherance of projects are typical in this industry and have become expected of tribal gaming developers 
indian casino projects because we have received proposals from several funding sources for our indian casino projects  we expect to successfully arrange on behalf of the tribe third party funding for the construction stage of our indian casino projects 
however  if none of these proposals result in funding on acceptable terms  we believe that we could either sell our rights to one or more projects and land held  find a partner with funding  or abandon the project and have our receivables reimbursed from future tribal gaming operations  if any  developed by another party 
presently  we do not generate sufficient internal cash flow to fund the construction phase of our indian casino projects 
if we were to discontinue development activities related to any or all of these projects  the related receivables and intangibles would then be evaluated for impairment 
the december balance of notes receivable from indian advances was approximately million below the contractual value of the notes including accrued interest and the related contract rights are valued below the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the management fees of the projects 
therefore  although the actual amount cannot be estimated at this time  we currently do not believe that the carrying value of our long term assets related to tribal casinos has been impaired 
our funding of the michigan project and our liquidity are affected by an agreement with ram  the non controlling  owner of our michigan joint venture 
in february  in exchange for funding a portion of the development costs  ram advanced us million which was partially convertible into a capital contribution to the michigan joint venture upon federal approval of the land into trust application and federal approval of the management agreement with the michigan tribe  both of which had occurred as of december  accordingly  in december  ram exercised its conversion option and million of the original loan was converted into a capital contribution to the michigan joint venture  with the remaining loan balance of million  plus million of accrued interest becoming debt repayable solely from the michigan joint venture 
on may   the authority closed on the sale of million of senior secured notes and a million equipment financing facility to fund the development and construction of the tribe s firekeepers casino in michigan 
on the same date  gem received a payment of approximately million on its notes receivable from the authority  with the remaining million to be paid days following the opening of the casino  subject to there being adequate funds remaining in the construction disbursement account 
if there are insufficient funds to repay the remaining balance  the authority will be obligated to repay the balance in monthly installments beginning days following the opening of the casino  plus interest at prime plus 
on the same day  gem funded million in financing costs on behalf of the authority  as required by the management agreement  which was recorded as additional gaming rights related to the michigan project 
the company and ram each contributed one half of the funds to gem for gem to make this funding 
our michigan joint venture has the exclusive right to arrange the financing and provide casino management services to the michigan tribe in exchange for a management fee of of net revenues defined effectively as net income before management fees for seven years 
the terms of our management agreement were approved by the nigc in december and an amended contract as approved in april no assurance can be given that the management fee paid by firekeepers will have a significant impact on the company s cash flow from operations 

table of contents in may  we entered into development and management agreements with the northern cheyenne tribe of montana for a proposed casino to be built approximately miles north of sheridan  wyoming 
the northern cheyenne tribe currently operates the charging horse casino in lame deer  montana  consisting of gaming devices  a seat bingo hall and restaurant 
as part of the agreements  we have committed on a best efforts basis to arrange financing for the costs associated with the development and furtherance of this project up to million 
our agreements with the tribe provide for the reimbursement of these advances either from the proceeds of the financing of the development  the actual operation itself or  in the event that we do not complete the development  from the revenues of the tribal gaming operation undertaken by others 
the management agreement and related contracts have been submitted to the nigc for approval  but will be revised as necessary based on the final agreed upon size and scope of the project with the tribe 
presently  we are not obligated to fund the construction phase of our northern cheyenne project in montana 
the firekeepers casino development financing has been secured by the tribe 
the recent unprecedented global contraction in available credit significantly decreases the likelihood that financing could be obtained on favorable terms if at all for the montana project this year 
we believe that credit markets will improve sufficiently in order for the montana tribe to fund the project when we are expected to commence construction later next year 
however  if the montana tribe is unable to obtain funding on acceptable terms  we believe we could either sell our rights to the montana project  find a partner with funding  or abandon the montana project and have our receivables reimbursed from the gaming operations  if any  developed by another party 
however  if we were to discontinue the montana project  the related receivables and intangibles would then be evaluated for impairment 
in  we signed gaming development and management agreements with the namb tribe of new mexico to develop a  square foot facility including gaming  restaurants  entertainment and other amenities as part of the tribe s multi phased master plan of economic development 
in march  management announced that the company was no longer pursuing the namb project 
pursuant to the terms of the development agreement  the namb tribe has recognized the obligation to reimburse all of the company s development advances for the project 
full house currently has advanced million for the development of the project  all of which is expected to be reimbursed by the namb tribe 
in addition  management expects to negotiate payment from the namb tribe or its new developer for the value of the exclusive gaming rights granted to the company by the namb tribe 
the receivable from the namb tribe is valued based on the present value of a five year collection period and a discount rate 
the collectability ultimately depends on the quality and timing of the project development which we are monitoring  but have no influence over 
our agreements with the various indian tribes contain limited waivers of sovereign immunity and  in many cases  provide for arbitration to enforce the agreements 
generally  our only recourse for collection of funds under these agreements is from revenues  if any  of prospective casino operations 
other as part of the termination of our hard rock licensing rights in biloxi  mississippi  we agreed to provide consulting services to hard rock if and when the biloxi facility opens  entitling us to annually receive the greater of  or of licensing fees for the two year consulting period 
however  due to the devastation caused by hurricane katrina  which caused severe damage to the hard rock casino in biloxi  the opening of the facility  which was originally scheduled for the third quarter of  was postponed to the summer of full house received a one time cash payment of million in the second quarter of  related to the termination of a consulting agreement with the hard rock casino in biloxi  mississippi 
in  we declared a dividend of million equal to the amount of previously accrued and unpaid dividends  on the  outstanding shares of our series preferred stock  which was paid in january concurrent with payment of the dividends  the holders exercised their right to convert the preferred stock into common stock on a one for one basis and accordingly  as of december  and  there are no preferred shares issued or outstanding and no future dividend payments are currently contemplated 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from changes in market rates or prices  such as interest rates and commodity prices 
we are exposed to market risk in the form of changes in interest rates and the potential impact such changes may have on our variable rate debt 
we have not invested in derivative based financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
however  we have cash on deposit with financial institutions substantially in excess of federally insured limits  and the risk of losses related to such concentrations may be increasing as a result of economic developments 
of our total outstanding debt  including accrued interest  of approximately million at december   million is subject to variable interest rates  which averaged as of december  the applicable interest rates are based on the prime lending rate or the five year libor swap rate  and therefore  the interest rate will fluctuate as the index lending rates change 
based on our outstanding variable rate debt at december   a hypothetical basis point change in rates would result in an annual interest expense change of approximately  at this time  we do not anticipate that either inflation or interest rate variations will have a material impact on our future operations
