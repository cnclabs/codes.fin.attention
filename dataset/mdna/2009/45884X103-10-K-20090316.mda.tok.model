table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for additional overview information relating to our business  including actimmune  co promotion and our product development programs  please see the discussion in item business overview  which is incorporated herein by reference 
significant license acquisition agreements we are highly dependent on technology we license or acquire from third parties 
actimmune  which is currently our sole marketed product  is subject to a license agreement with genentech  inc the majority of our clinical development pipeline is also based on technology that we have licensed from third parties 
details of these agreements can be found elsewhere in this report under item business license and other agreements  notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and under the heading results of operations below 
we will be required to make contingent milestone payments in accordance with all of our license and acquisition agreements in the aggregate amount of million if all of the milestones defined in each of the agreements are achieved 
these milestones include development  regulatory approval  commercialization and sales milestones 
of the million in aggregate milestone payments  million in contingent payments would be made by us only if positive phase iii data and registration in the united states and european union are achieved for pirfenidone  of which million has been paid in march our need for additional capital we commenced operations in and have incurred significant losses to date 
our revenue has been limited primarily to sales of actimmune  which has been declining in recent years  derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over the next several years as we continue the development of our advanced stage pulmonology pipeline and our research stage hepatology pipeline  apply for regulatory approvals for pirfenidone and grow our operations 
although we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from sales of actimmune and the proceeds from our february public offering  described below  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  settlement with the government  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of  we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize pirfenidone 
as a result  we may require additional funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
if additional capital is not available  we may be forced to curtail our development activities or cease operations 
discontinuation of actimmune trial for ipf effective march   we made the decision to discontinue the phase iii inspire clinical trial evaluating actimmune in patients with ipf based upon the recommendation of the study s independent dmc 
as a result of the disappointing inspire trial results  we revised our estimates of inventory requirements as of december  accordingly  we recorded a charge of million in related to the prepayment of inventory that we had expected to receive in and while we believe other actimmune related assets are recoverable for at least their million net carrying value  if sales decline below our revised estimates  we may incur additional asset impairment charges  including inventory writedowns in excess of the million and million recorded in and  respectively  and impairment of acquired product rights  as well as product returns 

table of contents the following table reflects the asset balances as of december  which may be impacted in thousands finished goods inventory acquired product rights  net total critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation beginning january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to estimate the value of share based awards  we use the black scholes model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from any of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
if all of the remaining and outstanding restricted stock awards that were granted in  and became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
if all of the remaining nonvested and outstanding stock option awards that have been granted became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
however  no compensation expense will be recognized for any stock awards that do not vest 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and final delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collectibility of the amounts receivable from the customer 
therefore  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery when title passes to a credit worthy customer 
reserves are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns  rebates  
table of contents chargebacks and cash discounts  if applicable 
we sell to a limited number of customers  mainly specialty pharmacies and distributors 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
we are obligated to accept returns from customers if the pharmaceuticals they purchased have reached the expiration date 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on historical experience 
due to the nature of our business model and based on historical experience  these estimates are not highly subjective 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates  chargebacks and discounts each month and monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product expiration dates and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
for each of the periods presented below  we have not made any shipments as a result of incentives and or in excess of our customers ordinary course of business inventory levels 
specialty wholesalers maintain low inventory levels and manage their inventory levels to optimize patient based need demand and generally do not overstock actimmune 
the tables below present the amounts reported as revenue reductions for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentages year ended december  reductions to revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid rebates total year ended december  gross product revenue revenue reductions as a of gross product revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid rebates total in  chargebacks were approximately of gross revenue  but historically have fallen within a range of to in any given year depending on the customer base 
the increase in the current year is attributed to the tricare pharmacy program tricare which became effective january and is administered by the department of defense 
excluding tricare  chargebacks would have been approximately  which would have increased reported revenue by approximately million 
in  medicaid rebates were approximately of gross revenue  but could reasonably fall within a range of to in any given year 
if medicaid rebates had decreased to during  this would have increased our reported revenue by approximately million 
the ranges selected above are based on a review of historical trends and we believe they are reasonably likely to continue to be relevant in future periods 
chargebacks as a percentage of gross revenue increased in compared with and due to disappointing clinical trial results and our subsequent decision to discontinue further development of actimmune in addition to the new tricare program 
the increase in medicaid rebate revenue reserves from in and in to in is due to the price increase for actimmune implemented midway through and the lack of a corresponding increase in the medicaid reimbursement rate 

table of contents the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing chargebacks is from the federal supply schedule  veterans administration and public health system pricing documents 
these documents establish the maximum price allowable for the sale of our product to a government customer 
the chargeback amount per unit is computed as the difference between our sales price to the wholesaler and the selling price from the wholesaler to a government customer 
chargebacks are processed directly by the wholesalers and are deducted from payments to us 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing medicaid rebates is from each of the states 
medicaid rebates are billed directly to us from each state 
billings from each of the states  which are based on end user reports submitted by pharmacies to the state agencies  are typically received within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we use historical billing and payment trends made to the states to assist us in determining an estimated medicaid rebate amount each period 
clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may overestimate or underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in the event we underestimate  we could be required to record significant additional research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
to date  we have not experienced changes in estimates that have led to material research and development expense adjustments being recorded in future periods 
inventory reserves our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and our inventory costs are determined by the first in first out method 
we enter into purchase obligations to purchase our inventory based upon sales forecasts to enable us to mitigate some of the risk associated with the long lead times required to manufacture our products 
we write off the cost of inventory and reserve for future minimum purchase commitments  if any  that we consider to be in excess of forecasted future demand 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will expire before it can be sold  based on future sales forecasts 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory purchase levels 
we are also required to monitor the expiration dates of our products  since our products can no longer be used after their respective expiration dates 
in  in an effort to best manage the procurement and distribution of levels of actimmune  we successfully completed the necessary testing to extend the expiration period of actimmune from months to a total of months 
as part of our excess inventory assessment for actimmune  we also estimate the expiration date of any actimmune to be manufactured in the future 
projected revenue trends resulted in us recording charges during of million to cost of goods sold for excess inventories 
if actimmune revenue levels experienced in future periods are substantially below our current expectations  we could be required to record additional charges for excess inventories 
please refer to the statements under item a 
risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results could differ from our estimates 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   we recorded total net revenue of million  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of 
this decrease was attributable to a decrease in sales of actimmune of approximately million  or  partially offset by an increase in collaboration revenue of million resulting from the agreement with roche 
in early march  we announced that our phase iii inspire program for actimmune in ipf had been discontinued and that future actimmune revenue was expected to decline 
the million and million of collaboration revenue for and  respectively  includes million and million milestones received in september and june  respectively  each of which had been assessed as substantially at risk at the initiation of the agreement and were therefore recognized as revenue when the milestones were achieved  as defined in the collaboration agreement 
for each of the years ended december  and  actimmune accounted for all of our product revenue 
a substantial majority of these sales were derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
collaboration revenue in and also includes approximately million of amortization of the million upfront payments received from roche in and january there are a number of variables that impact actimmune revenue including  but not limited to  the discontinuation of the phase iii inspire clinical trial in march  the level of enrollment in ipf clinical trials of other companies  new patients started on therapy  average duration of therapy  new data on actimmune or other products presented at medical conferences and publications in medical journals  reimbursement and patient referrals from physicians 
in light of the failure of the inspire clinical trial  we expect that net sales of actimmune for the year ended december  will continue to decline 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold included product manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our product revenue and inventory writedowns 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of total product revenue  compared to million  or approximately of total product revenue  in the corresponding period of the decrease in cost of goods sold primarily reflects the decline in actimmune revenue 
included in cost of goods sold is a charge of million recorded for excess inventory 
included in cost of goods sold is a charge of approximately million for excess inventories  recorded in connection with the impact of the phase iii inspire trial results announced in march excluding the million and million charges for excess inventory and purchase commitments in and  respectively  cost of goods sold was approximately and of product revenue for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase can be attributed to a higher average cost per vial  reflecting a full year impact of the new supply agreement with bi entered into in june which stipulated a higher cost per vial charged to us 
exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases may affect cost of goods sold on actimmune inventory purchased from bi 
in the past  we have utilized forward exchange contracts to partially offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  but we did not enter into any new contracts in or research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to the discontinuation of the inspire program  offset by the full enrollment in and completion of our two phase iii capacity studies for pirfenidone late in and the conduct of the phase a and b studies of itmn the following table lists our current product development programs and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each program during the indicated periods 
the category titled 
table of contents programs non specific is comprised of facilities and personnel costs that are not allocated to a specific development program or discontinued programs and million and million of stock based compensation in and  respectively 
our management reviews each of these program categories in evaluating our business 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see the specific sections under item a 
risk factors above 
year ended december  development program in thousands pulmonology hepatology oncology programs non specific total the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investments in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  the submission of an ind with the fda to conduct human clinical trials for drugs  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and the submission by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of an nda or bla for a drug product to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in light of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
acquired research and development and milestone expense credits in  we licensed from marnac and its co licensor  kdl  their worldwide rights  excluding japan  korea and taiwan  to develop and commercialize pirfenidone for all fibrotic diseases  including renal  liver and pulmonary fibrosis 
effective november   we entered into asset purchase agreements with marnac and kdl whereby we effectively terminated the prior license agreement by purchasing  among other things  the pirfenidone related assets covered by such prior license agreement 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreements  we made acquisition payments of approximately million in contingent acquisition payments of up to an additional million would be made by us only if positive phase iii data and registration in the united states and european union are achieved

liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of operating losses  
table of contents partially offset by the receipt of million from our collaboration partner roche 
some of these available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our core operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
in addition  at any point in time we maintain balances that exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis  these cash balances could be impacted and we may be unable to access our cash if the underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date we have not experienced a lack of access to cash in any of our third party financial institution accounts 
included in the million of our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities at december  is a portion of our investment in targanta common stock which has a fair value of approximately million  reflecting the fair market value of approximately  shares at the quoted market price on that date 
the  shares of targanta common stock represent the portion of our holdings estimated to qualify for resale within one year 
our total holdings of targanta common stock had been approximately million shares 
in january  the medicines company announced its intent to acquire targanta for per share  or approximately million and on january  commenced a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of targanta 
we have tendered our shares and received approximately million in march upon closing of the transaction 
we may also receive up to an additional per share in contingent cash payments upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones within certain time periods 
in february  we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of our registered common stock  at a price of per share  and received net proceeds of approximately million 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure by imposing concentration limits and credit worthiness requirements for all corporate issuers 
at december   we held approximately million of student loan auction rate securities par value of million  classified as long term assets  which are substantially backed by the federal government 
beginning in february  auctions failed for the entire million of our auction rate securities and have continued to fail since 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the writedown of the carrying value of these securities as we believe the decline in market value is other than temporary in nature given the deteriorating credit and financial markets and specifically the auction rate securities market 
all of our auction rate securities are currently rated aaa  the highest rating by a rating agency 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record further impairment charges on these investments 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  including proceeds from our february public offering  and the recently announced results from our capacity trials  we currently anticipate the need to liquidate these investments prior to maturity or estimated time to recovery in order to execute our current business plans 
these investments were recorded at fair value as of december  based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
operating activities cash used in operating activities was million during the year ended december   comprised primarily of a net loss of million 
cash flows used in operating activities also reflects  among other things  stock based compensation expense of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation of million and an increase in other accrued liabilities of approximately million 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily due to the amounts owed to roche under the october collaboration agreement  which 
table of contents increased million in the increase in other accrued liabilities consists primarily of an increase in accrued clinical costs  reflecting the initiation of our recap clinical trial  the follow up to our recently completed capacity trials 
details concerning the loss from operations can be found above in this report under the heading results of operations 
investing activities investing activities provided million in cash flows during the year ended december   primarily due to investment maturities and sales of available for sale securities totaling million  partially offset by investment purchases of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  was due to the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock plans 
we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from sales of actimmune and proceeds from our february public offering  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  settlement with the government  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of however  this forward looking statement involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 
this forward looking statement is also based upon our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements  which may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to sales of actimmune or any of our product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  our ability to partner our programs or products  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates in development  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products and competitive barriers to entry  the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies  the payments of annual interest on our long term debt  the payments related to the civil settlement agreement with the government  the timing and size of the payments we may receive from roche pursuant to the collaboration agreement  and whether we must repay the principal in connection with our convertible debt obligations 
as a result  we may require additional funds beyond the proceeds received from our february public offering and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements 
table of contents with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no further commitments for such fund raising activities at this time 
additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or  if available  the terms for obtaining such funds may not be favorable or may result in dilution to our stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements 
we have no commercial commitments or loans with related parties 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities  such as milestone payments  for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions contractual obligations total after long term debt obligations government settlement operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations other research and development commitments total contractual cash obligations these amounts include accrued interest and principal amounts of both the convertible senior notes due and the convertible senior notes due these amounts do not reflect the impact of the million accelerated payment made in march to the us department of justice  though total obligation does not change 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these amounts consist of clinical related obligations 
these amounts consist of clinical  process development and other related obligations and are cancelable upon discontinuation of the trial 
they do not include any amounts related to the collaboration agreement with roche given the inherent difficulties in the estimation process 
the operating leases for our facilities require letters of credit secured by a restricted cash balance with our bank 
the amount of each letter of credit approximates six to twelve months of operating rent payable to the landlord of each facility 
recent accounting pronouncements on october   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  fsp fas 
this fsp  which was effective upon release  clarifies the application of fas in a market that is not active and provides guidance and examples to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
we considered the impact of fsp fas in evaluating the fair value of our auction rate securities 
in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf 
table of contents provides guidance on how to determine if certain instruments or embedded features are considered indexed to our own stock  including instruments similar to our convertible senior notes 
eitf requires companies to use a two step approach to evaluate an instrument s contingent exercise provisions and settlement provisions in determining whether the instrument is considered to be indexed to its own stock and exempt from the application of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
although eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   any outstanding instrument at the date of adoption will require a retrospective application of the accounting through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb that significantly impacts the accounting for convertible debt 
the fsp requires cash settled convertible debt  such as our convertible senior notes due march the notes that are currently outstanding  to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each component 
the value assigned to the debt component would be the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar bond without the conversion feature 
the difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value would be recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the bond 
although fsp apb has no impact on our actual past or future cash flows  it requires us to record non cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized 
fsp apb is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  and requires retrospective application to all periods presented 
early application is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption and based on our preliminary analysis of the requirements of fsp apb  we expect that the adoption of fsp apb will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
at its december meeting  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf in issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
the eitf concluded that a collaborative arrangement is one in which the participants are actively involved and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the ultimate commercial success of the endeavor 
revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and other accounting literature 
payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and presented based on the nature of the arrangement and its terms  the nature of the entity s business and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature 
the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements are to be disclosed along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements 
activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature  however  required disclosure under eitf applies to the entire collaborative agreement 
this issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement and have not determined whether it will have a material impact  but its adoption would not affect reported amounts of net loss 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue no 
eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities 
pursuant to eitf  nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or services are performed  or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be received 
effective january   we adopted eitf the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value where entities will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the standard allows entities to elect fair value application on an instrument by instrument basis with certain exceptions 
the fair value option election is irrevocable in most cases 
effective january   we adopted sfas and did not elect to adopt the fair value option under this statement 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
substantially all investments mature within approximately years from the date of purchase 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 

table of contents at december   we held approximately million at par of municipal notes investments  classified as noncurrent assets  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
commencing in february and continuing throughout the remainder of the year  auctions failed for the entire million of our auction rate securities and as a result our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
all of our auction rate securities are currently rated aaa  the highest rating by a rating agency 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record further impairment charges on these investments 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  including proceeds from our february public offering  and the recently announced results from our capacity trials  we currently anticipate the need to liquidate these investments prior to maturity or estimated time to recovery in order to execute our current business plans 
these investments were recorded at fair value as of december  based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of  based on data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of these securities 
given the current market environment  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change  which could result in significant changes to the fair value of these securities in future periods 
we used seven years as the expected holding period 
the following table presents hypothetical fair values of our auction rate securities had we used different underlying terms  including up to years which approximates the actual maturity dates of the securities in millions  except percentages expected term of cash flows in years five seven ten thirty estimated fair value percentage of original par value million the table below presents the original principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages and beyond total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate convertible senior notes due average interest rate 
table of contents the table below presents the original principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages and beyond total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate foreign currency market risk we purchase commercial and clinical products from bi and settle our obligations in a foreign currency 
this exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to protect against currency exchange risks on forecasted foreign currency cash payments for the purchases of actimmune from bi over the next year  we have considered instituting a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
in the past  we have hedged portions of our forecasted foreign currency cash payments with forward contracts 
when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies  the decline in the value of future foreign currency expenses is offset by losses in the value of the option or forward contracts designated as hedges 
conversely  when the dollar weakens  the increase in the value of future foreign currency expenses is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts 
in  we used foreign currency forward contracts to partially mitigate this exposure  but have not entered into any new foreign currency forward contracts since that time 
we regularly evaluate the cost benefit of entering into such arrangements  and presently have no foreign currency hedge agreements outstanding 
global market and economic conditions in the united states  recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth through the fourth quarter of for the fiscal year ended december   continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  a declining real estate market in the us and added concerns fueled by the federal government interventions in the us financial and credit markets have contributed to instability in both united states and international capital and credit markets and diminished expectations for the us and global economy 
these conditions  combined with volatile energy prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have in recent weeks subsequent to the end of the year and afterward contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels and an economic slowdown 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of capital and credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
if volatile and adverse market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely borrow or access the capital and credit markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the economic slowdown may lead to reduced opportunities to raise sufficient additional capital to enable us to fund future operations  which would have a negative impact on our business 
in addition  the biotechnology industry has fluctuated significantly in the past and has experienced significant downturns in connection with  or in anticipation of  a deterioration in general economic conditions and we cannot accurately predict how severe and prolonged any downturn might be
