we were able to outperform the industry by gaining market share and posting a increase in revpar 
our performance was largely attributable to our million hotel renovation program  which was substantially completed in as lodging demand slowed in  we worked closely with our brand managers to cut operating costs in the lower revpar environment 
many of our hotels were able to reduce labor costs permanently  and all of our hotels trimmed non critical functions 
this enabled us to maintain ebitda margins 
we entered in the midst of a recession 
our hotels are focused on maintaining market share  protecting adr and preserving ebitda margins  while we are focused on managing our balance sheet  including maturing debt and compliance with debt covenants 
we have million of non recourse mortgage debt  in the aggregate  that matures in of this debt  a million loan  secured by seven hotels  matures in april at the time of this filing we have agreed in principle on the material terms to refinance this loan for five years with prudential mortgage capital  one of the current lenders with respect to which we have paid a non refundable  portion of the origination fee and are negotiating final documentation 
we expect to close the refinancing prior to maturity  subject to documentation  due diligence and customary conditions 
we have a variety of financing alternatives in the unlikely event that we are unable to refinance this loan 
we also have two other non recourse mortgage loans aggregating million  secured by two hotels  that mature in  we expect to repay these loans through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings 
our line of credit contains certain restrictive financial covenants  with which we were in compliance at the date of this filing 
our compliance with these covenants in future periods will depend substantially on the financial results of our hotels 
if current financial market conditions persist and our business continues to deteriorate  we may breach one or more of our financial covenants 
we have agreed in principle on the material terms with the lead lender of a new million term loan  which would be secured by first mortgages on eight currently unencumbered hotels and  assuming all extension options are exercised  will not mature until this loan would not be subject to any corporate financial covenants and would only be recourse to the borrower  a to be formed wholly owned subsidiary 
while we believe that we will successfully close our new secured term loan  as discussed above  we have several other alternatives available to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants or repay our line of credit  including identifying other sources of debt or equity financing  selling unencumbered hotels and or implementing additional cost cutting measures 
of course  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to close our new secured term loan  identify additional sources of debt or equity financing or sell hotels on terms that are favorable or otherwise acceptable to us 
in  we embarked on a million renovation program at our portfolio designed to improve the quality  returns on investment and competitive positions of these hotels 
in  we substantially completed these renovations 
we believe that our renovated hotels will continue to perform better than the industry average for at least the first year following renovation 
in  we began the process of rebranding our property in san francisco union square as a marriott hotel 
the comprehensive renovation includes guest rooms  guest baths  guest corridors  meeting space  food and beverage outlets  public areas and building exterior and will be completed by mid marriott took over management of the hotel in december  which is operating as hotel until it is reflagged as a marriott hotel in april we regularly review and evaluate our hotel portfolio and may from time to time identify additional hotels to sell based upon strategic considerations such as future supply growth  changes in demand dynamics  concentration risk  strategic fit  return on future capital needs and return on invested capital 
we currently have five hotels identified for sale we intend to hold these hotels as long as necessary to obtain satisfactory pricing and may identify additional hotels for sale in the future 
in  we tested eight hotels that had been identified as sale candidates of which three no longer are sale candidates and five hotels remain sale candidates for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
using undiscounted estimated cash flows over a shortened estimated remaining hold period 
of the hotels tested  four failed the test under sfas no 
 which failure resulted in million of impairment charges  during the nine months ended september   to write down these hotel assets to our then current estimate of fair market value before selling expenses 
as a result of the short term hold period and the deteriorating market conditions  we tested our five remaining sale candidate hotels for impairment in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in an additional million impairment charge on two hotels that failed this test 
because of triggering events in related to changes in the capital markets  the drop in travel demand and the combined effect on our stock price  we tested all of our hotel assets to determine if further assessment for potential impairment was required for any of our hotels 
we had one hotel with a short term ground lease  in addition to the sale candidates noted above  fail this test 
we determined that the book value of this hotel was not fully recoverable  and as such  recorded a million impairment charge under sfas no 
in  we declared and paid common dividends of per share in the aggregate 
we suspended payment of our quarterly common dividend in december in light of the deepening recession  the attendant impact on our industry and felcor  and the severe contraction in the capital markets 
our board of directors will determine the amount of future common and preferred dividends for each quarter  based upon various factors including operating results  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as the minimum reit distribution requirements

for the year  revpar increased from to 
the increase in revpar consisted of a increase in occupancy and a slight increase in adr  while the united states hotel industry saw a decline in revpar for the year  driven by declining occupancy 
we attribute our better than average revpar performance to increases in market share at our consolidated hotels upon completion of our three year renovation program 
as with the overall industry  our revpar began to weaken in the third quarter of and our revpar declined in the fourth quarter of  compared to the same period in our renovation program has enabled us to increase our market share significantly and maintain year over year revpar better than the national average and our peer lodging reits 
we expect the deterioration of travel demand to continue through  and we have focused on mitigating the declining revenue until lodging fundamentals stabilize 
one area that we have focused on is working with our management companies to retool hotel level cost structures including staffing models to ensure that expenses are being managed as effectively as possible 
to this end  our hotels were successful in limiting hotel ebitda margin loss to basis points in compared to the same period in results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  compared to net income applicable to common stockholders of million in our loss included impairment charges of million million related to consolidated hotels and million related to equity method investments  accrued liquidated damages of million and hurricane related expenses of million 
these charges were partially offset by a gain related to involuntary conversions from the final settlement of hurricane claims of million and an adjustment to gains from prior year hotel sales of million 
our net income applicable to common stockholders included million of i gains from sale of hotels million  million in discontinued operations and million in income from unconsolidated entities  ii gain from the sale of condominiums million  and iii operating income from hotels sold in and included in discontinued operations million 
our results of operations include two hotels acquired in december as such  our financial statements reflect increases in revenues and expenses associated with these hotels that are not reflected in our financial statements 
our total revenues increased million compared to  of which million related to the two hotels acquired in december the remainder of the increase is principally attributable to the increase in revpar at our consolidated hotels from to hotel departmental expenses increased million compared to  of which million is attributable to the two hotels acquired in december and the remainder primarily reflects expenses associated with increased occupancy compared to as a percentage of total revenue  hotel departmental expenses increased from to compared to rooms expense decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to  but food and beverage expense increased as a percent of total revenue from to  and other operating department expenses increased as a percent of total revenue from to compared to the increases in food and beverage expense and other department expenses as a percent of total revenue are primarily due to the mix and nature of the business of the two hotels acquired in december  which are both resort properties 
adr at these hotels was nearly higher than the remainder of the portfolio in  which was the principal reason for the improvement in rooms expense as a percentage of total revenue 
food and beverage generally has significantly higher expenses as a percent of revenue than rooms  and those hotels contributed of our food and beverage revenue during other property related costs increased million  compared to  of which million related to the two hotels acquired in december as a percentage of total revenue  other property operating costs remained essentially unchanged at in compared to in management and franchise fees increased million  compared to  of which million resulted primarily from increases in revenue and million related to the two hotels acquired in december there was essentially no change in management and franchise fees as a percentage of revenue in compared to taxes  insurance and lease expense decreased million compared to  despite a million increase related to the two hotels acquired in december the decrease from is primarily related to a decrease in percentage rent expense of million  related to percentage leases reset in late  a decrease in property taxes of million  largely from reduced assessed values and successful resolution of prior year property taxes disputed  and a decrease in property insurance of million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million compared to  of which increase million related to the two hotels acquired in december the remainder of the increase reflects increased depreciation associated with hotel capital expenditures million in and million in 
in  we identified eight hotels as candidates to be sold  of which five remain candidates for sale 
we tested these hotels for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
using undiscounted estimated cash flows over a shortened estimated remaining hold period 
of the hotels tested  four hotels failed the test under sfas no 
 as a result of which we recorded impairment charges of million through the nine months ended september   to write down these hotel assets to our then current estimate of their fair market value before selling expenses 
as a result of the short term hold period and the deteriorating market conditions  we recorded additional impairment charges totaling million on two of these hotels in the fourth quarter of because of triggering events in related to changes in the capital markets  dropping travel demand and the combined effect on our stock price  we tested all of our hotel assets to determine if further assessment for potential impairment was required for any of our hotels 
we had one hotel with a short term ground lease  in addition to the sale candidates noted above  fail this test 
we determined that the book value of this hotel was not fully recoverable  and as such  recorded a million impairment charge for this hotel under sfas no 
other expenses increased million compared to this increase was primarily attributable to i hurricane related clean up expenses of million related to of our hotels affected by four hurricanes in  ii severance costs of million related to the staffing reductions at our hotels  and iii amortization of intangible assets of million related to the hotels acquired in december net interest expense increased million compared to this change is primarily attributable to i a decrease in interest income of million due to lower cash balances and interest rates earned on those balances  ii an increase in interest expense of million related to the mortgage debt on the two hotels acquired in december  and iii a reduction in capitalized interest of million related to lower renovation related construction in progress  all of which was partially offset by lower interest expense of million due to lower interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt 
equity in income loss from unconsolidated entities decreased by million compared to  which decrease primarily reflects income received from the gain of million  on the sale of an unconsolidated hotel during the first quarter of  impairment charges of million recorded in  and resetting several percentage leases in late the impairment charges were comprised of million of which our share was million taken under sfas no 
and million taken under apb  related to other than temporary declines in value of certain equity method investments 
the impairment under apb includes a charge of million for one investment related to a hotel that we do not intend to sell 
in  we settled insurance claims relating to hurricane losses and realized a related million gain from involuntary conversion 
in  we finalized the sale of of the units at our royale palms condominium project and recognized a related million gain on sale under the completed contract method 
discontinued operations included a million adjustment to increase gains on sale related to a revision in taxes associated with gains aggregating million from hotel sales in and discontinued operations for included operating income of million  charges related to early debt repayment of million  and minority interest expense of million related to the hotels we sold in discontinued operations also included gains of million related to the sale of hotels during the first six months of comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded net income applicable to common stockholders of million  compared to million in we had income from continuing operations of million compared to a prior year income from continuing operations of million 
in  income from continuing operations included an million gain from the sale of condominium units at our royale palms condominium project in myrtle beach  south carolina 
income from continuing operations in included an aggregate of million of charges related to early retirement of debt 
total revenue from continuing operations increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue is principally attributed to a increase in revpar 
the increase in revpar resulted from a increase in adr  net of a drop in occupancy  and represents both industry revpar increases in many of our major markets and improvements in revpar at our recently renovated hotels 
renovation related disruption had an adverse effect on our adr  occupancy and hotel ebitda margin in our hotel ebitda margin decreased by basis points compared to for  total operating expenses increased by million and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to compared to hotel departmental expenses  which consist of rooms expense  food and beverage expense  and other operating departments  increased million compared to  and decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue from to 
other property operating costs  which consist of general and administrative costs  marketing costs  repairs and maintenance  utilities expense  and other costs  increased by million compared to  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
all of the other property operating costs remained constant or decreased as a percent of total revenue compared to except for repair and maintenance cost  which increased slightly as a percent of total revenue from to 
management and franchise fees increased by million compared to but remained constant at of total revenue 
taxes  insurance and lease expense increased by million compared to and increased slightly from to of total revenue 
we had increases as a percentage of total revenue in property insurance 
increased property insurance premiums reflect the nationwide trend of increased rates related to catastrophic coverage  but we are currently seeing a softening of property insurance costs 
corporate expenses decreased by million compared to and decreased basis points as a percentage of total revenue 
the decrease in corporate expenses is principally attributed to expenses related to severance costs from executives who left the company in and a reduction in corporate bonus paid in depreciation and amortization expense increased by million compared to  which reflects the significant capital expenditures spent in connection with our renovation program in and net interest expense decreased by million in compared to the principal reason for the reduction in interest expense is attributed to reduction in average debt outstanding from billion in to billion in and a basis point decrease in our weighted average interest rate 
during  we refinanced million of our senior notes and million of our mortgage debt at lower interest rates  and we recognized a full year benefit from this in the early retirement of debt in resulted in net debt extinguishment costs of million  of which million was recorded in discontinued operations 
the early retirement of debt in resulted in debt extinguishment costs of million  all of which was recorded in discontinued operations 
equity in income from unconsolidated entities was million in compared to million in that increase reflects improved revpar and a million net gain from the sale of two unconsolidated hotels in in  we completed construction of our unit royale palms condominium project in myrtle beach  south carolina 
through december   we sold of the units and recognized a gain of million 
discontinued operations provided net income of million in compared to million in included in discontinued operations at december  and  are the operating income or loss  direct interest costs and gains on sale related to the hotels sold in and hotels sold in gains on sale aggregating million and million were included in and income from discontinued operations  respectively

these measures  including ffo  same store ffo  ebitda  same store ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  are measures of our financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap

substantially all of our non current assets consist of real estate 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors consider supplemental measures of performance  which are not measures of operating performance under gaap  to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
these supplemental measures  including ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  are not measures of operating performance under gaap 
however  we consider these non gaap measures to be supplemental measures of a reit s performance and should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income as a measure of our operating performance 
ffo and ebitda the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit 
this may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition  or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries 
we define ebitda as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap plus interest expenses  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ebitda on the same basis 
to derive same store comparisons  we have adjusted ffo and ebitda to remove discontinued operations and gains on sales of condominium units  and have added the historical results of operations from the two hotels acquired in december hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are commonly used measures of performance in the hotel industry and give investors a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our individual hotels and operating managers have direct control 
we believe that hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are useful to investors by providing greater transparency with respect to two significant measures used by us in our financial and operational decision making 
additionally  using these measures facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
we present hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin by eliminating corporate level expenses  depreciation and amortization  and expenses related to our capital structure 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management in running our business on a property level basis 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization because  even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  we do not believe that these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  and implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  accurately reflect an adjustment in the value of our assets 
we also eliminate consolidated percentage rent paid to unconsolidated entities  which is effectively eliminated by minority interest expense and equity in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries  and include the cost of unconsolidated taxes  insurance and lease expense  to reflect the entire operating costs applicable to our consolidated hotels 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margins are presented on a same store basis including the historical results of operations from the two hotels acquired in december use and limitations of non gaap measures our management and board of directors use ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we use hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin in evaluating hotel level performance and the operating efficiency of our hotel managers 
the use of these non gaap financial measures has certain limitations 
ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  as presented by us  may not be comparable to ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin as calculated by other real estate companies 
these measures do not reflect certain expenses that we incurred and will incur  such as depreciation  interest and capital expenditures 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures  and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit  cash flow from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
neither should ffo  ffo per share or ebitda be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions or service our debt 
ffo per share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders 
ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to the corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 
liquidity and capital resources hotel operations provide most of the cash needed to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to stockholders and repayments of indebtedness 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of hotel operations  was million 
at december   we had cash on hand of million  including approximately million held pursuant to management agreements with our independent management companies to meet minimum working capital requirements 
in  we declared and paid common dividends of per share in the aggregate 
we suspended payment of our quarterly common dividend in december in light of the deepening recession  the attendant impact on our industry and felcor  and the severe contraction in the capital markets 
our board of directors will determine the amount of future common and preferred dividends for each quarter  based upon various factors including operating results  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as the minimum reit distribution requirements 
we have million of non recourse mortgage debt  in the aggregate  that matures in of this debt  a million loan  secured by seven hotels  matures in april at the time of this filing we have agreed in principle on the material terms to refinance this loan for five years with prudential mortgage capital  one of the current lenders with respect to which we have paid a non refundable  portion of the origination fee and are negotiating final documentation 
we expect to close the refinancing prior to maturity  subject to documentation  due diligence and customary conditions 
we have a variety of financing alternatives in the unlikely event that we are unable to refinance this loan 
we also have two other non recourse mortgage loans aggregating million  secured by two hotels  that mature in  we expect to repay these loans through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings 
we have agreed in principle on the material terms of a new million term loan  which would be secured by first mortgages on eight currently unencumbered hotels and  assuming all extension options are exercised  will not mature until this loan would not be subject to any corporate financial covenants and would only be recourse to the borrower  a to be formed wholly owned subsidiary 
the material terms of this loan have been approved by jpmorgan securities inc as lead arranger  and jpmorgan chase bank  na as administrative agent  which will provide a portion of the loan 
proceeds from this loan will be used for general working capital purposes and to repay the outstanding balance on our line of credit which will be cancelled upon repayment 
we expect to close this new loan  subject to other lenders approval  documentation  due diligence and customary conditions  by the end of april 
our line of credit contains certain restrictive financial covenants  such as a minimum leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio to  and a minimum unencumbered leverage ratio 
at the date of this filing we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
our compliance with these covenants in future periods will depend substantially on the financial results of our hotels 
if current financial market conditions persist and our business continues to deteriorate  we may breach one or more of our financial covenants 
if we are unable to repay our line of credit  and we breach one or more of these financial covenants  we would be in default  which could allow the lenders to demand payment of all amounts outstanding under our line of credit 
additionally  a demand for payment following a financial covenant default by our lenders constitutes an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes  which in turn  could accelerate our obligation to repay the amounts outstanding under our senior notes 
while we believe that we will successfully close our new secured term loan  as discussed above  we have several other alternatives available to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants or repay our line of credit  including identifying other sources of debt or equity financing  selling unencumbered hotels and or implementing additional cost cutting measures 
of course  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to close our new secured term loan  identify additional sources of debt or equity financing or sell hotels on terms that are favorable or otherwise acceptable to us 
we currently expect approximately to million of cash flow provided by operating activities for this forecast assumes revpar decreases to and hotel ebitda margins decreases by approximately to basis points 
our current operating plan contemplates that we will make no common dividend payments  million of preferred dividend payments  million in normal recurring principal payments and million repayment of maturing mortgage debt leaving approximately million to million in surplus cash flow before capital expenditures or additional debt reduction 
in  we plan to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  which will be funded from operating cash flow and borrowings 
in  we identified two holiday inn hotels in florida operating under management agreements with ihg as candidates to be sold 
these hotels were originally designated for redevelopment with condominiums  but market conditions in florida no longer make these condominium projects feasible 
we also determined that the major capital expenditures necessary to retain the holiday inn flags at these hotels were not in the best interests of our stockholders  given the shortened hold period for these hotels 
we have agreed with ihg that the management agreements for one hotel will be terminated june   and the other hotel will be terminated december  following termination or earlier sale of each hotel  we will be required to pay replacement management fees for up to one year and liquidated damages net of any replacement management fees previously paid at the end of that year  or reinvest in another hotel to be managed by ihg and carrying an ihg brand 
given the current state of the economy and the market for hotel acquisitions  sale of either hotel or substitution of a replacement hotel appear unlikely prior to the relevant dates  and we will likely have to pay ihg at least some portion of replacement management fees and or liquidated damages 
liquidated damages are computed based on operating results of a hotel prior to termination  and we expect that the aggregate liability related to these hotels  if paid  could be approximately million 
we have accrued the full amount of liquidated damages in the capital markets  and our access to financing on reasonably acceptable terms or not at all  have historically been affected by external events and circumstances  including the current recession  major bank failures  the subprime mortgage crisis  rising unemployment  shrinking gdp  acts of terrorism  etc 
events  or circumstances of similar magnitude or impact  could adversely affect the availability and cost of our capital going forward 
in addition  if the recession in the overall economy and the lodging industry continues  our operating cash flow and the availability and cost of capital for our business will be adversely affected 
we are subject to increases in hotel operating expenses  including wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  utilities and insurance expenses  that can fluctuate disproportionately to revenues 
operating expenses are difficult to predict and control  which can produce volatility in our operating results 
if our hotel revpar decreases and or hotel ebitda margins shrink  our operations  earnings and or cash flow could be adversely effected 
during  we spent million in capital expenditures on our consolidated and unconsolidated hotels  including our pro rata share of joint venture capital expenditures 
this amount includes both renovation and redevelopment projects 
we capitalize interest and certain other costs  such as property taxes  land leases  property insurance and employee costs relating to hotels undergoing major renovations and redevelopments 
we cease capitalizing these costs to projects when construction is substantially complete 
in   and  we capitalized million  million and million of such costs  respectively 
because of the reduced level of renovation work compared to prior years  we expect to capitalize less of these costs in debt line of credit 
at december   we had million outstanding under our line of credit and the interest rate on our line of credit was libor plus 
under some circumstances we may be restricted from drawing the full amount under our line of credit 
our million line of credit contains certain restrictive financial covenants  including a leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  unencumbered leverage ratio and maximum payout ratio 
the interest rate on our line can range from to basis points over libor  based on our leverage ratio as defined in our line of credit agreement 
in addition to financial covenants  our line of credit includes certain other affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on our ability to create or acquire wholly owned subsidiaries  restrictions on the operation ownership of our hotels  limitations on our ability to lease property or guarantee leases of other persons  limitations on our ability to make restricted payments such as distributions on common and preferred stock  share repurchases and certain investments  limitations on our ability to merge or consolidate with other persons  to issue stock of our subsidiaries and to sell all or substantially all of our assets  restrictions on our ability to make investments in condominium developments  limitations on our ability to change the nature of our business  limitations on our ability to modify certain instruments  to create liens  to enter into transactions with affiliates  and limitations on our ability to enter into joint ventures 
at the date of this filing  we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
our compliance with these covenants in future periods will depend substantially on the financial results of our hotels 
if current financial market conditions persist and our business continues to deteriorate  we may breach one or more of our financial covenants 
our other borrowings contain affirmative and negative covenants that are generally equal to or less restrictive than our line of credit 
payment of amounts due under our line of credit is guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries who also guarantee payment of our senior notes and payment is secured by a pledge of our limited partnership interest in felcor lp 
mortgage debt 
at december   we had aggregate mortgage indebtedness of approximately million that was secured by of our consolidated hotels with an aggregate book value of approximately billion 
our hotel mortgage debt is recourse solely to the specific assets securing the debt  except in the case of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse carve out provisions 
loans secured by four hotels provide for lock box arrangements under certain circumstances 
with respect to two of these loans  we are permitted to retain of budgeted hotel operating expenses  but the remaining revenues would become subject to a lock box arrangement if a specified debt service coverage ratio is not met 
these hotels currently exceed the minimum debt service coverage ratio  however  under the terms of the loan agreement  the lock box provisions remain in place until the loan is repaid 
none of these hotels has ever fallen below the debt service coverage ratio 
with respect to the mortgage debt at two of our hotels  all cash from the hotels in excess of operating expenses  taxes  insurance and capital expenditure reserves is subject to lock box arrangements 
in each case  the lender holds lock box funds that are first applied to meet current debt service obligations and any excess funds are held in the lock box account until the relevant hotel meets or exceeds a debt service coverage ratio of at december   the debt service coverage ratio for both hotels was above our hotel mortgage debt is non recourse to us and contains provisions allowing for the substitution of collateral upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
most of our mortgage debt is prepayable  subject to various prepayment  yield maintenance or defeasance obligations 
senior notes 
our publicly traded senior notes require that we satisfy total leverage  secured leverage and interest coverage tests in order to incur additional indebtedness except to refinance maturing debt with replacement debt  as defined under our indentures  pay dividends in excess of the minimum dividend required to meet the reit qualification test  repurchase capital stock  or merge 
as of the date of this filing  we have satisfied all such tests 
under the terms of one of our indentures  we are prohibited from repurchasing any of our capital stock  whether common or preferred  subject to certain exceptions  so long as our debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the indentures  exceeds to  which it does at the date of this filing 
debt  as defined in the indentures  approximates our consolidated debt 
ebitda is defined in the indentures as consolidated gaap net income  adjusted for minority interest in felcor lp  actual cash distributions by unconsolidated entities  gains or losses from asset sales  dividends on preferred stock and extraordinary gains and losses as defined at the date of the indentures  plus interest expense  income taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense and other non cash items 
in addition  if we were unable to continue to satisfy the incurrence test under the indentures governing our senior notes  we may be prohibited from  among other things  incurring any additional indebtedness  except under certain specific exceptions  or paying dividends on our preferred or common stock  except to the extent necessary to satisfy the reit qualification requirement that we distribute currently at least of our taxable income 
interest rate caps 
to fulfill requirements under certain loans  we owned interest rate caps with aggregate notional amounts of million as of december  and these interest rate cap agreements have not been designated as hedges and have insignificant fair values at both december  and  resulting in no significant net earnings impact

the following schedule details these obligations at december  in thousands total less than year years years after years debt a b operating leases purchase obligations ihg liquidated damages total contractual obligations a our long term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest

of the remaining joint venture hotels  we own approximately of the lessees operating hotels and one hotel joint venture is operated without a lease 
we also owned a interest in entities that provide condominium management services and develop condominiums in myrtle beach  south carolina 
none of our directors  officers or employees owns any interest in any of these joint ventures or entities 
the hotel joint ventures had million of non recourse mortgage debt relating to these hotels  of which our pro rata portion was million  none of which is reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
our liabilities with regard to non recourse debt and the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are members or partners in joint ventures are generally limited to guarantees of the borrowing entity s obligations to pay for the lender s losses caused by misconduct  fraud or misappropriation of funds by the venture and other typical exceptions from the non recourse provisions in the mortgages  such as for environmental liabilities 
we have recorded equity in income loss of unconsolidated entities of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and received distributions of million of which million was provided from operations  million of which million was provided from operations  and million of which million was provided from operations for the years  and  respectively 
the principal source of income for our hotel joint ventures is percentage lease revenue from their operating lessees 
capital expenditures on the hotels owned by our hotel joint ventures are generally funded from the income from operations of these ventures 
however  if a venture has insufficient cash flow to meet operating expenses or make necessary capital improvements  the venture may make a capital call upon the venture members or partners to fund such necessary improvements 
it is possible that  in the event of a capital call  the other joint venture member or partner may be unwilling or unable to make the necessary capital contributions 
under such circumstances  we may elect to make the other party s contribution as a loan to the venture or as an additional capital contribution by us 
under certain circumstances  a capital contribution by us may increase our equity investment to greater than and may require that we consolidate the venture  including all of its assets and liabilities  into our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to those ventures that are partnerships  the hotels owned by these ventures could perform below expectations and result in the insolvency of the ventures and the acceleration of their debts  unless the members or partners provide additional capital 
in some ventures  the members or partners may be required to make additional capital contributions or have their interest in the venture be reduced or offset for the benefit of any party making the required investment on their behalf 
we may be faced with the choice of losing our investment in a venture or investing additional capital under circumstances that do not assure a return on that investment 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  require us to reduce room rates in the near term and may limit our ability to raise room rates in the future 
we are also subject to the risk that inflation will cause increases in hotel operating expenses disproportionately to revenues 
seasonality the lodging business is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may utilize cash on hand or borrowings to satisfy our obligations or make distributions to our equity holders 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  the carrying value of investments in hotels  litigation  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in one or more of our hotels held for investment has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis  or net book value  of the investment 
we test for impairment when certain events occur  including one or more of the following projected cash flows are significantly less than recent historical cash flows  significant changes in legal factors or actions by a regulator that could affect the value of our hotels  events that could cause changes or uncertainty in travel patterns  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a hotel will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in the evaluation of impairment of our hotels  and in establishing impairment charges  we made many assumptions and estimates on a hotel by hotel basis  which included the following annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  holding periods  expected remaining useful lives of assets  estimates in fair values taking into consideration future cash flows  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices  and future capital expenditures 
we are also required under gaap to record an impairment charge when one or more of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries experiences an other than temporary decline in fair value 
any decline in fair value that is not expected to be recovered in the next months is considered other than temporary 
we record an impairment in our equity based investments as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
our estimates of fair values are based on future cash flow estimates  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
changes in these estimates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying hotels could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of our hotels or investments in unconsolidated entities  thereby requiring future impairment charges 
we capitalize interest and certain other costs  such as property taxes  land leases  and property insurance and employee costs related to hotels undergoing major renovations and redevelopments 
such costs capitalized in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we make estimates with regard to when components of the renovated asset or redevelopment project are taken out of service or placed in service when determining the appropriate amount and time to capitalize these costs 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we could capitalize too much or too little with regard to a particular project 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation and amortization expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
any remaining unallocated acquisition costs are treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations prepared by management and or independent third parties 
identifiable intangible assets typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contr act values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources such as those obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
we make estimates with respect to contingent liabilities for losses covered by insurance in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting for contingencies fas 
we record liabilities for self insured losses under our insurance programs when it becomes probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we are self insured for the first  per occurrence  of our general liability claims with regard to of our hotels 
we review the adequacy of our reserves for our self insured claims on a regular basis 
our reserves are intended to cover the estimated ultimate uninsured liability for losses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred at the end of each accounting period 
these reserves represent estimates at a given date  generally utilizing projections based on claims  historical settlement of claims and estimates of future costs to settle claims 
estimates are also required since there may be delays in reporting 
because establishment of insurance reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be sufficient 
if our insurance reserves of million  at december   for general liability losses are insufficient  we will record an additional expense in future periods 
property and catastrophic losses are event driven losses and  as such  until a loss occurs and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
we had recorded no contingent liabilities with regard to property or catastrophic losses at december  our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  have cumulative potential future tax deductions totaling million 
the net deferred income tax asset associated with these potential future tax deductions was million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to of our million deferred tax asset related to our trss  because of the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the deferred tax asset 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
in accordance with sfas  we have con sidered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase operating income in the period such determination was made 
recent changes to accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
this statement clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy  giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data 
sfas applies whenever other standards require assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas also provides for certain disclosure requirements  including  but not limited to  the valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques  if any  during the period 
this statement was effective for us on january   except for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis  for which the effective date is january  the adoption of this standard as it relates to financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  and we do not believe that the adoption of this standard on january  as it relates to non financial assets and liabilities will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
the election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes ie  unrealized gains and losses in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
additionally  sfas allowed for a one time election for existing positions upon adoption  with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings 
this statement was effective for us on january  we did not make the one time election upon adoption and therefore  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer shall recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
this statement is effective for us for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  the adoption of this standard on january  could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate  as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our prior practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which establishes and expands accounting and reporting standards for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests  in a subsidiary and the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position other than the recharacterization of minority interests 
in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities  including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas was effective on january  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operation
