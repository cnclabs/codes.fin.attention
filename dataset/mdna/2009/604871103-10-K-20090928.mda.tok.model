results of operation the following discussion and analysis provides information which the company s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
all of the company s sales to date have been derived from the sale of medical device products  which include manufacture and distribution of ultrasonic medical device products  and laboratory and scientific products  which include ultrasonic equipment for scientific and laboratory purposes  and ductless fume enclosures for filtration of gaseous emissions in laboratories and hospitals 
on april   the company sold the assets of its ultrasonic laboratory products business to isonix for a cash payment of million 
the gain on the sale plus the results of operations from the ultrasonic laboratory products business are shown net of tax from discontinued operations 
fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales decreased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this difference in net sales is principally due to a decrease in medical device products sales of  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this difference in net sales is also due to an increase in sales of laboratory and scientific products of  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease in sales of medical device products is principally due to a decrease in sales of diagnostic medical device products of  and a decrease in therapeutic products of  the decrease in sales of diagnostic medical device products was not attributable to any one customer or product 
the increase in sales of laboratory and scientific products is due to a  increase in labcaire products sales  partially offset by a decrease in ductless fume enclosure product sales and a decrease in sales of wet scrubber products 
the company has intentionally limited the opportunities it pursues for wet scrubber products 
the increase in labcaire sales of  is due to new service contract and disposable sales 
export sales from the united states are remitted in us dollars and export sales for labcaire are remitted in english pounds 
ukhifu sales are remitted in english pounds and misonix  ltd 
sales to date have been remitted in english pounds and euros 
to the extent that the company s revenues are generated in english pounds  its operating results were translated for reporting purposes into us dollars using weighted average rates of and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
a weakening of the english pound and euro  in relation to the us dollar  will have the effect of increasing recorded revenues and profits  while a weakening of the english pound and euro will have the opposite effect 
since the company s operations in england generally set prices and bids for contracts in english pounds  a strengthening of the english pound  while increasing the value of its uk assets  might place the company at a pricing disadvantage in bidding for work from manufacturers based overseas 
the company collects its receivables predominately in the currency of the country the subsidiary resides in 
the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions  which include forward exchange agreements

upon recording the capital gain on the sale of the company s ultrasonic laboratory products business  the valuation allowance was reversed to the extent of offsetting the capital gain against the capital losses 
the effective tax rate in fiscal of was favorably impacted by an additional  of research and experimentation credits provided by the enactment of the tax relief and healthcare act of hr which retroactively extended the tax credit for research and experimentation expenditures 
the fiscal effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of permanent differences related to sfasr stock based compensation and non deductible entertainment expenses on taxable income

critical accounting policies general financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the sec in december  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report includes a summary of the company s significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill  property  plant and equipment and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following are our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  principally trade  are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors aging reports  collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower cost determined by the first in  first out method or market 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
our evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales by product  projections of future demand by product  the risk of technological or competitive obsolescence for our products  general market conditions  and the feasibility of reworking or using excess or obsolete products or components in the production or assembly of other products that are not obsolete or for which we do not have excess quantities in inventory 
to the extent that we determine there are excess or obsolete quantities  we record valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related products to adjust their carrying value to estimated net realizable value 
if future demand or market conditions are different from our projections  or if we are unable to rework excess or obsolete quantities into other products  we may change the recorded amount of inventory valuation reserves through a charge or reduction in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost 
the company capitalizes items in excess of  minor replacements and maintenance and repair expenses are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the useful life of the related asset  whichever is shorter 
inventory items included in property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of to years 
we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of specific assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the specific asset or group of assets 
if the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge would be recorded 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on our experience and internal business plans 
our internal business plans require judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of an asset or group of assets may materially affect our evaluation of the recoverability of the asset values currently recorded 
revenue recognition the company records revenue upon shipment for products shipped fob shipping point 
products shipped fob destination points are recorded as revenue when received at the point of destination 
shipments under agreements with distributors are not subject to return  and payment for these shipments is not contingent on sales by the distributor 
the company recognizes revenue on shipments to distributors in the same manner as with other customers 
fees from exclusive license agreements are recognized ratably over the terms of the respective agreements 
service contract and royalty income are recognized when earned 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the company s acquisitions of the common stock of labcaire  of the common stock of sonora and the acquisitions of assets of fibra sonics  sonic technologies and cramar and an equity interest in ukhifu 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas nos 
sfas and sfas  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
sfas replaced accounting principles board apb opinion business combinations and requires the use of the purchase method for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate goodwill might be impaired 
with the adoption of sfas  as of july   the company reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets to make any necessary amortization period adjustments 
we review goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of significant assets or products 
application of these impairment tests requires significant judgments  including estimation of cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in the projected cash flows and discount rate estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation of identifiable intangible assets  in process research and development  and goodwill could materially affect the determination of fair value at acquisition or during subsequent periods when tested for impairment 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests for fiscal and in the respective fourth quarter 
there were no indicators that goodwill recorded was impaired 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
stock based compensation prior to july   the company accounted for stock option plans under sfas no 
as permitted under this standard  compensation cost was recognized using the intrinsic value method described in apb no 
effective july   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas no 
r and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
using the modified prospective transition method  therefore  prior periods have not been restated 
the fair value of the stock options is estimated based upon option price  volatility  the risk free rate  and the average time the shares are held 
it is then amortized over the vesting period 
see note of the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stock based compensation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on short term investments and foreign exchange rates  which generate translation gains and losses due to the english pound to us dollar conversion of labcaire 
foreign exchange rates approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal were received in british pounds 
to the extent that the company s revenues are generated in british pounds  its operating results are translated for reporting purposes into us dollars using weighted average rates of and for the fiscal year ended june  and  respectively 
a strengthening of the british pound  in relation to the us dollar  will have the effect of increasing reported revenues and profits  while a weakening of the british pound will have the opposite effect 
since the company s operations in england generally sets prices and bids for contracts in british pounds  a strengthening of the british pound  while increasing the value of its uk assets  might place the company at a pricing disadvantage in bidding for work from manufacturers based overseas 
the company collects its receivables predominately in the currency of the country the subsidiary resides in 
misonix  ltd 
invoices certain customers in euros and as a result there is an exchange rate exposure between the british pound and the euro 
the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions  which include forward exchange agreements
