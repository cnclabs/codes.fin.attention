recent developments and overview on may   we entered into the transaction agreement with sprint  comcast  time warner cable  bright house  google and intel  in an effort to expedite the development of a nationwide wireless broadband network  expedite the commercial availability of wireless broadband services over the wireless broadband network  enable the offering of a greater depth and breadth of wireless broadband services and promote wireless broadband development 
pursuant to the transaction agreement  the assets of old clearwire and its subsidiaries before the consummation of the transactions were combined with the spectrum and certain other assets associated with the development and operations of the sprint wimax business  with the investors contributing an aggregate of billion in cash to the combined company 
in connection with the closing  we entered into various commercial agreements with sprint and the investors 
the closing occurred on november  as a result of the transactions  each share of old clearwire  which we refer to as old clearwire class a common stock was converted into the right to receive one share of clearwire class a common stock  and each option and warrant to purchase shares of old clearwire class a common stock was converted into an option or warrant  as applicable  to purchase the same number of shares of clearwire class a common stock in clearwire 
after the transactions  sprint and the investors  other than google  own shares of clearwire class b common stock  which have equal voting rights to clearwire class a common stock  but have only limited economic rights 
unlike the holders of clearwire class a common stock  the holders of clearwire class b common stock have no right to dividends and no right to any proceeds on liquidation other than the par value of the clearwire class b

sprint and the investors  other than google  hold their economic rights through ownership of clearwire communications class b common interests 
in exchange for its investment  google initially received million shares of clearwire class a common stock 
in addition  at the closing  we entered into several commercial agreements with sprint and certain of the investors relating to  among other things  access rights to towers that sprint owns or leases  resales by us and certain investors of bundled second generation wireless communications  which we refer to as g  and third generation wireless communications  which we refer to as g services  from sprint  resales by sprint and certain investors of our fourth generation wireless broadband  which we refer to as g  services  most favored reseller status with respect to economic and non economic terms of certain service agreements  collective development of new g services  creation of desktop and mobile applications on the clearwire network  the embedding of wimax chips into various clearwire network devices and the development of internet services and protocols 
as a result of our entering into certain of the commercial agreements with sprint and the investors in connection with the transactions  we expect to increase our distribution opportunities  thereby permitting us to expand our subscriber base and increase revenues 
business segments we comply with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards  which we refer to as sfas  no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise s operating segments and related disclosures about its products  services  geographic areas and major customers 
operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker  which we refer to as the codm  in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
operating segments can be aggregated for segment reporting purposes so long as certain aggregation criteria are met 
we define the codm as our chief executive officer 
as our business continues to mature  we assess how we view and operate our business 
based on the nature of our operations  we market a product that is basically the same product across our united states and international markets 
our codm assesses and reviews the company s performance and makes resource allocation decisions at the domestic and international levels 
in  we have identified two reportable segments the united states and the international business 
in  we only had one reportable business segment the united states  as we had no international operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates used  including those related to investments  long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets  including spectrum  share based compensation  and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
our accounting policies require management to make complex and subjective judgments 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
these factors could have a material impact on our financial statements  the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
in consultation with our board of directors  we have identified the following accounting policies that we believe are key to an understanding of our financial statements revenue recognition  impairments of long lived 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued assets  impairments of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  business combinations  share based compensation  accounting for spectrum licenses and leases  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  investments and fair value measurements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  which we refer to as sab  topic  revenue recognition  when all of the following conditions exist i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists in the form of an accepted purchase order  ii delivery has occurred  based on shipping terms  or services have been rendered  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  as documented on the accepted purchase order  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we primarily earn revenue by providing access to our wireless broadband network 
also included is revenue from the lease of cpe to customers and other additional services  including voip telephony service  personal and business email and static internet protocol 
activation fees are charged to customers when initiating a service subscription 
we apply emerging issues task force  which we refer to as eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to account for revenue arrangements with activation and or multiple service components 
these arrangements are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the relative fair values if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria 
we apply eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions 
when we are the primary obligor in a transaction  are subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  or have several but not all of these indicators  revenue is recorded gross 
if we are not the primary obligor and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage  a fixed payment schedule  or a combination of the two  we record the net amounts as commissions earned 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized 
our customer programs primarily involve promotional discounts on service fees for a specified period of time  which are designed to serve as sales incentives for our products in various target markets 
we account for promotional discounts in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  which we refer to as eitf no 
and  as such  the discount is treated as cash consideration and recorded as a reduction of revenue 
other promotions providing a free product or service from an unrelated entity are considered a deliverable in the exchange and not a refund or rebate of a portion of the service fees charged to the customer  and are treated as non cash consideration and are expensed as incurred in accordance with eitf no 
as opposed to a reduction in revenue 
service revenue from customers for the wireless broadband and optional services are billed in advance and recognized ratably over the service period 
activation fees charged to the customer are deferred and recognized as service revenue on a straight line basis over the expected life of the customer relationship  which we have estimated to be years for our pre wimax customers 
this expected life was determined based on our assessment of industry averages and our assessment of data on the duration of a customer life and average monthly churn 
revenue associated with the sale of cpe and other equipment to our customers is recognized when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
generally  the risks of ownership and title pass when product is delivered to our customer 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded to service revenue 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairments of long lived assets we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives  for recoverability whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of such long lived asset or group of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
such circumstances include  but are not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of the asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a current period loss combined with projections of continuing losses associated with use of the asset  a significant change in our business or technology strategy  such as a switch to mobile wimax wireless broadband network  a significant change in our management s views of growth rates for our business  and a significant change in the anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
we evaluate quarterly  or as needed  whether such events and circumstances have occurred 
when such events or circumstances exist  we would determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value by estimating the undiscounted future net cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the asset 
for purposes of recognition and measurement  we group our long lived assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss  if any  is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
as of december   our stock price was compared to our stock price on the date of the transactions of 
this market decline is deemed to be a triggering event under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requiring us to perform an impairment test 
we conducted the recoverability test and concluded there was no impairment 
impairments of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives we assess the impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually  or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of such asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  any of which could trigger an impairment review  include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we account for our intangible assets that have indefinite lives in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we refer to as sfas no 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the fair value is determined by estimating the discounted future cash flows that are directly associated with  and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of  the asset 
in accordance with sfas no 
 intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are assessed 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for impairment annually  or more frequently  if an event indicates that the asset might be impaired 
we had no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets in any of the periods presented 
business combinations we account for acquisitions occurring before january  using the purchase method in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  which we refer to as sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that the total purchase price be allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date  with amounts exceeding the fair value being recorded as goodwill 
if the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired  the difference is allocated to the eligible assets under sfas no 
the allocation process requires an analysis of acquired fixed assets  contracts  and contingencies to identify and allocate the excess of fair value over cost to the eligible assets acquired 
significant management judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired 
the fair value estimates are based on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management  but are inherently uncertain 
our allocation of the purchase price to specific assets and liabilities is based upon customary valuation procedures and techniques 
purchase transactions are subject to purchase price allocation adjustments due to contingency resolution for up to one year after close 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  which we refer to as sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we recognize compensation costs  net of a forfeiture rate  for those shares expected to vest on a graded vesting schedule over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term of four years 
going forward  stock based compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 
we issue incentive awards to our employees through stock based compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock units  which we refer to as rsus 
the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method  which in this case  is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of clearwire class a common stock on the date of grant 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes valuation model  which we refer to as bsm  to estimate the fair value of stock options which requires complex and judgmental assumptions including estimated stock price volatility and employee exercise patterns expected life of the option 
the computation of expected volatility is based on an average historical volatility from common shares of a group of our peers as well as our own volatility 
the expected life of options granted is based on the simplified calculation of expected life  described in sab no 
 share based payment  due to lack of option exercise history 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially for future grants as compared to the current period 
sfas no 
r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock options or rsus that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to stock based compensation expense may be required in future periods 
accounting for spectrum licenses and leases we have three types of arrangements for spectrum licenses in the united states owned spectrum licenses with indefinite lives  owned spectrum licenses with definitive lives and spectrum leases 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the owned licenses in the united states and internationally that have a track record of renewal are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but must be assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if an event indicates that the asset might be impaired 
owned licenses internationally that do not have a track record of renewal are accounted for as long lived assets and are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  as required by sfas no 
we account for the spectrum lease arrangements as executory contracts which are similar to operating leases 
for leases containing scheduled rent escalation clauses we record minimum rental payments on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  including the renewal periods as appropriate 
for leases involving significant up front payments  we account for such payments as prepaid spectrum lease costs 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our limited operating history  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income loss  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
as it relates to the us tax jurisdiction  we determined that our temporary taxable difference associated with our investment in clearwire communications llc will reverse within the reversal periods of its deferred tax assets and accordingly represents relevant future taxable income 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets  which was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
investments sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sab no 
 non current marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we classify marketable debt and equity securities that are available for current operations as short term available for sale investments  which are stated at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
losses are recognized when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
realized gains and losses are determined on the basis of the specific identification method 
we review our short term and long term investments on an ongoing basis for indicators of other than temporary impairment  and this determination requires significant judgment 
we have an investment portfolio comprised of us treasuries and auction rate securities 
the value of these securities is subject to market volatility for the period we hold these investments and until their sale or maturity 
we recognize realized losses when declines in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
in determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price when available  investment ratings  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued at the current estimated fair value and a realized loss equal to the decline is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in determining fair value  we use quoted prices in active markets where such prices are available  or we use models to estimate fair value using various methods including the market  income and cost approaches 
for investments where we use models to estimate fair value in the absence of quoted market prices  we often utilize certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the investment  including assumptions about risk and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs are readily observable  market corroborated  or unobservable company inputs 
we estimate the fair value of securities without quoted market prices using internally generated pricing models that require various inputs and assumptions 
we believe that our pricing models  inputs and assumptions are what market participants would use in pricing the securities 
we maximize the use of observable inputs to the pricing models where quoted market prices from securities and derivatives exchanges are available and reliable 
we typically receive external valuation information for us treasuries  other us government and agency securities  as well as certain corporate debt securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit 
we also use certain unobservable inputs that cannot be validated by reference to a readily observable market or exchange data and rely  to a certain extent  on management s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the security 
our internally generated pricing models may include our own data and require us to use our judgment in interpreting relevant market data  matters of uncertainty and matters that are inherently subjective in nature 
we use many factors that are necessary to estimate market values  including  interest rates  market risks  market spreads  and timing of cash flows  market liquidity  and review of underlying collateral and principal  interest and dividend payments 
the use of different judgments and assumptions could result in different presentations of pricing and security prices could change significantly based on market conditions 
fair value measurements during  we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which we refer to as sfas no 
 for our financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequently recurring basis 
these include our derivative instruments and our short term and long term investments 
as defined in sfas no 
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  we utilize certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated  or generally unobservable inputs 
we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques  we are required to provide the following information according to the fair value hierarchy level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
in accordance with sfas no 
and our policy  it is our practice to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
when available  we use quoted market prices to measure fair value 
if listed prices or quotes are not available  fair value is based on internally developed models that primarily use  as inputs  market based or independently sourced market parameters  including but not limited to interest rate yield curves  volatilities  equity or debt prices  and credit curves 
in estimating fair values  we utilize certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument  including assumptions about risk 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued value of a financial instrument is dependent on the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
for financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in addition  changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data 
in these instances  we use certain unobservable inputs that cannot be validated by reference to a readily observable market or exchange data and rely  to a certain extent  on management s own judgment about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the security 
these internally derived values are compared with non binding values received from brokers or other independent sources 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries results of operations within this results of operations section  we disclose results of operations on both an as reported and a pro forma basis 
the reported results are not necessarily representative of our ongoing operations as old clearwire s results are included only for the period of time after the november  closing 
prior to that date  the reported results reflect only the sprint wimax business results 
therefore  to facilitate an understanding of our trends and on going performance  we have presented pro forma results in addition to the reported results 
the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations were prepared in accordance with article pro forma financial information of securities and exchange commission regulation s x 
the pro forma results include both the sprint wimax business and old clearwire for and  as adjusted for certain pro forma purchase accounting adjustments and other non recurring charges  and give effect to the transactions as though the closing had occurred as of january  a reconciliation of pro forma amounts to reported amounts has been included under the heading pro forma reconciliation

as reported results year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated statements of operations in thousands  except per share data year ended december  revenues operating expenses cost of goods and services and network costs exclusive of items shown separately below selling  general and administrative expense depreciation and amortization spectrum lease expense transaction related expenses total operating expenses operating loss other income expense interest income interest expense foreign currency gains  net other than temporary impairment loss and realized loss on investments other income expense  net total other income expense  net loss before non controlling interests and income taxes non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries loss before income taxes income tax provision net loss net loss per clearwire class a common share basic diluted weighted average clearwire class a common shares outstanding 
table of contents year ended december  basic diluted prior to the closing  we had no equity as we were a wholly owned division of sprint 
as such  we did not calculate or present net loss per share for the period from january  to november  and the year ended december  we have calculated and presented basic and diluted net loss per share for the period from november  through december  revenue 
revenue is primarily generated from subscription and modem lease fees for our wireless broadband service  as well as from activation fees and fees for other services such as email  voip  and web hosting services 
year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change revenue   n m the increase in revenue for is primarily due to the revenue received from operations of clearwire following the closing of the transactions on november   where we acquired all of the old clearwire markets and subscribers 
revenue in the united states represented and international represented of total revenue for the year ended december  as of december   we operated our services in domestic and four international markets 
total subscribers in all markets were approximately  as of december  there were no subscribers as of december  we expect revenues to increase due to the roll out of new mobile wimax markets  which will increase our subscriber base  and an increase in service offerings in in addition  we expect that average revenue per user  which we refer to as arpu  will be similar to current levels because increases from multiple service offerings per customer will likely be offset by the impact of promotional pricing 
we expect that churn will increase in our pre wimax markets as we transition these networks to mobile wimax technology 
cost of goods and services and network costs 
cost of goods and services includes costs associated with tower rents  direct internet access and backhaul  which is the transporting of data traffic between distributed sites and a central point in the market or point of presence 
cost of goods and services also includes certain network equipment  site costs  facilities costs  software licensing and certain office equipment 
network costs primarily consist of external services and internal payroll incurred in connection with the design  development and construction of the network 
the external services include consulting fees  contractor fees and project based fees that are not capitalizable 
year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change cost of goods and services and network costs cost of goods and services and network costs increased million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in tower lease and backhaul expenses 
we expect costs of goods and services and network costs to increase significantly in as we expand our network 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which we refer to as sg a  include all of the following treasury services  human resources and other shared services that were provided by sprint prior to the closing  salaries and benefits  sales commissions  travel expenses and related facilities costs for the following personnel sales  marketing  network deployment  executive  finance and accounting  information technology  customer care  human resource and legal following the closing  network deployment expenses representing non capitalizable costs on network builds in markets prior to launch  rather than costs related to our markets after launch  which are included in cost of goods and services and network costs  and 
table of contents costs associated with advertising  trade shows  public relations  promotions and other market development programs and third party professional service fees 
year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change selling  general and administrative expense the increase is consistent with the additional resources  headcount and shared services that we have utilized as we continue to build and launch our mobile wimax services  especially the higher sales and marketing and customer care expenses in support of the launch of the baltimore market 
the increase in employee compensation and related costs  which includes facilities costs  is primarily due to the acquisition of old clearwire and all of its employees 
employee headcount increased at december  to approximately  employees compared to approximately employees at december  our focus in and will be on development and expansion of our wireless g network 
we expect that cost per gross addition  which we refer to as cpga  will increase as new markets are launched  consistent with our past operating experiences 
depreciation and amortization year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents the depreciation recorded on network assets that are being placed into service as we continue to build and develop our networks 
during the year ended december   substantially all of the capital expenditures represented construction work in progress and therefore very little depreciation was recorded 
in  assets were placed into service as they were available for use and have been depreciated accordingly 
the increase is also due to depreciation and amortization expense recorded on assets acquired from old clearwire for the period after the closing of the transactions on november  depreciation and amortization will increase as additional mobile wimax markets are launched and placed into service during spectrum lease expense year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change spectrum lease expense total spectrum lease expense increased as a direct result of a significant increase in the number of spectrum leases held by us as well as the acquisition of spectrum leases as part of the transactions 
with the significant number of new spectrum leases and the increasing cost of these leases  we expect our spectrum lease expense to increase 
as we renegotiate these leases  they are replaced with new leases  usually at a higher lease cost per month  but with longer terms 
many of the leases acquired as part of the transactions were entered into before and the periodic payments before january  were funded by sprint 
spectrum expense for these contracts was million and million in and  respectively 
transaction related expenses year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change transaction related expenses   n m transaction related expenses include a one time million settlement loss resulting from the termination of spectrum lease agreements in which sprint leased spectrum to old clearwire prior to the transactions 
before the closing  sprint leased spectrum to old clearwire through various spectrum lease agreements 
as part of the 
table of contents transactions  sprint contributed both the spectrum lease agreements and the spectrum assets underlying those agreements to our business 
as a result of the transactions  the spectrum lease agreements were effectively terminated  and the settlement of those agreements was accounted for as a separate element apart from the business combination 
the settlement loss recognized from the termination was valued based on the amount by which the agreements were favorable or unfavorable to our business as compared to current market rates 
interest expense year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change interest expense   n m the increase in interest expense was due to million of interest expense recorded on the note payable to sprint for the repayment of the sprint pre closing financing amount and the million of interest expense recorded on the long term debt acquired from old clearwire as part of the closing 
other than temporary impairment loss and realized loss on investments year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change other than temporary impairment loss and realized loss on investments  net   n m the increase in the other than temporary impairment loss and realized loss on investments is primarily due to a decline in the value of investment securities for the period following the closing  which we determined to be other than temporary 
during the year ended december   we incurred other than temporary impairment losses of million related to a decline in the estimated fair values of our investment securities 
tax provision year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change income tax provision the increase in the income tax provision is primarily due to increased deferred tax liabilities from additional amortization taken for federal income tax purposes by the sprint wimax business on certain indefinite lived licensed spectrum prior to the closing 
the sprint wimax business incurred significant deferred tax liabilities related to the spectrum licenses 
due to the indefinite lived nature of such intangible assets  we can not estimate the amount or timing  if any  of such deferred tax liabilities reversing in future periods 
accordingly  these deferred tax liabilities are not relevant future taxable income and their increase is not offset by a release of valuation allowance on our net operating losses 
the ongoing difference between book and tax amortization resulted in an additional deferred income tax provision of million in prior to the closing 
non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries   n m the non controlling interests in net loss represent the allocation of a portion of the net loss to the non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries based on the ownership by sprint and the investors  other than google  of clearwire communications class b common interests upon the closing

revenue is primarily generated from subscription and modem lease fees for our wireless broadband service  as well as from activation fees and fees for other services such as email  voip telephony  and web hosting services 

table of contents year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change revenue revenue in the united states represented and international represented of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to and for the year ended december   respectively 
total subscribers in all markets grew to approximately  as of december  actual from approximately  as of december  pro forma 
the growth in subscribers and the increase in services available to customers were the primary reasons for the increase in revenue when comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  we expect revenues to increase due to the roll out of new mobile wimax markets  which will increase our subscriber base  and an increase in service offerings in in addition  we expect that arpu will be similar to current levels because increases from multiple service offerings per customer  will likely be offset by the impact of promotional pricing 
we expect that churn will increase in our pre wimax markets as we transition these networks to mobile wimax technology 
cost of goods and services and network costs 
costs of goods and services and network costs primarily includes costs associated with tower rents  direct internet access and backhaul  as well as network related expenses 
cost of goods and services and network costs also includes certain network equipment  site costs  facilities costs  software licensing and certain office equipment 
year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change cost of goods and services and network costs the increase in cost of goods and services and network costs was primarily due to an increase in the number of towers  increases in direct internet access and related backhaul costs and additional expenses as we launched an additional market in and prepared for future mobile wimax builds from december  to december  we expect costs of goods and services and network costs to increase significantly in as we expand our network 
selling  general and administrative expense 
sg a includes all of the following treasury services  human resources and other shared services that were provided by sprint prior to the closing  salaries and benefits  sales commissions  travel expenses and related facilities costs for the following personnel sales  marketing  network deployment  executive  finance and accounting  information technology  customer care  human resource  network deployment expenses representing non capitalizable costs on network builds in markets prior to launch  rather than costs related to our markets after launch which is included in cost of goods and services and network costs  and costs associated with advertising  trade shows  public relations  promotions and other market development programs and third party professional service fees 
year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change selling  general and administrative expense the increase in sg a was due to additional costs related to the launch of mobile wimax services  which was offset by reductions in employee headcount and related expenses 
our employee headcount was approximately  at december  actual compared to approximately  employees at december  pro forma 
our focus in and will be on development and expansion of our wireless g network 
we expect that cpga will increase as new markets are launched  consistent with our past operating experiences 
depreciation and amortization year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change depreciation and amortization 
table of contents the increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation expense associated with our continued network build out and the depreciation of cpe related to associated subscriber growth 
the majority of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense relates to the development of our pre wimax network between and depreciation and amortization will increase as additional mobile wimax markets are launched and placed into service during spectrum lease expense year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change spectrum lease expense total spectrum lease expense increased as a direct result of a significant increase in the number of spectrum leases held by us as well as the acquisition of spectrum leases as part of the transactions 
with the significant number of spectrum leases and the increasing cost of these leases  we expect our spectrum lease expense to increase 
as we renegotiate these leases they are replaced with new leases  usually at a higher lease cost per month  but with longer terms 
many of the leases acquired as part of the transactions were entered into before and the periodic payments before january  were funded by sprint 
spectrum expense for these contracts was million and million in and  respectively 
interest income year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change interest income the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in interest rates earned on investments  as well as lower principal balances of short term and long term investments held during the year ended december  compared to other than temporary impairment loss and realized loss on investments year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change other than temporary impairment loss and realized loss on investments the increase in the other than temporary impairment loss and realized loss on investment securities is due to an increase in the decline in value of investment securities for the year ended december   which we determined to be other than temporary 
at december   we held available for sale short term and long term investments with a fair value and cost of billion 
during the year ended december   we incurred other than temporary impairment losses of million related to a decline in the estimated fair values of our investment securities 
non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries year ended december  dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages change change non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries the non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries represent the allocation of a portion of the net loss to the non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries based on the clearwire communications class b common interests ownership in clearwire communications

the following unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the years ended december  and were prepared under article pro forma financial information of securities and exchange commission regulation s x using the audited consolidated financial statements of clearwire for the years ended december  and  the audited consolidated financial statements of old clearwire for the year ended december   and the unaudited accounting records for the period january  to november  for old clearwire 
the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations should be read in conjunction with these separate historical financial statements and accompanying notes thereto

on closing  old clearwire and the sprint wimax business completed the combination to form clearwire 
the transactions are being accounted for under sfas no 
as a reverse acquisition with the sprint wimax business deemed to be the accounting acquirer 
on the closing  the investors made an aggregate billion capital contribution to clearwire and its subsidiary clearwire communications 
in exchange for their investment  google initially received  shares of clearwire class a common stock and sprint and the other investors received  shares of clearwire class b common stock and an equivalent amount of clearwire communications class b common interests 
the number of shares of clearwire class a and b common stock and clearwire communications class b common interests  as applicable  that the investors were entitled to receive under the transaction agreement was subject to a post closing adjustment based on the trading price of clearwire class a common stock on nasdaq over randomly selected trading days during the day period ending on the th day after the closing  or february   which we refer to as the adjustment date  with a floor of per share and a cap of per share 
during the measurement period  clearwire class a common stock traded below per share on nasdaq  so on the adjustment date  we issued to the investors an additional  shares of clearwire class a common stock and  shares of clearwire class b common stock and  additional clearwire communications class b common interests to reflect the final price per share 
additionally  in accordance with the subscription agreement  on february   cw investments purchased  shares of clearwire class a common stock at per share 
for the purpose of determining the number of shares outstanding within the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations  we assumed that the additional shares and common interests issued to the investors on the adjustment date  as applicable  were issue as of the closing and that the closing was consummated on january  after giving effect to the transactions  the post closing adjustment and the investment by cw investments of million  sprint owns the largest interest in clearwire with an effective voting and economic interest in clearwire and its subsidiaries of approximately 
in connection with the integration of the sprint wimax business and old clearwire operations  we expect that certain non recurring charges will be incurred 
we also expect that certain synergies might be realized due to operating efficiencies or future revenue synergies expected to result from the transactions 
however  the amount and extent of those synergies cannot be quantified at this time 
therefore  no pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro form combined statements of operations to reflect any such costs or benefits 
pro forma adjustments related to purchase accounting and other non recurring charges for the years ended december  and the pro forma adjustments related to purchase accounting have been derived from the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of old clearwire  including the allocation of the excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price 
the allocation of the purchase consideration is preliminary and based on valuations derived from estimated fair value assessments and assumptions used by management 
the final purchase price allocation is pending the finalization of appraisal valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired 
while management believes that its preliminary estimates and assumptions underlying the valuations are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in different values being assigned to individual assets acquired and liabilities 
table of contents assumed  and the resulting amount of the excess of estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price 
article of regulation s x requires that pro forma adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma statement of operations are directly related to the transaction for which pro forma financial information is presented and have a continuing impact on the results of operations 
certain charges have been excluded in the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations as such charges were incurred in direct connection with or at the time of the transactions and are not expected to have an ongoing impact on the results of operations after the closing 
a represents the accelerated vesting of stock options for certain members of management upon the closing  which resulted in a one time charge of approximately million recorded by old clearwire in its historical financial statements for the months ended november  as these are non recurring charges directly attributable to the transactions  they are excluded from the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended december  b the adjustments are to record depreciation and amortization expense on a pro forma basis related to the new basis of old clearwire property  plant and equipment in purchase accounting which are being depreciated and amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives on a straight line basis 
the reduction in depreciation results from a decrease in the carrying value of property  plant and equipment as a result of the allocation of the excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price 
c represents the adjustments to record amortization on a pro forma basis related to the new basis of the old clearwire spectrum lease contracts and other intangible assets over their estimated weighted average remaining useful lives on a straight line basis 
d represents the elimination of intercompany other income and related expenses associated with the historical agreements pre closing between the sprint wimax business and old clearwire  where old clearwire leased spectrum licenses from the sprint wimax business 
e represents the reversal of transaction costs of million for the year ended december   comprised of million of investment banking fees and million of other professional fees  recorded in the old clearwire historical financial statements for the year ended december  as these are non recurring charges directly attributable to the transactions  they are excluded from the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended december  f prior to the closing  sprint leased spectrum to old clearwire through various spectrum lease agreements 
as part of the transactions  sprint contributed both the spectrum lease agreements and the spectrum assets underlying those agreements 
as a result of the transactions  the spectrum lease agreements were effectively terminated  and the settlement of those agreements was accounted for as a separate element from the business combination 
a settlement loss of million resulted from the termination as the agreements were considered to be unfavorable to us relative to current market rates 
this one time charge recorded by clearwire at the closing is excluded from the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended december  g prior to the closing of the transactions  old clearwire refinanced the senior term loan facility and renegotiated the loan terms 
historical interest expense related to the senior term loan facility before the refinancing and amortization of the deferred financing fees recorded by old clearwire  in the amounts of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  have been reversed as if the transactions were consummated on january  additionally  the loss on extinguishment of debt of million recorded for the year ended december  was reversed in the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations 
h represents the adjustment to record pro forma interest expense assuming the senior term loan facility and the sprint tranche under the amended credit agreement were outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest period presented  january  the closing would have resulted in an event of default under the terms of the credit agreement underlying the senior term loan facility unless the consent of the 
table of contents lenders was obtained 
on november   old clearwire entered into the amended credit agreement with the lenders to satisfy this closing condition 
the amended credit agreement resulted in additional fees to be paid and adjustments to the underlying interest rates 
the sprint pre closing financing amount was assumed by clearwire on the closing as a result of the financing of the sprint wimax business by sprint for the period april  through the closing  and added as an additional tranche under the amended credit agreement 
pro forma interest expense was calculated over the period using the effective interest method resulting in an adjustment of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  based on an effective interest rate of percent 
pro forma interest expense also reflects an adjustment to accrete the debt to par value 
pro forma interest expense was calculated based on the contractual terms under the amended credit agreement  assuming a term equal to its contractual maturity of months and the underlying interest rate was the base rate of percent  as the month libor rate in effect at the closing was less than the base rate 
a one eighth percentage change in the interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
i represents the allocation of a portion of the pro forma combined net loss to the non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries based on sprint s and the investors other than google ownership of the clearwire communications class b common interests in clearwire communications upon closing and reflects the contributions by cw investments and the investors at per share following the post closing adjustment 
this adjustment is based on pre tax loss since income tax consequences associated with any loss allocated to the clearwire communications class b common interests will be incurred directly by the investors other than google and by sprint 
j represents the adjustment to reflect the pro forma income tax expense for each period which was determined by computing the pro forma effective tax rates for each period  giving effect to the transactions 
clearwire expects to generate net operating losses into the foreseeable future and thus has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets not expected to be realized 
therefore  for the years ended december  and  no tax benefit was recognized 
liquidity and capital resource requirements at the closing  we received an aggregate of billion of cash proceeds from the investors 
we expect the cash proceeds from this investment to primarily be used to expand our mobile wimax network in the united states  for spectrum acquisitions  and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   with the proceeds of the investment  we believe that we held sufficient cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to cause our estimated liquidity needs to be satisfied for at least months 
to execute our plans  we will likely seek additional capital in the near future and over the long term 
any additional debt financing would increase our future financial commitments  while any additional equity financing would be dilutive to our stockholders 
this additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including our market success as we deploy new mobile wimax markets  general economic conditions and the state of the capital markets  our future creditworthiness and restrictions contained in existing or future debt agreements 
we regularly evaluate our plans and strategy  and these evaluations often result in changes  some of which may be material and may significantly increase or decrease our cash requirements 
changes in our plans and strategy may include  among other things  changes to the extent and timing of our network deployment  increases or decreases in the number of our employees  introduction of new features or services  investments in capital and network infrastructure  acquisitions of spectrum or any combination of the foregoing 
in addition  recent distress in the financial markets has resulted in extreme volatility in security prices  diminished liquidity and credit availability and declining valuations of certain investments 
other than the impairment of our auction rate securities  we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined that there has not been a significant impact to our financial position or liquidity during if the national or global economy or credit market conditions in general were to deteriorate further in the future  it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our cash flows through increased interest costs or our 
table of contents ability to obtain additional external financing 
the effects of these changes could also require us to make material changes to our current plans and strategy 
cash flow analysis the following analysis includes the results of operations for the sprint wimax business for the first eleven months of prior to the closing of the transactions and the results of operations for clearwire subsequent to the closing of the transactions on november  the operations data represents the sprint wimax business historical results of operations 
the statement of cash flows includes the activities that were paid by sprint on behalf of us prior to the closing of the transactions 
financing activities include funding advances from sprint through november  further  the net cash used in operating activities and the net cash used in investing activities for capital expenditures and acquisitions of spectrum licenses and patents represent transfers of expenses or assets paid for by other sprint subsidiaries

this is partially offset by million in cash received from customers 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  investing activities during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was billion 
the net cash used in investing activities is due primarily to billion in purchases of available for sale securities following the billion cash investment from the investors  million in cash paid for property  plant and equipment and million in payments for acquisition of spectrum licenses and other intangibles 
these uses of cash are partially offset by million of cash acquired from old clearwire as a result of the transactions 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
the net cash used in investing activities is due to million in payments for acquisition of spectrum licenses and other intangibles and million in cash paid for property  plant and equipment 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was billion for the year ended december  this is primarily due to billion of cash received from the investors  million pre transaction funding from sprint and million from the sprint pre closing financing amount  up through the closing 
these are partially 
table of contents offset by million paid to to sprint for partial reimbursement of the pre closing financing  a million debt financing fee and a million payment on our senior term loan facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was billion for the year ended december  this was due to advances from sprint 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments as of december  changes in our business needs or interest rates  as well as actions by third parties and other factors  may cause these estimates to change 
because these estimates are complex and necessarily subjective  our actual payments in future periods are likely to vary from those presented in the table 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations including principal and interest payments under our debt obligations  payments under our spectrum lease obligations  and other contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than contractual obligations total year years years over years long term debt obligations interest payments operating lease obligations spectrum lease obligations other contractual obligations total our interest payment obligations are estimated for all years using an interest rate of approximately  based on our expected interest rate through the term of the loan 
includes agreements to purchase equipment and installation services  backhaul and other goods and services from suppliers with take or pay obligations 
we do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of investments 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate risk is associated with our senior term loan facility assumed at fair value as part of the closing in the amount of billion  net of discount  and the sprint tranche entered into on december   related to the reimbursement of million of the sprint pre closing financing amount 
we have a total outstanding principal balance of billion  with a carrying value and an approximate fair market value of billion at december  the rate of interest for borrowings under the senior term loan facility is the libor base rate plus a margin of  which base rate shall be no lower than per annum or the alternate base rate  which is equal to the greater of a the prime rate or b the federal funds effective rate plus of  plus a margin of  which base rate shall be no lower than per annum 
these margin rates increase by basis points on each of the sixth  twelfth  and eighteen month anniversaries of the closing 
at our option  the accrued interest resulting from the margin increases will be payable in cash or payable in kind by capitalizing the additional interest and adding it to the outstanding principal amount of the senior term loan facility 
on the second anniversary of the closing  for libor based loans  the applicable margin rate will increase to per annum and for alternate base rate loans the applicable margin rate will increase to per annum 
interest is payable quarterly with respect to alternate base rate loans  and with respect to libor based loans  interest is payable in arrears at the end of each applicable period  but at least every three months 
in addition  on the second anniversary of the closing  we are required to pay an amount equal to of the outstanding principal balance of the senior term loan facility 
this fee will be paid in kind by capitalizing the amount of the fee and adding it to the outstanding principal amount of the senior term loan facility 
the current interest rate on our senior term loan facility was at december  our semi variable interest rate has a libor floor of 
a one percent increase above the floor would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million per year 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as it relates to our international operations 
we currently do not hedge our currency exchange rate risk and  as such  we are exposed to fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies 
our international subsidiaries and equity investees generally use the currency of the jurisdiction in which they reside  or local currency  as their functional currency 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and the resulting translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the reporting period 
the effects of changes in exchange rates between the designated functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains losses and recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we believe that the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
investment risk at december   we held available for sale short term and long term investments with a fair value of billion and a cost of billion  of which investments with a fair value and cost of million were auction rate securities and investments with a fair value and a cost of billion were us government and agency issues 
we regularly review the carrying value of our short term and long term investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary 
the estimated fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the credit markets in general  company specific circumstances  changes in general economic conditions and use of management judgment when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available 
auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are normally reset approximately every or days through an auction process 
our investments in auction rate securities represent interests in collateralized debt obligations  which we refer to as cdos  supported by preferred equity securities of insurance companies and financial institutions with stated final maturity dates in and the total fair value and cost of our security interests in cdos as of december  was million 
we also own auction rate securities that are auction market preferred securities issued by a monoline insurance company and these securities are perpetual and do not have a final stated maturity 
the total fair value and cost of our auction market preferred securities as of december  was million 
these securities were rated bbb or ba by standard poor s or moody s rating services  respectively  at december  current market conditions are such that we are unable to estimate when the auctions will resume 
as a result  our auction rate securities are classified as long term investments 
derivative instruments as part of the closing of the transactions  we assumed two interest rate swap contracts that were entered into by old clearwire 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we did not designate these swap agreements as cash flow hedges as of december  we are not holding these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes and continue to hold these derivatives to offset our exposure to interest rate risk 
the following table sets forth information regarding our interest rate derivative contracts as of december  in thousands type of notional maturity receive pay fair market derivative amount date index rate fixed rate value swap  month libor  swap  month libor  in addition  we are exposed to certain losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties under the interest rate derivative contracts 
we expect the counterparties  which are major financial institutions  to perform fully under these contracts 
however  if the counterparties were to default on their obligations under the interest rate 
table of contents derivative contracts  we could be required to pay the full rates on our debt  even if such rates were in excess of the rates in the interest rate swap contracts
