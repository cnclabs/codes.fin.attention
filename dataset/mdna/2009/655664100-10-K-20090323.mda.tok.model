competitive conditions our business is highly competitive

risk factors 
dollars in millions our business faces many risks 
we believe the risks described below outline the items of most concern to us 
however  these risks are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
deterioriation of economic conditions the recent deterioration in economic conditions has hurt our business in several ways 
instability in the stock market  tightening of consumer credit and the recent decline in the housing market in the united states has caused a reduction in consumer spending 
this has had a significant negative impact on our revenues 
we sell high quality apparel  shoes  cosmetics and accessories  which many consumers consider to be discretionary items 
during economic downturns  fewer customers may shop in our stores and on our web site  and those who do shop may limit the amount of their purchases  all of which may lead to higher markdowns and increased marketing and promotional spending in response to lower demand 
the deterioration of economic conditions has also adversely affected our credit customers payment patterns and default rates  increasing our bad debt expense 
we do not expect that economic conditions are likely to improve significantly in the near future  and a continuation or worsening of the credit crisis  or even the fear of such a development  could continue to harm our business 
ability to respond to the business environment and fashion trends our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences quickly  and to match our merchandise mix to consumer tastes  impacts our sales and operating results 
if we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences quickly enough  we may be forced to sell our merchandise at higher average markdown levels and lower average margins  which could harm our business 
in addition  many factors outside of our control  including consumer confidence  weather and other hazards of nature that affect consumer traffic  and general economic conditions could decrease consumer spending at our stores 
brand and reputation we have a well recognized brand that many customers believe offers a high level of customer service and quality merchandise 
any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales  reduce employee morale and productivity  and diminish customer trust  any of which would harm our business 
inventory management we strive to ensure the merchandise we offer remains fresh and compelling to our customers 
we make decisions regarding inventory purchases well in advance of the season in which it will be sold 
if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases  we may have excess inventory  which would result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance 
this could have an adverse effect on margins and net earnings 
conversely  if we fail to purchase enough merchandise  we may not have an adequate supply of products to meet our customers demand 
this may cause us to lose sales or harm our customer relationships 
capital management and liquidity our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long term returns 
this includes spending on inventory  capital projects and expenses  managing debt levels  managing accounts receivable through our credit business and returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
to a large degree  capital management and liquidity reflects how well we manage our other key risks 
the actions we take to address other specific risks could affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital management and liquidity 
if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns  our business may suffer 
impact of competitive market forces the retail industry environment continues to change for many of our vendors and customers 
in the future  our competition may partner more effectively with vendors to serve consumers needs 
if we do not effectively respond to changes in our environment  we may see a loss of market share to competitors  declining sales and declining profitability due to higher markdowns 
store growth plan our five year strategic growth plan includes opening several new full line and rack stores  with announced store openings through we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores 
local land use and other regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations 
new store openings also involve certain risks  including constructing  furnishing and supplying a store in a timely and cost effective manner and accurately assessing the demographic or retail environment for a particular location 
our future sales at new  relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections  which could affect our return on investment 
performance in our new stores could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to hire employees who are able to deliver the level of service our customers have come to expect when shopping in our stores 
our expected opening dates have sometimes been delayed because of developer plan delays 
if these developer plan delays continue or worsen  they could have a negative impact on profitability 
our inability to execute our store growth strategy in a way that generates appropriate returns on investment could affect our future growth and profitability 

table of contents consumer credit our credit card operations drive sales in our stores  allow our stores to avoid third party transaction fees and generate additional revenues by extending credit 
our credit card revenue is subject to changes in interest rates which fluctuate based on market conditions 
the market conditions influencing interest rates are based on economic factors that are beyond our control and include  but are not limited to  recession  inflation  deflation  consumer credit availability  consumer debt levels  tax rates and policy  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
our ability to extend credit to our customers and to collect payments from them depends on many factors including compliance with applicable laws and regulations  any of which may change from time to time 
changes in credit card use  payment patterns and default rates have resulted from a variety of economic  legal  social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty 
changes that impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments have negatively affected our results and may continue in the future 
availability and cost of credit us and global credit and equity markets have recently undergone significant disruption  making it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all 
as a result of this disruption  we have experienced an increase in the cost of borrowings necessary to operate our business 
if these conditions continue or become worse  our cost of borrowing could continue to increase 
it may also become more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or to refinance long term obligations as they become payable 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be affected by independent rating agencies short and long term debt ratings which are based largely on our performance as measured by credit metrics including interest coverage and leverage ratios 
a decrease in these ratings would likely also increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 
a significant increase in the costs we incur in order to finance our operations may have a material adverse impact on our business results and financial condition 
supply chain disruption we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend on independent third parties to manufacture our merchandise 
we may experience operational difficulties with our vendors  such as the availability of production capacity  errors in meeting merchandise specifications  insufficient quality control  failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs 
a vendor s failure to ship merchandise to us on a timely basis or to meet the required quality standards could cause supply shortages and could result in lost sales 
we depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process  which depends  in turn  on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of our six distribution centers and our direct fulfillment center 
we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient 
however  unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires  hurricanes or other catastrophic events  labor disagreements or shipping problems  may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores or our customers and could increase our costs 
although we maintain business interruption and property insurance  if any of the distribution centers or our fulfillment center is shut down for any reason  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient or we may not receive insurance proceeds in a timely manner 
relationship with vendors and developers our relationships with our vendors and developers have been a significant contributor to our past success and our position as a retailer of high quality and fashion merchandise 
some of our vendors and developers have experienced serious cash flow problems due to the credit market crisis 
in addition  the recent economic deterioration has reduced the availability of funds for vendors and developers 
we depend on the work of our developer partners to be able to sustain our store growth plan 
in the case of developer delays of shopping center expansion  renovation or construction projects or developer bankruptcies  our expected store openings or remodels could be further delayed or cancelled  and maintenance and leasing at some shopping centers in which we have stores could be adversely affected 
many of our key vendors limit the number of retail channels they use to sell their merchandise and competition to obtain and sell those goods is intense 
nearly all the brands of our top vendors are sold by competing retailers  and many of our top vendors also have their own dedicated retail stores 
if one or more of our top vendors were to increase sales of merchandise through their own stores or to the stores of our competitors  our business could be adversely affected 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our principal merchandising sources 
to counteract cash flow problems  our vendors could attempt to increase their prices  pass through increased costs  alter payment terms or seek other relief 
accordingly there can be no assurance that our vendors will continue to meet our quality  style or volume requirements 
our vendors may be forced to reduce their operations or file for bankruptcy protection  which in some cases would make it difficult for us to serve the market s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
geographic location of stores a significant amount of our total sales are derived from stores located on the west and east coasts  particularly california  which increases our dependence on local economic conditions within these states 
the success of our credit card business is also highly dependent on our customers ability to pay and our ability to minimize risk when extending credit to cardholders 
deterioration in economic conditions and consumer confidence within these states has negatively impacted our business  including a reduction in overall sales  reduced gross margins and increased expenses including bad debt expense 
these trends could become worse if these factors continue 
leadership development and succession planning the training and development of our future leaders is important to our long term growth 
if we do not effectively implement our strategic and business planning processes to train and develop future leaders  our long term growth may suffer 
we rely on the experience of our senior management  who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace 
if unexpected leadership turnover occurs without adequate succession plans  the loss of the services of any of these individuals  or any negative perceptions of our business as a result of those losses  could damage our brand image and our business 
our operations could be adversely affected if we cannot attract and retain qualified key personnel 
nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries 
table of contents employment laws and regulations our policies and procedures are designed to comply with human resource laws  employment laws and discrimination laws set forth by the federal government and in each of the states and municipalities where we do business 
human resource laws include regulations related to wage and hour  meal and rest period  and commissions 
wage and hour laws are complex  and the related enforcement is increasingly aggressive  particularly in the state of california 
employment and discrimination laws continue to evolve  making ongoing compliance in this area a challenge 
failure to comply with these laws may result in damage to our reputation  class action lawsuits  legal and settlement costs  disruption of our business  and loss of customers and employees  which would result in a loss of sales  increased employment costs  low employee morale  and harm to our business and results of operations 
information security and privacy the protection of our customer  employee and company data is important to us 
the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding  with new and constantly changing requirements across our business units 
in addition  our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information 
a significant breach of customer  employee or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales  fines and lawsuits 
information technology strategy we make investments in information technology to sustain our competitive position 
for  we expect to spend approximately on information technology operations and system development  which is key to our growth 
we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace 
targeting the wrong opportunities  failing to make the best investments  or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs may result in the loss of our competitive position 
in addition  if we do not maintain our current systems we may see interruptions to our business and increase our costs in order to bring our systems up to date 
we may implement too much technology  or change too fast  which could result in failure to adopt the new technology if we are not ready or capable of accepting it 
excessive technological change impacts the effectiveness of adoption  and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology 
however  not implementing new technologies can also compromise our competitive position 
if we are unable to strike the appropriate balance in the pace of our adoption of new technology  our business may suffer 
regulatory compliance our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including those imposed by the sec  nyse  the banking industry and foreign countries 
additional legal and regulatory requirements and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws  have increased the complexity of the regulatory environment and the cost of compliance 
failure to comply with the various regulations may result in damage to our reputation  civil and criminal liability  fines and penalties  increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements 
multi channel strategy execution over the past several years  we have made changes in our direct business that better align our online shopping environment with the customer experience in our full line stores 
these changes included aligning our direct merchandise offering with our full line stores to create a seamless experience for our customers between our stores and web site  linking the full line stores and direct merchandise organizations  reducing the number and frequency of our direct catalog mailings  and transitioning our direct inventory system onto our full line store platform 
our inability to continue to successfully execute this strategy could impact our future operating performance 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature 
due to our anniversary sale in july and the holidays in december  sales are higher for our retail stores and direct segment in the second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year than in the first and third quarters 
accordingly  our results may vary considerably from quarter to quarter 
in addition  we have significant additional cash requirements in the period leading up to the months of november and december in anticipation of higher sales volume in those months  including expenses for additional inventory  advertising and employees 
foreign currency we purchase a portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers whose cost to us is affected by fluctuations of their local currency against the us dollar or who price their merchandise in currencies other than the us dollar 
we purchase goods from many countries and are affected by changes in numerous currencies as well as fluctuations in the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold  and if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers  our gross margins  and ultimately our earnings  would decrease 
foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations in the future 
anti takeover provisions we are incorporated in the state of washington and subject to washington state law 
some provisions of washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us 
for example  one provision prohibits us  except under specified circumstances  from engaging in any significant business transaction with any shareholder who owns or more of our common stock an acquiring person for a period of five years following the time that the shareholder became an acquiring person

results of operations overview the business environment during was both challenging and volatile 
the first half of the year was relatively stable with quarterly same store sales decreasing between and 
the second half of was more volatile as consumers reduced their discretionary spending due to economic concerns and uncertainty  and retailers struggled to align their businesses with significantly lower levels of demand 
as a result  our quarterly same store sales in the second half of declined between and and our gross profit was negatively impacted

while we believe our model adjusts well to changing market trends  we took additional actions on expenses  working capital and planned capital expenditures to further mitigate operating margin pressure  improve operating cash flow and maintain a healthy balance sheet 
we ended the fiscal year with inventory levels aligned with current sales trends 
we followed a disciplined approach to finding and executing expense reduction opportunities and will continue these efforts through given the current economic conditions  our capital expenditures in will be significantly reduced compared to our plan last year 
these changes include reducing the number of major full line store remodels from approximately six per year to approximately two per year 
additionally  the economic environment has affected our real estate development partners  who have delayed or canceled several of our planned new full line stores 
we are continuously monitoring our capital expenditure plans as economic conditions change 
although we have reduced our planned capital expenditures overall  we did not reduce our maintenance expenditures budget  as it is important that we maintain the look  feel and experience of shopping in our stores 
overall  we believe we are well positioned to weather the economic downturn  while maintaining an unwavering focus on our customers and positioning the company for the future

gross profit rate is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales 
inventory turnover rate is calculated as annual cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs for all segments divided by quarter average inventory 
vs gross profit gross profit dollars decreased from last year while our gross profit rate declined basis points 
our gross profit rate is made up of both merchandise margin rates and buying and occupancy cost rate 
the deterioration for the year was driven primarily by a decrease in our merchandise margin rate as we utilized markdowns to respond to slower sales and a more competitive environment 
all major merchandise categories at our full line stores contributed to this decrease 
our buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales increased basis points as many of these costs are fixed relative to the sales decline 
our average inventory turnover improved slightly over last year while our average inventory per square foot decreased compared to the prior year 
our merchants efforts to align inventory levels to lower demand resulted in the improvement in our inventory turnover rate and our lower inventory per square foot 
our objective is to match the change in inventory per square foot  which declined on average  with our same store sales rate  which declined for the year 
vs gross profit our gross profit rate in was consistent with during we experienced increasing inventory levels coupled with slower sales trends 
to realign our inventory levels  we took higher markdowns during the last half of the year 
the increase in markdowns was offset by a decrease in our buying and occupancy costs  which declined due to lower performance based incentives and from the sale of our fa onnable business in the increase in our average inventory per square foot in compared with supported the growth of our designer business in apparel  accessories and shoes 
although we encountered softer sales trends during the latter half of  inventory discipline and growth in sales throughout the year resulted in improvement in our inventory turnover rate  which increased 
forecast of gross profit in  we expect a to basis point decrease in our gross profit rate 
although we begin with a good inventory position  we expect continued gross margin pressure as a result of competitive pressure and lower levels of customer demand 
we will also incur additional occupancy expense for the three new full line stores and ten new rack stores in nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries

during  we opened eight new full line stores and six new rack stores  which contributed of additional expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased basis points 
the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to the fixed nature of many of our selling  general and administrative expenses and the impact of declining sales 
vs selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively flat in compared with the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to decreases in our incentive costs tied to company performance 
forecast of selling  general and administrative expenses in  our selling  general and administrative dollars are expected to decrease to  dependent on our sales performance in we anticipate our variable expense model to continue to adjust to sales trends 
additionally  continuing to manage headcount to our business  as well as targeted reductions in merit based salary awards  discretionary spending and marketing and technology will reduce our fixed expenses 
we expect of additional selling  general and administrative expenses from new stores  which will partially offset the reduction in fixed and variable expenses

table of contents credit segment the nordstrom credit card products are designed to grow retail sales and customer relationships by providing superior payment products  services and loyalty benefits 
we believe that owning our credit card business allows us to fully integrate our rewards program with our retail stores and provide superior service and experience to our customers  thus deepening our relationship with customers and driving higher levels of long term customer loyalty 
each card enables participation in the nordstrom fashion rewards program  through which the customer accumulates points based on their level of spending two points per dollar spent at nordstrom and one point per dollar spent outside of nordstrom stores 
upon reaching two thousand points  customers receive twenty dollars in nordstrom notes  which can be redeemed for goods or services in our stores 
as customers increase their level of spending they receive additional benefits  including rewards such as complimentary shipping and alterations in our retail stores 
we believe the fashion rewards program  including these additional rewards  drives sales in our retail stores and direct segments 
the table below illustrates a detailed view of the operational results of our credit segment  consistent with the segment disclosure provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to view the total economic contribution of our credit card program  the following items are also included in the table below during  we combined our nordstrom private label credit card and nordstrom visa credit card programs into one securitization program

intercompany merchant fees represents the estimated intercompany income of our credit business from the usage of our cards in the retail stores and direct segments 
to encourage the use of nordstrom cards in our stores  the credit segment does not charge the retail stores and direct segments an interchange merchant fee

the majority of our credit accounts have finance charge rates that vary with changes in the prime rate 
interchange fees are earned from the use of nordstrom visa cards at merchants outside of nordstrom 
credit card revenues increased from in to in in part due to the nordstrom visa portfolio being on balance sheet for a full year in fiscal compared to only three quarters in fiscal  as well as overall portfolio growth 
during the first three quarters of fiscal  the positive impact we saw on finance charge revenue as a result of portfolio growth was partially offset by a significant reduction in the average prime rate as most of our nordstrom private label and visa cards have annual percentage rate terms that are tied to the prime rate 
however  during the fourth quarter of  finance charge revenues improved slightly due to a change in our credit card pricing terms effective november  the increase in credit card revenues from in to in is due to bringing the nordstrom visa portfolio on balance sheet as of may   as well as portfolio growth year over year

as a means of assigning comparable cost of capital for our credit card business  we believe it is important to maintain a capital structure similar to other financial institutions

we believe that debt equal to of our credit card receivables is appropriate given our overall capital structure goals

when read in conjunction with our net earnings and total assets and compared to return on assets  it provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period 
over the past several years  we have incorporated roic into our key financial metrics  and since have used it as an executive incentive measure 
our research has shown historically that overall performance as measured by roic correlates directly to shareholders return over the long term 
for the fiscal months ended january   our roic decreased to compared to for the fiscal months ended february  roic is not a measure of financial performance under united states gaap and should not be considered a substitute for return on assets  net earnings or total assets as determined in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

the increase in average invested capital compared to the prior year is primarily due to the securitization transaction on may   which brought the entire portfolio of nordstrom visa credit card receivables on balance sheet as of that date

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources reflects the effects of the correction discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
we maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and to minimize our need for short term borrowings 
we believe that our operating cash flows and available credit facilities are sufficient to finance our cash requirements for the next months 
over the long term  we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return  strengthen our financial position and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives 
we continuously assess our debt and leverage levels  capital expenditure requirements  principal debt payments  dividend payouts  potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions 
we believe our operating cash flows and available credit facilities  as well as any potential future borrowing facilities  will be sufficient to fund these scheduled future payments and potential long term initiatives 
in cash decreased by to as of january  the decrease was driven by capital expenditures of  returns to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock totaling  and purchases made by our customers for third party merchandise and services using nordstrom visa credit cards of these decreases were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of operating activities the majority of our operating cash inflows are related to sales to our customers  including the collection of accounts receivable 
we also receive cash payments for property incentives from developers 
our operating cash outflows generally consist of payments to our inventory vendors net of vendor allowances  payments to our employees for wages  salaries and other employee benefits  and payments to our landlords for rent 
operating cash outflows also include payments for income taxes and interest payments on our short and long term borrowings 
vs operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased from in to in in  the conversion of our nordstrom visa credit card receivables into an on balance sheet securitization program reduced cash provided by operating activities by as a result of this transaction  we recorded the nordstrom visa credit card receivables on our consolidated balance sheet and eliminated our investment in asset backed securities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared with was also due to lower variable expenses  fixed cost reductions and a decrease in cash paid for taxes in these increases were offset by the impact of declining sales in as well as an increase in cash paid for interest 
forecast of operating activities in  we expect our operating cash flows to decline as a result of lower sales 
investing activities our investing cash flows typically consist of capital expenditures and  beginning in the second quarter of  customer purchases net of payments for goods and services outside of nordstrom using the nordstrom visa credit cards 
vs investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased to in  primarily due to an increase in third party purchases using the nordstrom visa credit cards and an increase in capital expenditures 
additionally  the sale of our fa onnable business in partially offset investing cash outflows in the prior year 
in  we experienced growth in our nordstrom visa credit receivables related to purchases made by our customers for merchandise and services outside of nordstrom 
this drove an increase in cash used for accounts receivable originated at third parties  which was in compared with in the nordstrom visa credit cards enable our customers to purchase at merchants outside of nordstrom and accumulate points for our nordstrom fashion rewards program two points per dollar spent at nordstrom and one point per dollar spent outside of nordstrom stores 
upon reaching two thousand points  customers receive twenty dollars in nordstrom notes  which can be redeemed for goods or services in our stores 
we believe participation in the fashion rewards program has resulted in beneficial shifts in customer spending patterns and incremental sales in our stores 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures over the last three years totaled  with in  in and in with these capital expenditures  we added stores  enhanced existing facilities and improved our information systems 
the largest components of these expenditures were for new or relocated stores and store remodels 
we also received property incentives from our developers of in  in and in these incentives are included in our cash provided by operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows  however operationally we view these as an offset to our capital expenditures

with these changes  we delayed two planned store openings originally planned for to date in  we have relocated one full line store and opened two new rack stores 
during the remainder of  we anticipate opening three new full line stores and eight additional new rack stores 
we expect that our capital expenditures net of property incentives will be approximately  over the next five years  with approximately planned for over these five years  we plan to use of this investment to build new and relocated stores  on remodels major and minor  on information technology and for other projects 
our current five year plans include new stores announced through  which represents an increase in square footage 
almost half of these stores will be in the northeast and south 
we have also reduced the number of major full line store remodels from approximately six per year to approximately two per year

in determining the amount of dividends to pay  we analyze our dividend payout ratio and dividend yield  and balance the dividend payment with our operating performance and capital resources 
for the dividend yield  which is calculated as our dividends per share divided by our stock price  we plan to target a to long term yield 
we will balance any potential future dividend changes with our operating performance and available capital resources 
in february  we declared a first quarter dividend of per share  which is consistent with share repurchases our reported results for include in share repurchases 
during we repurchased shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  at an average price per share of

under the terms of the commercial paper agreement  we pay a rate of interest based on  among other factors  the maturity of the issuance and market conditions 
our unsecured line of credit expires in november we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission 
under the terms of the registration statement  and subject to the filing of certain post effective amendments  we are authorized to issue an unlimited principal amount of debt securities 
we are continuing to monitor the credit markets to determine the best time to refinance with long term debt 
our next debt maturity is a securitized note due in april debt covenants our borrowing facilities include restrictive covenants  including the following significant restrictions facility description of covenant a variable funding note standard and poor s bb and moody s ba ratings or better variable funding note standard and poor s bb and moody s ba ratings or better commercial paper unsecured line of credit leverage ratio adjusted debt to ebitdar not greater than approximately four times as of january  and february  we were in compliance with these covenants 
we will monitor each of these covenants closely in to ensure that we make any necessary adjustments to our plans and believe that we will remain in compliance with this covenant during see additional disclosure of adjusted debt to ebitdar on the following page

table of contents adjusted debt to ebitdar non gaap financial measure we define adjusted debt to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ebitdar as follows adjusted debt to ebitdar adjusted debt earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ebitdar numerator adjusted debt denominator ebitdar debt net earnings rent expense x income tax expense adjusted debt interest expense  net depreciation and amortization of buildings and equipment rent expense ebitdar adjusted debt to ebitdar is one of our key financial metrics and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure 
our goal today is to manage debt levels at a point which we believe will help us maintain an investment grade credit rating as well as operate with an efficient capital structure for our size  growth plans and industry 
investment grade credit ratings are important to maintaining access to a variety of short term and long term sources of funding  and we rely on these funding sources to continue to grow our business 
we believe a higher ratio  among other factors  could result in rating agency downgrades 
in contrast  we believe a lower ratio would result in a higher cost of capital and could negatively impact shareholder returns 
as of january   our adjusted debt to ebitdar was compared to at the end of the increase was the result of a decrease in ebitdar in compared with  driven primarily by a reduction in net earnings from in to in adjusted debt to ebitdar is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for debt to net earnings  net earnings or debt as determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  adjusted debt to ebitdar does have limitations adjusted debt is our best estimate of the total company debt we would incur if we had purchased the property associated with our operating leases 
ebitdar does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  including leases  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt 
other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted debt to ebitdar differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
to compensate for these limitations  we analyze adjusted debt to ebitdar in conjunction with other gaap financial and performance measures impacting liquidity  including operating cash flows  capital spending and net earnings see our adjusted debt to ebitdar reconciliation to gaap below 
the closest gaap measure is debt to net earnings  which was and for and  respectively 
the following is a reconciliation of debt to net earnings and adjusted debt to ebitdar debt add rent expense x adjusted debt net earnings add income tax expense add interest expense  net earnings before interest and income taxes add depreciation and amortization of buildings and equipment add rent expense ebitdar debt to net earnings adjusted debt to ebitdar the components of adjusted debt are as of the end of and  while the components of ebitdar are for the months ended january  and february  debt includes of outstanding commercial paper borrowings as of january  there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of february  the multiple of eight times rent expense used to calculate adjusted debt is our best estimate of the debt we would record for our leases which are classified as operating  if they had met criteria for a capital lease  or if we had purchased the property 
the decrease in rent expense is primarily due to the sale of our fa onnable business in the third quarter of nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries 
table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows as of january  we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and credit available to us under existing and potential future facilities 
less than more than total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations other long term liabilities operating leases purchase obligations total included in the required debt repayments disclosed above are estimated total interest payments of  as of january   payable over the remaining life of the debts 
other long term liabilities consist of workers compensation and general liability insurance reserves  postretirement benefits and a portion of our financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin reserves 
the repayment amounts presented above were determined based on historical payment trends 
we expect to pay of uncertain tax positions under fin in the next months and include this balance in other long term liabilities as due in less than one year 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows for the remaining fin balance and have excluded this from the table above 
other long term liabilities not requiring cash payments  such as deferred property incentives and deferred revenue  were excluded from the table above 
purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for unreceived goods or services and capital expenditure commitments 
this table also excludes the short term liabilities  other than the current portion of long term debt  disclosed on our consolidated balance sheet  as the amounts recorded for these items will be paid in the next year 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the estimates we feel are critical and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures that follow 
inventory our merchandise inventories are primarily stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory 
to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down  we consider current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions  our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin 
among others  the significant estimates used in inventory valuation are obsolescence and shrinkage 
we reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of net sales for the period from the most recent semi annual inventory count based on historical shrinkage results 
therefore  our obsolescence reserve and shrinkage percentage contain uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including market conditions  the selling environment  historical results and current inventory trends 
management does not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience 
in prior years  we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of the obsolescence and shrinkage reserves 
we do not believe a change in the obsolescence reserve or our shrink percentage would have a material effect on our net earnings 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues net of estimated returns and we exclude sales taxes 
our retail stores record revenue at the point of sale 
our catalog and online sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon estimated delivery to the customer 
as part of the normal sales cycle  we receive customer merchandise returns 
to recognize the financial impact of sales returns  we estimate the amount of goods that will be returned and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly 
inherent in establishing and maintaining a sales return reserve are management judgments around customer return patterns and return rates 
we utilize historical return patterns to estimate our expected returns 

table of contents although we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns  there is a possibility that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts 
a change in the sales return reserve would have had a impact on our net earnings for the year ended january  allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in our nordstrom private label card and nordstrom visa credit card receivables as of the balance sheet date 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on several factors  including historical trends of aging of accounts  write off experience and expectations of future performance 
we recognize finance charges on delinquent accounts until the account is written off 
delinquent accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible  usually after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations 
in prior years  we have not made material changes to our estimates involved in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a change in our allowance for doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by for the fiscal year ended january  income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  we calculate income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and respective tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which we expect those temporary differences to reverse 
as audits of income tax returns for prior years are completed  adjustments may occur related to previously recorded deferred taxes 
these potential adjustments  if any  are not expected to be material

sfas r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
sfas r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  early adoption is not permitted 
generally  the effect of sfas r will depend on the circumstances of any potential future acquisition

it also requires consolidated net earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings to include the amount of net earnings attributable to minority interest 
this statement will be effective for nordstrom as of the beginning of fiscal year early adoption is not permitted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in millions interest rate risk our primary exposure to market risk is through changes in interest rates 
in seeking to minimize risk  we manage exposure through our regular operating and financing activities 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
we have both credit card receivables that generate finance charge income and debt obligations for which we pay fixed and variable interest expense 
we manage our net interest rate exposure through our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings 
a portion of our credit card receivables maintains a fixed interest rate 
additionally  a portion of this portfolio is used as convenience by our customers who pay in full monthly 
the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in interest rates would not materially affect net earnings 
additionally  short term borrowing and investing activities generally bear interest at variable rates  but because they have maturities of three months or less  we believe that the risk of material loss is low  and that the carrying amount approximates fair value
