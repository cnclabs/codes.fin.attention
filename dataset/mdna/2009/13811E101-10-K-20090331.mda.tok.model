this md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements the notes 
strategic overview canterbury park holding corporation was incorporated under the laws of minnesota and acquired land and buildings to conduct pari mutuel horse racing operations in march the racetrack is located in shakopee  minnesota  approximately miles southwest of downtown minneapolis 
in may  we commenced year round horse racing simulcast operations and hosted the first annual live race meet during the summer of our live racing operations are a seasonal business as we host live race meets each year from may until late summer 
we earn additional pari mutuel revenue by televising our live racing to out of state racetracks around the country 
we also derive revenues from related services and activities  such as advertising  admissions  parking and publication sales and from other entertainment events and activities held at the racetrack 
in april  we opened canterbury park s card club the card club 
the card club operates hours a day  seven days a week and is limited by minnesota state law to a maximum of tables 
the card club currently offers tables of poker games and tables of casino games 
our three largest sources of revenues  card club operations  pari mutuel operations and concessions sales  generate cash revenues 
consequently  the company is highly liquid and has not utilized its line of credit in over five years 
financial performance summary net revenues operating expenses income before income tax expense income tax expense net income the primary strengths of canterbury park are our dedicated and capable staff  our first class facilities and acre property and the legal authority to offer our unique gaming products in our market area 
our management team has extensive knowledge of the horse racing and card businesses and our staff has demonstrated a commitment to our customers 
we continue to implement improvements to our comprehensive customer satisfaction measurement and enhancement program 
our management team has a good relationship with our workforce and is able to retain qualified personnel as demonstrated by our low turnover rate 
our facilities are modern by racetrack industry standards  and we have invested heavily in the past few years to update and upgrade them to meet the needs of our customers and horsemen 
our acre property with a prime location in one of the fastest growing counties in minnesota provides us with great long term growth and development opportunities 
our board of directors is engaged in an evaluation of the highest and best potential uses of our underutilized land 
our long term strategic direction is to enhance the character of our property as a unique gaming and entertainment destination 

table of contents we have a strong commitment to live racing and have been particularly successful in attracting new customers and providing a quality live racing experience for our horse racing fans as well as the horsemen who participate in the live racing at canterbury park 
the success of the card club has greatly enhanced our ability to offer a more competitive purse structure for live racing and has allowed us to make significant improvements to our grandstand and the backside stabling and training facilities 
as a result  we have been near capacity for horses stabled at canterbury park during our recent live race meets 
we continue to believe that our best option for long term growth is to gain authority under minnesota law to offer additional gaming options  which would enhance horse racing with increased purses  provide growth and development opportunities and produce significant new tax revenues for state and local governments 
the effort to obtain legislative authority for these initiatives has required  and will continue to require  substantial expenditures 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcome of legislative activities  there can be no assurance that any bills favorable to the company s interests will be enacted into law  and it is possible  as a result of the legislative process  that legislation directly or indirectly adverse to the company may be enacted into law 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets at december  we utilize our judgment in various ways including determining whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset  determining the estimated useful lives of assets  and determining if or when an asset has been impaired 
management periodically reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of these assets with their related expected future net cash flows 
should the sum of the related expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value  we will determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
an impairment loss would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
to date  we have determined that no impairment of these assets exists 
stock based employee compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised sfas no  share based payment sfas r 
this statement superceded apb opinion no 
 which resulted in no stock based employee compensation cost related to stock options if the options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
sfas r requires recognition of employee services provided in exchange for a share based payment based on the grant date fair market value 
the company adopted sfas r as of january  as of the effective date  this statement applies to all new awards issued as well as awards modified  repurchased or cancelled 
additionally  for stock based awards issued prior to the effective date  compensation cost attributable to future services will be recognized as the remaining service is rendered 
the company elected to apply the modified prospective method of adoption of sfas r 

table of contents regulation our business can be materially impacted both positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes  such as those previously described 
significant negative changes resulting from these activities could result in an impairment of our property and equipment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by regulatory and legislative changes are included in item vi and item vii  respectively  in this form k 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas for financial assets and liabilities is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and the company has adopted the standard for those assets and liabilities as of january  and the impact of adoption had no impact on our financial position or results of operation 
see note for further discussion 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas became effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected not to implement the fair value option with respect to any existing assets or liabilities  therefore  the adoption of sfas had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  business combinations 
sfas r applies to all business combinations 
under sfas r  an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair values on the acquisition date 
we are required to adopt this statement starting in and it is to be applied to business combinations occurring in and after 
early adoption of this statement is prohibited 
the company will evaluate the impact the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on any future business combinations 
contingencies in connection with the purchase of the racetrack  the company entered into an earn out promissory note dated march  in accordance with the earn out note  if i off track betting becomes legally permissible in the state of minnesota and ii we begin to conduct off track betting with respect to or in connection with its operations  we will be required to pay to the imr fund  lp the greater of  per operating year as defined  or of the net pretax profit as defined  for each of five operating years 
at this time  we believe that the likelihood that these two conditions will be met and that we will be required to pay these amounts is remote 
at the date if any that these two conditions are met  the five minimum payments will be discounted back to their present value and the sum of those discounted payments will be capitalized as part of the purchase price in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the purchase price will be further increased if payments become due under the of net pretax profit calculation 
the first payment is to be made days after the end of the third operating year in which off track betting is conducted by us 
remaining payments would be made within days of the end of each of the next four operating years 
the company is periodically involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management believes that the resolution of any pending claims and legal actions at december  and as of the date of this report will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements
