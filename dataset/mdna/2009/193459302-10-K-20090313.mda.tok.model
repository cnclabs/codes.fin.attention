table of contents the financial data reflects the retroactive presentation of the for stock split which occurred on october  in addition to gaap earnings  we also use earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda as a means to evaluate the liquidity and performance of our business  including the preparation of annual operating budgets and the determination of levels of operating and capital investments 
in particular  we believe ebitda allows us to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance 
for example  we believe the inclusion of items such as taxes  interest expense  and intangible asset amortization can make it more difficult to identify and assess operating trends affecting our business and industry 
we also believe ebitda is a performance measure that provides investors  securities analysts and other interested parties a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  business acquisitions  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies in our industry 
ebitda s usefulness as a performance measure is limited  however by the fact that it excludes the impact of interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes 
we borrow money in order to finance our operations  therefore  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
similarly  our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate income 
since we are subject to state and federal income taxes  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
due to these limitations  we do not  and you should not  use ebitda as the sole measure of our performance and liquidity 
we also use  and recommend that you consider  net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties  including those described under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we assume no obligation to update any of these forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this report 
overview we are a leading designer  developer  manufacturer and supplier of electrical wire and cable products for consumer  commercial and industrial applications  with operations primarily in the us and  to a lesser degree  canada 
we manufacture and supply a broad line of wire and cable products  which enables us to offer our customers a single source of supply for many of their wire and cable product requirements 
we manufacture our products in eight domestic manufacturing locations and supplement our domestic production with both international and domestic sourcing 
we sell our products to a variety of customers  including a wide range of specialty 
table of contents distributors  retailers and original equipment manufacturers oems 
virtually all of our products are sold to customers located in the us and canada 
during the first quarter of  we changed our management reporting structure and the manner in which we report our financial results internally  including the integration of our acquisitions for reporting purposes 
the changes resulted in a change in our reportable segments 
accordingly  we now have two reportable business segments distribution  and oem 
our distribution segment serves our customers in distribution businesses  who are resellers of our products  while our oem segment serves our oem customers  who generally purchase more tailored products from us which are in turn used as inputs into subassemblies of manufactured finished goods 
where applicable  prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the new reporting structure 
our net sales follow general business cycles 
additionally  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  certain seasonal trends in net sales and cash flow 
historically  our sales have been somewhat higher in the third and fourth quarters relative to the first and second quarters due to increased buying in anticipation of  and during  the winter months and holiday season 
acquisitions from time to time  we consider acquisition opportunities that have the potential to materially increase the size of our business operation or provide us with some other strategic advantage 
we made two such acquisitions during copperfield  llc on april   we acquired of the outstanding equity interests of copperfield for million  including acquisition related costs and working capital adjustments 
the acquisition of copperfield  which at the time of our acquisition was one of the largest privately owned manufacturers and suppliers of electrical wire and cable products in the united states with annual sales in excess of million  increased our scale  diversified and expanded our customer base and we believe has strengthened our competitive position in the industry 
woods industries  inc on november   we acquired the electrical products business of katy  which operated in the us as woods us and in canada as woods canada 
woods was principally focused on the design and distribution of consumer electrical cord products  sold primarily to national home improvement  mass merchant  hardware and other retailers 
we purchased certain assets of woods us and all the stock of woods canada for million  including acquisition related costs and working capital adjustments 
the acquisition of woods has expanded our us business while enhancing our market presence and penetration in canada 
production costs overview and impact of copper prices raw materials  primarily copper  comprise the primary component of our cost of goods sold 
for  copper costs have been estimated by us based on the average comex price to account for over of our total cost of goods sold 
as the price of copper is particularly volatile  price fluctuations can significantly affect of our sales and profitability 
we generally attempt to pass along changes in the price of copper and other raw materials to our customers 
this becomes somewhat more challenging when the price of copper increases only gradually over time rather than increasing rapidly and significantly in a relatively short period of time 
conversely  when the price of copper declines only marginally and slowly over time  we are more likely to maintain our prices 
however  the ability to maintain product pricing is limited in the event of significant and rapid declines in the price of copper  particularly when such a decline is coupled with a decline in demand for volume within the industry  as was the case in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the average price of copper cathode on the comex was per pound  a decline of per pound  or  from the average price for the fourth quarter of  and a decline of per pound  or  from the average price for the third quarter of the average copper price on the comex was and for january and february  respectively 
for the year  the daily selling price of copper cathode on the comex averaged per pound in  down from the average price in 
table of contents in addition to the above noted factors  other factors affecting product pricing include the type of product involved  competitive conditions  including the extent of underutilized manufacturing capacity existing in the industry  and particular customer arrangements 
current business environment our results for were heavily impacted by the recessionary economic conditions prevalent during the fourth quarter 
our sales volumes declined significantly throughout the fourth quarter of  as compared to both the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of furthermore  the rate of decline accelerated toward the end of the fourth quarter  a trend that has continued into we believe our customers have reduced their inventory levels in the face of weakened demand and an uncertain and difficult economy 
we do not believe we have lost any meaningful market share outside of the impact of our deliberate customer rationalization efforts within oem 
the recessionary environment prevalent during the fourth quarter  along with a sharp decline in the price of copper noted above  had a significant negative impact on our results for both the fourth quarter and consequently the full year results for we believe the market softness and economic difficulties experienced in late have and will continue to be prevalent throughout our business is being managed with a view to the recessionary factors now present continuing throughout the coming year and we believe that  along with reduced volumes associated with the planned downsizing of our oem segment  such factors will cause significant reductions in our volumes for  as compared to levels 
our ability to timely and effectively match capacity to forecasted demand will be a key determinant in limiting the potential negative impact of unfavorable overhead variances in coming quarters 
management is continually adjusting plans and production schedules in light of sales trends  the macro economic environment and other demand indicators  and the possibility exists that we may determine further plant closings  restructurings and workforce reductions are necessary  some of which may be significant 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statement of operations data in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of net sales 
our results for reflect the full year impact of our above noted acquisitions  whereas the results for do not include the entire impact of the acquisitions  which occurred during the course of that year 
as noted above  copperfield was acquired april  and woods was acquired november  accordingly  our results of operations include approximately nine months of operating results for copperfield and one month of operating results for woods 
year ended december  amount amount amount in thousands net sales gross profit selling  engineering  general and administrative expenses intangible asset amortization asset impairments restructuring operating income loss interest expense other income loss  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss 
table of contents in addition to gaap earnings  we also use earnings from continuing operations before net interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda as a means to evaluate the liquidity and performance of our business  including the preparation of annual operating budgets and the determination of levels of operating and capital investments 
in particular  we believe ebitda allows us to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance 
for example  we believe the inclusion of items such as taxes  interest expense and intangible asset amortization can make it more difficult to identify and assess operating trends affecting our business and industry 
we also believe ebitda is a performance measure that provides investors  securities analysts and other interested parties a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  business acquisitions  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies in our industry 
however  ebitda s usefulness as a performance measure is limited by the fact that it excludes the impact of interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes 
we borrow money in order to finance our operations  therefore  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
similarly  our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate income 
since we are subject to state and federal income taxes  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
due to these limitations  we do not  and you should not  use ebitda as the only measure of our performance and liquidity 
we also use  and recommend that you consider  net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity 
finally  other companies may define ebitda differently and  as a result  our measure of ebitda may not be directly comparable to ebitda of other companies 
the following is a reconciliation of net income  as determined in accordance with gaap  to ebitda

table of contents earnings and performance summary we recorded a net loss of million a loss of per diluted share in  as compared to net income of million per diluted share for  and net income of million per diluted share for net income for these periods was impacted by certain significant items 
the magnitude of such items may vary significantly from period to period and  thereby  have a disproportionate effect on the earnings reported for any given period 
our results for reflect the unfavorable impact of significant non cash asset impairments recorded relative to assets in our oem segment  including machinery and equipment  customer related intangible assets and goodwill 
these non cash impairment charges totaled million million after tax  or per share 
during  we also recorded a non cash charge of million million after tax or per share to fully reserve for an insurance receivable recorded in in connection with an inventory theft which occurred that same year 
in addition  our results for and included million million after tax or per share and million million after tax or per diluted share  respectively  in restructuring charges primarily incurred in connection with the integration of our acquisitions 
the details regarding each of the above noted items are discussed further below 
excluding the impact of the above noted items  our results for as compared to last year primarily reflect the impact of lower operating income in both of our segments  mainly within our oem segment 
our consolidated operating income declined million in  as compared with  excluding the impact of the above noted items 
our oem segment accounted for million of the total million decline  with oem recording an operating loss of million in as compared to operating income of million in our segment results are further discussed in the segment results section 
for  our operating results were also unfavorably impacted by increased interest  depreciation and amortization expense stemming from our acquisitions 
as noted in the current business environment section above  sales demand declined severely in the fourth quarter of as a result of recessionary conditions 
our earnings performance for the fourth quarter and  consequently  for the full year reflect the negative impact of these sales declines 
during the first nine months of  we experienced softness in demand across many of our businesses  however  the expansion of our customer base brought about by our acquisitions allowed us to mitigate its impact on our results 
in contrast  the sales demand declines experienced in the fourth quarter more than offset any favorable impact from our expanded customer base 
we believe our customers have reduced their inventory levels in the face of weakened demand and an uncertain and difficult economy 
we believe the market softness and economic difficulties experienced in late have and will continue to be prevalent throughout key accomplishments for and objectives for in the midst of the current recessionary conditions  we believe our success is contingent upon our performance against the following key objectives effective management of our balance sheet  working capital and controllable costs  continuous proactive monitoring and adjusting of production capabilities and capacity in light of extremely challenging macro economic and industry conditions  successful completion of remaining tasks related to the full integration of our acquisitions which were largely integrated in  and focus on profitable  long term customer relationships and continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our customers by maintaining continued high levels of service  providing innovative and high quality products  and finding ways to retain and expand these relationships 
the following are highlights for in support of the above objectives significantly reduced our debt levels in our total debt was reduced by million in  in significant part as a result of concerted efforts across all of our production facilities to manage our working capital  particularly our inventory levels 
as the price of copper increased significantly during the first half of  we further increased our already significant focus on reducing inventory levels as a means of limiting 
table of contents the impact of rising costs on our working capital requirements 
and  in spite of more recent declines in copper prices  the organization remains focused on reducing stock levels across our supply chain  our capital structure includes a million revolving credit facility  which matures in and had million in excess availability at december  in early  we paid the remaining million balance outstanding on this facility  and as a result  we had no outstanding borrowings and approximately million in excess availability under the facility as of february  we have no required debt repayments until our senior notes mature in  fully integrated our woods acquisition  incorporating this business into our core operations and eliminating separate corporate and distribution functions during the first half of  opened a new   square foot distribution facility in april in pleasant prairie  wisconsin 
this facility allowed for the consolidation of three former distribution facilities located in indianapolis  indiana acquired as part of the woods acquisition  gurnee  illinois  and waukegan  illinois into this single leased distribution facility  closed facilities and consolidated the related operations of a number of the manufacturing and distribution facilities acquired as part of the copperfield acquisition 
this included the consolidation and closure of former copperfield manufacturing and distribution facilities located in avilla  indiana  nogales  arizona  and el paso  texas  primarily into operations at one modern new facility in el paso  texas  in addition  as we have previously indicated  and as discussed in the oem financial operations review section below  during the second half of  we have worked to adjust our pricing and rationalize our customer base within our oem segment the oem rationalization 
the oem rationalization is aimed at improving our overall profitability while also reducing our exposure to certain oem customers heavily impacted by current economic conditions 
however  we anticipate losing significant future oem sales as a result of these decisions  which in turn has required us to review and adjust our asset base and capacity accordingly 
this served as reason in part for our recognition of significant asset impairments during  as further discussed below 
during the last half of  we announced a series of separate planned workforce reductions affecting a number of our manufacturing facilities  as well as our corporate office in waukegan  illinois  as discussed below 
as a result  our headcount at the end of totaled  employees  down more than employees from the end of restructuring and integration of acquisitions we incurred restructuring costs of million and million during and  respectively 
these costs were primarily incurred in connection with the integration of our acquisitions 
our restructuring charges for included million in equipment relocation costs  million in lease termination costs  million in employee severance and relocation costs and million in other exit costs 
for  we incurred a total of million in restructuring costs related to the integration of acquisitions 
these costs were recorded during the fourth quarter of and consisted primarily of other exit costs 
in addition  we recorded a million reserve in for severance costs associated with the planned integration of our acquisitions as a component of purchase accounting 
this reserve was fully utilized in additionally  as part of our integration strategy related to copperfield  as noted above  we closed facilities and consolidated the related operations of a number of the manufacturing and distribution facilities acquired as part of the copperfield acquisition 
this included the consolidation and closure of former copperfield manufacturing and distribution facilities located in avilla  indiana  nogales  arizona  and el paso  texas  primarily into operations at one modern new facility in el paso  texas 
as a result  we have ceased manufacturing operations at former copperfield facilities located in avilla  indiana  nogales  arizona  and within three el paso  texas facilities zaragosa road  inglewood road  and the esther lama road distribution center 
the building and property associated with both the avilla and zaragosa facility are owned and have been classified as assets held for sale recorded at the lower of cost or fair value in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at december  these properties were recorded within property  plant and equipment on our consolidated 
table of contents balance sheet at december   reflecting that they were in use as of december   and consequently did not warrant being classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet at that date 
we remain obligated under long term leases for both the inglewood and nogales  arizona facilities 
at the time these facilities ceased being used in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an expense equal to our estimate of our total remaining obligation under such leases  which run through  reduced by an estimate of potential future sublease income 
we recorded a total of million in such lease termination costs as a component of restructuring expenses in though we have completed the majority of integration activities relative to our acquisitions for which restructuring charges were expected to be incurred  we expect to incur up to million in restructuring charges in for costs associated with the remaining integration activities to be performed 
in addition  during the second half of  we announced and executed a series of separately planned workforce reduction initiatives  including a headcount reduction at our oswego  new york manufacturing facility  and workforce reductions at our el paso  texas facilities and within our corporate offices in waukegan  illinois 
the oswego reductions were made as the result of a decision to transition copper fabrication activities from the oswego plant to our bremen  indiana facility  and resulted in million of restructuring expenses for severance and related benefits paid to affected employees 
the el paso and corporate reductions were in part a function of our integration efforts  as well as in response the deterioration of economic conditions during the fourth quarter of in total  we reduced our headcount by approximately employees during the fourth quarter of as a result of these actions 
management is continually adjusting plans and production schedules in light of sales trends  the macro economic environment and other demand indicators  and the possibility exists that we may determine further plant closings  restructurings and workforce reductions are necessary  some of which may be significant 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales our net sales for were million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
our total sales volume measured in total pounds shipped increased for compared to these full year increases due primarily to the expansion of our customer base as a result of our acquisitions occurred during the first three quarters of the year and are not indicative of more recent trends 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant contraction in demand across our business in the face of recessionary conditions 
volumes declined throughout the quarter as compared to volumes during the first three quarters of  with the rate of decline accelerating toward the end of and into for the fourth quarter of  our total sales volume declined as compared to the same quarter last year  reflecting volume declines of and within our distribution and oem segments  respectively 
the decline in distribution segment volume was mitigated somewhat by the impact of acquisitions  as the fourth quarter of included the full benefit of the woods acquisition  whereas the fourth quarter of included only one month of woods sales 
the significant fourth quarter volume declines were coupled with a sharp drop in the price of copper  reducing our fourth quarter sales to million  a decline of million  or  from the same quarter last year 
during the fourth quarter of copper averaged per pound  representing a decline compared to an average of per pound for the third quarter of  and a decline from an average price of per pound for the fourth quarter last year 
this sharp fourth quarter decline in copper prices mitigated the impact of significant increases in copper prices noted during the first nine months of thus  for the year  the daily selling price of copper cathode on the comex averaged per pound in  representing a decline from the above noted fourth quarter volume declines in reflect a deteriorating economic environment which became particularly difficult within the latter weeks of the year and which has continued into our business is being managed with a view to the recessionary factors now present continuing throughout the coming year and we believe that  along with reduced volumes associated with the planned downsizing of our oem segment as discussed further below  such factors will cause significant reductions in our volumes for  as compared to levels 
gross profit we generated million in total gross profit in compared to million in  a decline of million 
our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit margin for was compared to for both the decline in gross profit dollars and gross profit margin for reflected poor gross profit performance within the oem segment throughout most of  as well as a significant decline in fourth 
table of contents quarter gross profit across both the oem and distribution segments 
our total gross profit increased million in aggregate through the first three quarters of as the impact of our acquisitions more than offset declined margin within the oem segment  as further discussed in the segment level review below 
this increase in margin recorded for the first three quarters of  however  was more than offset by a million decline in margin for the fourth quarter of  as compared to the same quarter last year 
in response to the severe decline in sales demand during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our workforce and plant production  closing our production facilities for an extended period during the fourth quarter given lower demand levels and in order to control stock levels 
these actions lowered our variable labor and overhead costs  but were not enough to offset the unfavorable impact of increased unfavorable overhead variances given the magnitude of the sales demand decline and resulting lower production levels 
these unfavorable variances were a significant factor in both the fourth quarter and full year gross profit declines as compared to the same periods last year 
our ability to timely and effectively match capacity to forecasted demand will be a key determinant in reducing the impact of overhead variances in the coming quarters 
management is continually adjusting plans and production schedules in light of sales trends  the macro economic environment and other demand indicators  and the possibility exists that we may determine further plant closings  restructurings and workforce reductions are necessary  some of which may be significant 
in addition  our margins were negatively impacted by a sharp drop in copper prices during the fourth quarter  as we believe many competing suppliers lowered prices further and more rapidly in the face of the lowered overall demand and excess industry capacity than would be expected in the context of more normal market conditions 
in this regard  our gross profit included the unfavorable impact of a million charge recorded during the fourth quarter to reflect a lower of cost or market adjustment of our on hand inventory as of december  this charge reflects the impact of the above noted severe decline in copper prices during late coupled with weakened sales demand which has created downward pricing pressure in the market  reducing the market value for certain of our inventory below its first in  first out fifo carrying value and requiring an adjustment to reflect such inventory at the lower of cost or market 
selling  engineering  general and administrative we incurred total selling  engineering  general and administrative seg a expense of million in compared to million for  an increase of million 
as a percentage of net sales  seg a expense was in  as compared to in seg a expense for included a non cash charge of million for an allowance established during for an insurance claim we filed for thefts which occurred in at our manufacturing facility in miami lakes  florida  which we have since closed 
during the third quarter of  as a result of failing to secure satisfactory settlement of the matter with our insurers  we commenced legal action in regard to this matter and recorded an allowance for the related insurance receivable 
excluding the impact of this non cash charge  seg a expense for was million  or of total net sales for the remaining million increase in seg a expense for as compared to included a million increase in payroll related expenses  as reduced incentive based payroll expense was more than offset by the impact of headcount increases occurring during the first half of these increases were largely as a result of employees added from our acquisitions 
we significantly reduced our headcount in the second half of  in part due to the integration of the acquisitions  as well as in response to the sharp decline in sales demand experienced late in  as noted above 
the remaining million increase in seg a expense from occurred across a number of general expense categories  most notably professional fees and information technology expenses associated primarily with our integration efforts 
intangible amortization expense we recorded a total of million and million in amortization expense for and  respectively  in connection with intangible assets recognized as part of our acquisitions  primarily copperfield which was acquired in april accordingly  the increased expense recorded in is mainly attributable to the fact that reflects a full year of intangible amortization expense 
estimated amortization expense for the next five years is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset impairments we recorded a total of million in non cash asset impairments in the charges were primarily related to our oem segment and reflected the significant and rapid deterioration in the economic environment that occurred during the fourth quarter of  and which we believe will continue in  as well as capacity reductions within the segment as a result of significantly lower sales demand forecast for future periods 
these lowered sales expectations within the oem segment result from our greatly reducing sales and exposure to a 
table of contents number of customers within the segment  including many who serve the automotive and appliance markets  as further discussed in the segment level analysis below 
see further detail regarding these asset impairments in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
further asset impairments may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in a number of factors or circumstances occur  including but not limited to further deterioration in the macro economic environment or in the equity markets  including the market value of our common shares in particular  deterioration in the performance or our future projections relative to one or more of our reporting units  or changes in our plans for one or more reporting unit or for certain of our long lived asset groups or facilities 
these potential future impairment charges include possible impairment related to goodwill amounts allocated to one or more of our reporting units 
of particular note in this regard is a total of approximately million in goodwill currently allocated to our electrical distribution business  a reporting unit within our distribution reportable segment 
during our annual goodwill test performed in the fourth quarter of  we estimated that only a marginal amount of excess exists between this unit s fair value and respective carrying value 
restructuring charges restructuring charges of million were recorded in compared to million in for  these expenses were primarily incurred in connection with the integration of our acquisitions  including our estimated remaining exposure for leasehold obligations associated with a number locations that closed during for  these expenses were incurred in connection with the closure of our miami lakes and siler city facilities in million  as well as with our integration of our acquisitions million 
all actions associated with the closure of the miami lakes and siler city facilities have been substantially completed as of december  see further detail regarding the integration of our acquisitions and associated restructuring charges in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense we incurred million in interest expense in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase was due primarily to additional expense related to the notes and increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility during as further detailed below in the liquidity and capital resources section  during we increased our total debt level significantly to fund our acquisition activities 
we have since lowered our debt levels 
at december   our total debt was million  down from total debt of million outstanding at december  other income loss  net other loss  net  for primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on our canadian subsidiary  as the canadian dollar weakened significantly as compared to the us dollar during the fourth quarter of in accordance with the relevant accounting rules  a portion of the unrealized loss associated with this change in exchange rates is required to be recognized currently in earnings 
income tax expense benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december   with the decline reflecting the pre tax loss in year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales our net sales for were million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase includes the impact of adding the copperfield business on april   which accounted for million of our consolidated net sales in  and an increase of in our consolidated net sales for as compared to excluding copperfield  our net sales increased million in  or  compared to  with the increase primarily reflecting volume growth measured in terms of pounds of product shipped within our retail distribution business  including the impact of the woods business  and the impact of price increases associated with raw material cost increases 
our total volume increased in  with current year acquisitions accounting for a increase in our total volume compared to levels 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  our total volume declined 
gross profit we generated million in total gross profit in compared to million in  an increase of million 
our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit margin for was compared to for both the increase in gross profit dollars and decline in gross profit margin for primarily reflect the impact of adding copperfield in april copperfield prices its products to earn a fixed dollar gross profit per pound of goods sold  which serves to mitigate the effect of copper price volatility  but which compresses gross profit margins when the market price for copper increases 
excluding copperfield  which 
table of contents generated million in gross profit for  our gross profit declined million in and our gross profit margin declined as a percentage of net sales  as compared to these declines reflect the impact of pricing pressures throughout due to contracting market conditions  inflationary pressures related to certain raw material costs  including pvc and fuel costs  and an increase in factory variances in due primarily to labor inefficiencies 
selling  engineering  general and administrative we incurred total selling  engineering  general and administrative seg a expense of million in compared to million for  an increase of million 
this increase reflects the impact of the addition of copperfield  which accounted for million of the increase  increased stock compensation expense which accounted for million of the total increase excluding copperfield related options given that includes a full year of expense recorded for our stock option plan  which was established in october  and an aggregate increase of million across a number of other corporate expenses  most notably professional fees and payroll and related costs 
as a percentage of net sales  seg a expense was in  as compared to in  reflecting the impact of increased expense leverage as our fixed costs were spread over a higher net sales base 
intangible amortization expense we recorded million in amortization expense in primarily related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the copperfield acquisition 
as copperfield was acquired in april of  intangible amortization expense recorded for reflects approximately nine month s of expense 
accordingly  we expect increased intangible amortization expense for  as set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges restructuring charges of million were recorded in compared to million in these expenses were incurred in connection with the integration of copperfield in million  and the closure of our miami lakes and siler city facilities in million  million 
all actions associated with the closure of the miami lakes and siler city facilities have been substantially completed as of december  see further detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense we incurred million in net interest expense in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility during  as compared to  and the million of notes issued during april of the current year 
we increased our total debt level significantly during to fund our acquisition activities  as further detailed below in the liquidity and capital resources section 
other income loss  net other loss  net  for included million for estimated costs pursuant to the tax matters agreement 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in compared to million for the year ended december  income tax expense increased due to a change from s corporation status to c corporation status in october  resulting in increased tax expense

the company s segments have common production processes  and manufacturing and distribution capacity 
accordingly  we do not identify net assets to our segments 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part i  item of this document 
distribution segment in  net sales increased million  or  compared to as noted above in our discussion of consolidated results  this increase was due primarily to an increase in our sales in this segment during the first three quarters of  partially offset by a significant decline in volume during the fourth quarter of our sales increased in this segment during the first three quarters of due both to increased copper prices and more notably an increase in our customer base as a result of our acquisitions which occurred during as noted above in our review of consolidated results  during the fourth quarter of we experienced a significant contraction in demand across our business in the face of recessionary conditions 
our total sales volume declined within our distribution segment  with the decline mitigated somewhat by the impact of acquisitions  as the fourth quarter of included the full benefit of the woods acquisition  whereas the fourth quarter of included only one month of woods sales 
these significant fourth quarter volume declines were coupled with a sharp drop in the price of copper  reducing our total distribution net sales for the quarter to million  a decline of million  or  from the fourth quarter of we believe the sales trends for the fourth quarter are more indicative of future trends expected within this segment than those sales results recorded for the full year of  as compared to prior year 
for  our total distribution segment sales were million  as compared to million in sales for  an increase of million  or  reflecting the impact of acquisitions 
operating income was million in compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was a function of a significant decline in operating income recorded during the fourth quarter of  as compared to prior quarters in the year  as well as compared to the same quarter in as noted above  the recessionary conditions existing during the fourth quarter of caused a significant and rapid decline in our volumes 
given this rapid decline  our profitability decreased for the same period  as we were not able to offset the impact of the decline with cost savings associated with reduced production levels  and as a result  we experienced a significant increase in unfavorable overhead variances during the quarter 
the increase in operating income in  as compared to  was attributable to the favorable impact of expanding our customer base as a result of our acquisitions 
oem segment for  net sales were million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
as noted above  this increase was due primarily to increased sales recorded during the first half of as a result of an increase in our customer base resulting from our acquisitions that occurred after the first quarter of oem segment sales declined during the second half of  with a significant decline during the fourth 
table of contents quarter of in the face of recessionary conditions 
for the fourth quarter of  our total sales volume declined within our oem segment  as compared to the fourth quarter of  reflecting decreased demand from existing customers which have been particularly affected by the current economic circumstances 
in addition to continuing to be negatively impacted by recessionary conditions  the volume of business we have forecasted for our oem segment in is significantly below levels given our decision to reduce the extent of our sales to many customers within the segment as a result of failing to secure adequate pricing for our products  as further discussed below 
as a result of these factors and given the relatively low price of copper in existence during early  as compared to  we anticipate sales dollars generated by our oem segment may total less than half of their level 
for  our total oem segment sales were million  as compared to million in sales for with the increase reflecting the impact of acquisitions  as copperfield was acquired in april of we recorded an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million for  a decline of million 
the oem operating loss for excludes the impact of asset impairment charges  which we record as a component of corporate related expenses 
in addition to the impact of a severe decline in fourth quarter sales and profits as a result of recessionary conditions prevalent during the quarter  our oem results for were also negatively impacted by our inability to timely pass on inflationary raw material cost increases to our customers within this segment during this was of particular importance in our decision to address customer relationships within this segment  including our requirement for increased prices relative to future business 
we believe this decision  while significantly reducing the volume done with certain customers within the segment and  thus  our expected sales for as discussed above  was necessary to ensure the viability of this segment  as well as improve the overall financial performance of the company 
the increase in operating income in  as compared to  was attributable to the favorable impact of expanding our customer base as a result of our acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources during  in connection with financing the copperfield acquisition  we issued million aggregate principal of senior notes defined below thereby increasing the total outstanding principal of senior notes to million 
also in connection with the copperfield acquisition  our five year revolving credit facility was amended and restated  increasing our total borrowing capacity under the facility up to a maximum of million 
we borrowed against the facility to fund our acquisition of woods  resulting in outstanding borrowings under the facility of million at december  during  we significantly paid down the revolving credit facility using cash flow from operations 
we ended with a total of million in debt  a reduction of million from december  in addition  we repaid the entire million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  subsequent to year end  and as of february   had no outstanding borrowings against the facility 
also  as of february   we have no required debt repayments until our senior notes mature in debt our outstanding debt including capital lease obligations was as follows as of december  in thousands revolving credit facility expiring april  senior notes due october   including unamortized premium of  and  respectively capital lease obligations other debt total debt 
table of contents revolving credit facility our five year revolving credit facility is a senior secured facility that provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million  subject to certain limitations 
the proceeds from the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including merger and acquisition activity 
pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain a minimum of million in excess availability under the facility at all times 
borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable  of eligible inventory and an advance rate to be determined of certain appraised fixed assets  with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
at december   we had million in remaining excess availability 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries on a joint and several basis  either as a co borrower of the company or a guarantor  and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries  including accounts receivable  inventory and any other tangible and intangible assets including real estate  machinery and equipment and intellectual property  as well as by a pledge of all the capital stock of each of our domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of each of our foreign subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility contains financial and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to pay dividends or distributions  incur indebtedness  permit liens on property  make investments  provide guarantees  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  enter into leases or sale and lease back transactions  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we are also prohibited from making prepayments on the senior notes  except for scheduled payments required pursuant to the terms of such senior notes 
in addition to maintaining a minimum of million in excess availability under the facility at all times  the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to for any month during which our excess availability under the revolving credit facility falls below million 
we maintained greater than million of monthly excess availability in on november   the revolving credit facility was amended to allow for our acquisition of woods 
the amendment also permitted us to make future investments in our canadian subsidiaries in an aggregate amount  together with the investment made to acquire woods canada  not to exceed million 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our revolving credit facility 
senior notes at december   we had million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding  all of which mature on october  the senior notes 
as noted above  the senior notes include the million aggregate principal amount of notes issued in connection with our acquisition of copperfield 
the notes are governed by the same indenture the indenture and have substantially the same terms and conditions as our million aggregate principal of senior notes issued in the notes 
we are prohibited under the terms of the revolving credit facility from making prepayments on the senior notes 
the indenture includes a covenant that prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  including but not limited to the maximum availability under our revolving credit facility  unless our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than to as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants for our senior notes 
current and future liquidity in general  we require cash for working capital  capital expenditures  debt repayment and interest 
our working capital requirements tend to increase when we experience significant demand for products or significant copper price increases 
in the fourth quarter of  the price of copper declined significantly which lowered our working capital requirements and  thus  in part  allowed us to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents our management assesses the future cash needs of our business by considering a number of factors  including historical earnings and cash flow performance  future working capital needs  current and projected debt service expenses  planned capital expenditures  and our ability to borrow additional funds under the terms of our revolving credit facility 
based on the foregoing  we believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
our capital structure includes a million revolving credit facility  which matures in and had million in excess availability at december  in early  we paid the remaining million balance outstanding on this facility  and as a result  we had no outstanding borrowings and approximately million in excess availability under the facility as of february  we have no required debt repayments until our senior notes mature in if we experience a deficiency in earnings with respect to our fixed charges in the future  we would need to fund the fixed charges through a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
if cash flows generated from our operations  together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility  are not sufficient to fund our operations  debt service and capital expenditures and we need to seek additional sources of capital  the limitations on our ability to incur debt contained in the revolving credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior notes could prevent us from securing additional capital through the issuance of debt 
in that case  we would need to secure additional capital through other means  such as the issuance of equity 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we were not able to secure additional capital  we could be required to delay or forego capital spending or other corporate initiatives  such as the development of products  or acquisition opportunities 
cash flow summary a summary of our cash flows for  and was as follows as of december  in thousands net loss income non cash items changes in working capital assets and liabilities net cash from operating activities net cash from investing activities net cash from financing activities effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and equivalents at beginning of year cash and equivalents at end of year operating activities net cash generated by our operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase from was a function of a million increase in net cash provided from working capital as a function of a sharp decline in the price of copper during the fourth quarter of  as well as our efforts to reduce our stock levels in inventory  and a total of million in non cash items contained in net income  primarily asset impairment charges  depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by a million net loss 
net cash generated by our operating activities was million in compared to million in the decline was a function of a million decline in net income  and a net increase of million to

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in  respectively  with the increase noted in primarily attributable to the acquisition of copperfield and woods 
the million recorded in was mainly attributable to million in capital expenditures  primarily associated with our new facilities in pleasant prairie  wisconsin and el paso  texas 
we anticipate a significant reduction in our capital expenditures for  with a total expected capital expenditure of between million and million 
financing activities net cash used by financing activities was million in compared to net cash provided from financing activities of million in  and million in cash used in financing activities in the million in cash used in financing activities in was due to a reduction in debt brought about both by a decline in the price of copper and  thus  our working capital needs  as well as efforts to reduce our overall working capital  including our inventory levels 
the million provided in was primarily a function of acquisition related borrowing activities 
as noted above  during we issued million in senior notes  generating total proceeds of million net of issuance costs  and increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which were million at december   as compared to million at december  for  we used million in net cash  primarily reflecting the repayment of million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million in other long term debt repayments  the repurchase of million of our common shares in connection with our private placement  and million in dividends paid to our s corporation shareholders  partially offset by million in net proceeds generated from the private placement 
seasonality we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  certain seasonal trends in our sales and cash flow 
we generally require increased levels of cash during the second and third quarters of the year to build inventories in anticipation of higher demand during the late fall and early winter months 
in general  the trade receivables generated from these periods of relatively higher sales is subsequently collected during the late fourth and early first quarter of the year 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt obligations including current portion and interest capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations total long term debt obligations include million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility which has a maturity of while we have classified the million as a short term borrowing on our december  consolidated balance sheet given that we repaid the entire amount subsequent to year end  we 
table of contents have reflected the amount within the year category in the above table given the maturity date of the revolving credit facility 
interest obligations on our variable rate debt  primarily our borrowings under the revolving credit facility  have been calculated based on the prevailing interest rate at december  amounts of future interest payments made on such variable rate borrowings will depend on prevailing variable interest rates in future periods and the amount of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility for such periods 
in early  as a means of managing expenses in light of the weak macro economic environment  the company indefinitely suspended its matching contribution to its defined contribution savings plans for all of the company s non union employees 
accordingly  at this time  we estimate total contributions to the plans will total approximately million in given the indefinite nature of the aforementioned suspension and other factors  we cannot at this time estimate the level of matching contributions which may be made to such plans in years subsequent to purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders and other contractual arrangements for inventory and raw materials 
we anticipate being able to meet our obligations as they come due 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales of our products when the products are shipped to customers and title passes to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale 
we provide incentive allowances to our customers  with the amount of such promotional allowances being tied primarily to the particular customer s level of purchasing activity during a specified time period or periods 
we record an accrual for such promotional allowance and reflect the expense as a reduction of our net sales when we determine that it is probable the allowance will be earned by the customer and the amount of the allowance is reasonably estimated 
we base our accruals primarily on sales activity and our historical experience with each customer 
subsequent period adjustments to our estimates determined in such a manner have not been material during the prior three years 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts to reflect management s best estimate of losses inherent in our receivables as of the balance sheet date given the facts available to us at the time the allowance is recorded 
establishing this allowance involves considerable judgment 
in calculating the necessary allowance for uncollectible accounts  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
we consider both the current financial condition of individual customers and historical write off patterns in establishing our allowance 
when we become aware that  due to deterioration of their financial condition or for some other reason  a particular customer is unable or unwilling to pay an amount owed to us  we record a specific allowance for receivables related to that customer to reflect our best estimate of the realizability of amounts owed 

table of contents inventories inventories include material  labor and overhead costs and are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the first in first out fifo method 
in applying fifo  we evaluate the realizability of our inventory on a product by product basis 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not saleable due to its condition or where the inventory cost for an item exceeds its net realizable value  we record a charge to cost of goods sold and reduce the inventory to its net realizable value 
plant and equipment and other long lived assets plant and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from three to twenty years  using principally the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
our other long lived assets consist primarily of customer related intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions 
these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated amortization methodology which reflects our estimate of the pattern in which the economic benefit derived from such assets is to be consumed 
the carrying value of all long lived assets is evaluated periodically in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or the carrying value is warranted 
when events and circumstances indicate that our long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we test for the existence of impairment by developing and utilizing projections of future cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets or asset groups in question 
our asset groups reflect the shared nature of our facilities and manufacturing capacity 
expected cash flows are projected on an undiscounted basis over the remaining life of the assets or asset groups in question to determine whether such cash flows are expected to exceed the recorded carrying amount of the assets involved 
if we identify the existence of impairment as a result of employing this test  we determine the amount of the impairment loss by the extent to which the carrying value of the impaired assets exceed their fair values as determined by valuation techniques including  as appropriate  the use of discounted cash flows to measure estimated fair value 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  addresses the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized  but instead is subject to an annual impairment test at the reporting unit level  as well as requires interim tests in the event of certain events or circumstances 
we perform our annual test for potential goodwill impairment as of december st of each year 
the test requires that a fair value estimate be made at the reporting unit level as of the test date 
potential impairment exists if the carrying amount of net assets of a particular reporting unit  including goodwill  as of the test date exceeds the then estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we have determined that our operating segments appropriately serve as reporting units as defined by the accounting rules governing  and for purposes of applying  our goodwill impairment tests 
our methods for estimating fair value include the market and income approach 
developing these estimates necessarily involves the use of significant judgments and estimates regarding future performance  including growth assumptions  estimates of profitability and cost trends 
in addition  determining the carrying value  or the net assets for an individual operating segment  requires the use of estimation and allocation methodologies given the shared nature of many of our assets and liabilities 
to the extent possible  we identify assets  such as trade receivables  and liabilities specific to each specific operating segment  however  given our use of primarily shared production facilities and resources  assets such as inventory  fixed assets and accounts payable have to be allocated on a basis reflective of our best estimate of their relative usage by each operating segment 
then  in performing the above described test  if it is determined that the carrying value of a particular operating segment exceeds its estimated fair value  the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill must next be determined 
if the carrying amount of the operating segment s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment of goodwill is deemed to have taken place and a loss is recorded equal to the amount of the excess 
during our annual goodwill test performed in the fourth quarter of  we estimated that only a marginal amount of excess exists between the estimated fair value and respective carrying value for our electrical distribution business  reporting

a total of approximately million in goodwill is currently allocated to our electrical distribution business  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
a provision for income tax expense is recognized for income taxes payable for the current period  plus the net changes in deferred tax amounts 
we periodically assess the reliability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities  including the results of local  state or federal statutory tax audits 
through october   we conducted business as an s corporation  with the exception of our wholly owned c corporation subsidiary  for federal and state income tax purposes 
accordingly  our shareholders had been responsible for federal and substantially all state income tax liabilities arising out of our operations 
for all periods prior to the c corporation conversion  dividends had been paid to shareholders in amounts that approximated the shareholders current tax liability arising from their ownership in the company 
as of october   the day before we consummated the private placement  we ceased to be an s corporation and became a c corporation and  as such  we became subject to federal and state income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are exposure to changes in commodity prices  primarily copper prices  interest rates on borrowings  and exchange rate risk relative to our operations in canada 
commodity risk 
certain raw materials used in our products are subject to price volatility  most notably copper  which is the primary raw material used in our products 
the price of copper is particularly volatile and can affect our net sales and profitability 
we purchase copper at prevailing market prices and  through multiple pricing strategies  generally attempt to pass along to our customers changes in the price of copper and other raw materials 
from time to time  we enter into derivatives  including copper futures contracts  to mitigate the potential impact of fluctuations in the price of copper on our pricing terms with certain customers 
we do not speculate on copper prices 
we record these derivative contracts at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability

we have exposure to changes in interest rates on a portion of our debt obligations 
as of december   approximately of our debt was variable rate  primarily our borrowings under our revolving credit facility for which interest costs are based on either the lenders prime rate or libor 
based on the amount of our variable rate borrowings at december   which totaled approximately million  an immediate one percentage point change in libor would change our annual interest expense by approximately million
