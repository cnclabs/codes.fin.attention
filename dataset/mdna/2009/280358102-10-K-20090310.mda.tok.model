service revenue our service revenue is derived from professional services in providing specialty it services consulting 
specifically  we provide strategy and other management consulting services to develop  implement  integrate  automate and extend business processes  technology infrastructure and enterprise performance management software applications for our clients 
most of our projects  approximately  are performed on a time and materials basis and a smaller amount of revenue is derived from projects performed on either a fixed price or fixed fee basis 
fixed priced engagements represented approximately of our service revenue for the year ended december  fixed fee engagements represented approximately of our service revenue for the year ended december  for time and material projects  revenue is recognized and billed as services are performed 
for fixed price projects  revenue is generally recognized using the proportionate performance method 
provisions for estimated profits or losses on uncompleted projects are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such profits or losses are determined 
on many projects  we are reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenue and cost of revenue 
the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers  the total number of our projects that require travel and whether our arrangements with our clients provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project related expenses 

table of contents operating expenses the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of cash and non cash compensation and benefits associated with our project consulting personnel and related expenses 
non cash compensation includes stock compensation expense arising from restricted stock and option grants to employees 
project personnel expenses also consist of payroll costs and related benefits associated with our professional staff 
other related expenses include travel  subcontracting costs  third party vendor payments and non billable expenses associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
we consider the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue to be an important measure of our operating performance 
the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue is driven largely by the chargeability of our consultant base  the prices we charge our clients and the non billable costs associated with securing new client engagements and developing new service offerings 
the remainder of our recurring operating expense is comprised of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  and management and administrative support 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance  information systems  human resources  facilities including the rent of office space  and other administrative support for project personnel 
we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry  and that our overhead costs are balanced with our revenue levels 
in addition  we monitor the progress of client projects with client senior management 
we manage the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements 
however  a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services that we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned 
in addition  because most of our client engagements are terminable by our clients without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must also maintain a sufficient number of consulting professionals to oversee existing client engagements and to participate in sales activities to secure new client assignments 
company performance measurement systems and metrics the company s management monitors and assesses its operating performance by evaluating key metrics and indicators on an ongoing basis 
for example  we regularly review performance information related to annualized revenue per billable consultant  periodic consultant utilization rates  gross profit margins  average bill rates and billable employee headcount 
edgewater has also developed internal enterprise performance management systems which aid us in measuring our operating performance and consultant utilization rates 
the matching of sales opportunities to available skill sets in our consultant base is one of our greatest challenges and therefore  we monitor consultant utilization closely 
these metrics  along with other operating and financial performance metrics  are used in evaluating management s overall performance 
these metrics and indicators are discussed in more detail under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results for the year ended december  compared to results for the year ended december  goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges following the second quarter of  as a result of the economic environment impacting our business and results and an overall decline in billable consultant utilization coupled with a material decline of the company s stock price since december of  the company determined that it had identified an impairment triggering event that would require an interim impairment evaluation of the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets 
based upon the results of the impairment procedures performed  which are more fully described under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets the impairment review procedures  the company recognized impairment charges of million and million during the second quarter of related to goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
during the third quarter of  the company reviewed both its market capitalization  as compared to book value of equity  and operating results  as compared to forecasts and projections  and did not identify the existence of a triggering event which would require a formal review of the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets 
subsequently  on december  in connection with the company s annual review for impairment the annual impairment review  we determined that the carrying value of the company s single reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
as a result  we determined that the carrying value of the company s goodwill and intangible assets had become further impaired 
the impairment review procedures performed by the company resulted in the recognition of additional impairment charges of million and million during the fourth quarter of related to goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 

table of contents collectively  the impairment charges resulting from both our interim review for impairment and our annual impairment review are referred to as the impairment charges 
the impairment charges are discussed in more detail under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
increase to deferred tax asset valuation allowance we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
in evaluating our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attribute 
this assessment requires significant management judgment 
the impairment charges recorded by the company increased the gross carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets by approximately million 
the increase was directly related to the recognition of future deductible temporary timing differences associated with the impairment of the tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets 
additionally  the impairment charges also served to place the company into a trailing three year cumulative loss position 
as of december   the company performed an evaluation of the more than likely recoverability of the gross carrying value of its deferred tax assets  which considered and evaluated positive evidence recent trend of tax basis profitability and negative evidence cumulative loss position as of december  as a result of the current year impairment charges the dta review 
the dta review primarily centered upon the carrying value and future recoverability of the company s federal net operating loss nol carryforwards  a majority of which expire on december   and the consideration of certain other alternative minimum and foreign tax credits 
the company s forecasts and projections were a key assumption utilized in the dta review 
while the company s current forward looking forecasts and projections support a continued profitability trend  we are projecting a reduction in near term earnings which reflects the current economic climate impacting it consulting companies 
as a result  our future projections reduce our profitability to levels in which it is not more than likely that the company will be able to fully realize future economic benefit from all of its federal net operating loss carryforwards and other tax related credits 
accordingly  the dta review resulted in the company recording an increase to its deferred tax valuation allowance of million during the fourth quarter of  reducing the net carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets to their estimated more likely than not realizable amount 
the current year increase to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is discussed in more detail under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
any future changes in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense benefit and reduce or increase stockholders equity  and such changes could have a significant impact upon our future reported results 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions  upon which we rely  are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements may be affected 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  share based compensation  goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets  income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets  and purchase price allocation 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee
