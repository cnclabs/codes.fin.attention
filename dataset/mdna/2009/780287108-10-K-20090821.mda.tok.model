item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview royal gold  together with its subsidiaries  is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metals royalties 
royalties are passive non operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or production from the project after deducting specified costs  if any 
we seek to acquire existing royalties or to finance projects that are in production or in development stage in exchange for royalty interests 
we are engaged in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing royalties  to create new royalties through the financing of mine development or exploration  or to acquire companies that hold royalties 
we currently  and generally at any time  have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review  including  for example  our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities  analysis of technical  financial and other confidential information  submission of indications of interest  participation in preliminary discussions and involvement as a bidder in competitive auctions 
the company owns royalties on producing properties  development stage properties and over exploration stage properties  of which the company considers to be evaluation stage projects 
the company uses evaluation stage to describe exploration stage properties that contain mineralized material and on which operators are engaged in the search for reserves 
we do not conduct mining operations  nor are we required to contribute to capital costs  exploration costs  environment costs or other operating costs on the properties in which we hold royalty interests 
during the fiscal year ended june   we focused on the management of our existing royalty interests  the acquisition of royalty interests  and the creation of royalty interests through financing and strategic exploration alliances 
our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold and other metals  as well as production from our producing stage royalty interests 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  the price of gold averaged  and per ounce  respectively  the price of silver averaged  and per ounce  respectively  and the price of copper averaged  and per pound  respectively 
the price of gold and other metals have fluctuated widely in recent years 
the marketability and the price of gold and other metals are influenced by numerous factors beyond the control of the company and may have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
for the fiscal year ended june   royal gold derived of its total revenue from gold royalties  of its total revenue from silver royalties  of its total revenue from copper royalties and of its total revenue from other metal royalties 
the increase in the average gold price  production from the recently acquired barrick royalty portfolio notably mulatos and siguiri  an increase in production at taparko and leeville  and commencement of production at pe asquito and dolores  contributed to royalty revenue of million during the fiscal year ended june   compared to royalty revenue of million during the fiscal 
table of contents year ended june  the increase in our royalty revenue during fiscal year was partially offset due to a decrease in production and a reduction in our gsr royalty rate as part of the barrick transaction discussed below at cortez and a decrease in production and negative provisional pricing adjustments at robinson

business developments proposed acquisition of andacollo production interest on april   the company entered into a definitive agreement master agreement with a chilean subsidiary of teck resources limited teck  cda  to acquire an interest in the gold produced from the sulfide portion of the andacollo project in chile the andacollo production interest 
the purchase price for the andacollo production interest consists of million in cash and  of the company s common shares 
the andacollo production interest will equal of the gold produced from the sulfide portion of the deposit at the andacollo mine until  payable ounces of gold have been sold  and of the gold produced in excess of  payable ounces of gold 
the mine  located about miles southeast of the city of la serena  chile  produces copper from the oxide portion of the deposit and teck is currently constructing facilities to produce both copper and gold from the sulfide portion of the deposit 
the andacollo production interest will not cover copper production 
proven and probable reserves  as estimated by the operator as of december   for the sulfide portion are million tonnes million tons with a grade of copper and g t ozs ton gold 
this equates to million contained ounces of gold 
reserves were estimated using a copper price of per pound and a gold price of per ounce 
gold will be produced as a by product of copper production  with a gold recovery rate estimated by the operator to be approximately 
once the mine is in full production  the operator expects the mill to have a capacity of  tonnes  tons per day 
the operator estimates that the mine will produce on average approximately  ounces of gold and  tonnes  tons of copper in concentrate annually for the first years of commercial production  with an estimated mine life of years 
the mine is estimated to begin initial production of gold in the fourth quarter of calendar  with commercial production at the mine to be achieved in the first half of calendar year  unless this schedule is delayed by challenges to previously granted permits relating to cda s water supply  as recently announced by teck 
on august   teck announced that they have encountered challenges to the previously granted permits for the process water supply  which may result in a delay in the start up of the sulfide milling operations 
royal gold s obligation to close the teck transaction is subject to cda s completion of concentrate marketing for a specified percentage of its concentrate production from the andacollo mine  the condition that cda s material government approvals are not withdrawn or challenged  and completion of certain limited due diligence satisfactory to royal gold  as well as other customary closing conditions 
to accommodate the potential delay in the start up of the sulfide milling operations  we have agreed to extend the outside closing date of the teck transaction 
as such  either party may terminate the definitive agreement if the closing conditions are not met by january

acquisition of barrick royalty portfolio effective october   the company completed its acquisition of royalties from barrick for cash of approximately million  including a restructuring of the company s gsr  gsr and nvr royalties at cortez  valued at million  for net cash of approximately million 
the transactions were completed pursuant to the royalty purchase and sale agreement the agreement dated july  the cash portion of the purchase price for the transaction was paid from the company s cash on hand 
pursuant to the barrick transaction  we acquired royalties on properties in various stages of production  development  evaluation and exploration 
the restructuring of royal gold s royalty positions at cortez consisted of a reduction of the company s gsr sliding scale royalty ranging from to to match the current gsr sliding scale royalty rate ranging from to and the elimination of royal gold s interest in the gsr royalty and the nvr royalty on the mining claims that comprise the undeveloped crossroads deposit 
the gsr and nvr royalties that cover areas outside the crossroads deposit at cortez were not affected by this transaction 
the crossroads deposit continues to be subject to the company s gsr royalty at the sliding scale rate of to 
the royalty portfolio acquired from barrick has generated approximately million in royalty revenue from the completion of the acquisition of the barrick royalty portfolio on october  through june  the key assets in the barrick royalty portfolio include the following properties mulatos a sliding scale nsr royalty currently paying on alamos mulatos mine 
prior to october   we owned a to sliding scale nsr royalty on the property 
this acquisition consolidated the mulatos royalty and increased our royalty interest to a to sliding scale nsr royalty 
at current commodity prices  the mulatos royalty is 
as a result of the acquisition  the company recognized approximately million in additional royalty from completion of the acquisition of the barrick royalty portfolio on october  through june  the royalty is capped at million gold ounces of production and approximately  cumulative gold ounces have been produced through june   canadian malartic a to sliding scale nsr royalty on the canadian malartic gold project  owned by osisko 
osisko announced the completion of a positive feasibility study resulting in proven and probable reserves of million tons of ore  at a grade of ounces per ton  containing million ounces of gold  of which million is subject to our royalty interest 
osisko estimated that gold production over the life of the mine will be approximately  ounces annually 
the royalty is subject to a buy down right and is classified as a development stage royalty interest on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
if the buy down right is exercised by osisko for million to million  the sliding scale nsr royalty would be reduced to  siguiri a sliding scale nsr royalty currently paying on the siguiri gold mine in guinea  west africa  operated by anglogold ashanti 
the company recognized approximately million since the acquisition of the barrick royalty portfolio on october  through june  the royalty is capped on a dollar basis and approximately million remains under the cap as of june   and

property developments taparko the taparko mine commenced gold production in august and has contributed approximately million in royalty revenue from tb gsr and tb gsr since production commenced 
reserve characteristics  mining activity  and gold recovery performance has been near feasibility study estimates 
however  mill performance has suffered since start up due to problems associated with the grinding mill drive train and production ceased on june  a new gear box to correct the mill problems was installed on october   and operations at taparko re commenced on november  although improved  elevated vibrations in certain elements of the mill drive train are still a concern for potential interruptions to sustained production 
despite the mill problems for much of the first half of fiscal year  gold sales at taparko for the fiscal year were approximately  ounces compared to approximately  ounces during fiscal year somita sa somita  a owned subsidiary of high river and the operator of taparko  is in breach of certain obligations under the amended and restated funding agreement dated february  the funding agreement between royal gold  inc and somita 
royal gold has invested million for the development of the taparko mine under the funding agreement 
as security for the company s investment in somita  two of high river s subsidiaries have pledged their equity interests in somita and high river west africa ltd  the corporate parent of somita 
the pledge will remain in effect until certain production and performance standards have been attained at the taparko mine 
in addition  royal gold obtained as collateral a pledge of shares of certain equity investments in public companies held by high river 
the fair market value of the pledged shares is approximately million as of june  the company s carrying value of its royalty interests at taparko was approximately million as of june  the collateral will remain in effect until project completion and attainment of certain production or performance standards at the taparko mine 
royal gold has not agreed to forbear pursuing any of its remedies under the funding agreement or other agreements with high river and its affiliates 
on november   high river announced the closing of an equity financing with lybica holding bv  an affiliate of zao severstal resources  the mining division of oao severstal severstal 
as a result of the equity financing  severstal indirectly holds approximately of high river common stock 

table of contents high river subsequently announced that its ability to continue as a going concern depends on  among other things  its ongoing discussions with its lenders and obtaining additional financing 
on june   severstal announced its offer  which was recommended by the independent directors of high river s board of directors  to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of high river common stock 
severstal increased its offer on june   and declared it full and final  not to be extended beyond august  on august   severstal announced that its take over bid has expired and following the offer  severstal will own  directly and through affiliates  of high river 
cortez the restructuring of the gsr royalty  from a range of to  to match the current gsr sliding scale rate  which ranges from to  along with a decrease in production at cortez  resulted in a decrease in royalty revenue of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in royalty revenue at cortez was primarily due to a decrease in production 
while lower than expected grades were mined during much of our fiscal year  decreased production was driven primarily by mine sequencing that reduced mining activity on the company s royalty ground at cortez 
robinson pursuant to the robinson royalty agreement  our nsr royalty is based upon revenue received by the operator of the mine  quadra  for the sale of minerals from the robinson mine  reduced by certain costs incurred by quadra 
quadra s concentrate sales contracts with third party smelters  in general  provide for a provisional payment based upon assays and quoted metal prices at the date of shipment 
final true up payments are subsequently based upon final assays and market metal prices set on a specified future date 
under current sales contracts between quadra and its third party smelters  final pricing for copper sales is generally set at least four months after the date of shipment 
royal gold recognizes royalty revenue based on amounts contractually due pursuant to the calculations above for the underlying sale 
in the event there are significant pricing variations between the provisional and final settlement periods in copper  and to a lesser extent  gold and silver  royalty revenue recognized by the company on the robinson royalty will be positively or negatively impacted 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recognized approximately million in royalty revenue at robinson compared to million during the fiscal year ended june  this decrease in royalty revenue was attributable to a decrease in copper prices  a decrease in copper sales and negative final pricing adjustments 
during the fiscal years ended june  and  the average price of copper was and per pound  respectively  while the average price of copper during the three months ended december  and september   was and  respectively 
this significant decrease in the price of copper during our first and second fiscal quarters of resulted in quadra having significant negative final pricing adjustments during our second fiscal quarter of furthermore  during the fiscal year ended june   copper sales at robinson were approximately million pounds compared to million pounds during the fiscal year ended june   which also resulted in lower royalty revenue for the period 
the negative final pricing adjustments impacted our royalty revenue by approximately million and million during the three months ended march  and december   respectively 
royal

critical accounting policies listed below are the accounting policies that the company believes are critical to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our most critical accounting estimates relate to our assumptions regarding future gold and other metal prices and the estimates of reserves and recoveries of third party mine operators 
we rely on reserve estimates reported by the operators on the properties in which we have royalty interests 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we charge depreciation  depletion and amortization to earnings 
on an ongoing 
table of contents basis  management evaluates these estimates and assumptions  however  actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
royalty interests in mineral properties as of june   the net carrying value of royalty interests in mineral properties was approximately million 
royalty interests in mineral properties include acquired royalty interests in production stage  development stage and exploration stage properties 
the fair value of acquired royalty interests in mineral properties are capitalized as tangible assets when such interests do not meet the definition of a financial asset under the fasb statement of financial account standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
 or a derivative instrument under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
acquisition costs of production and development stage royalty interests are depleted using the units of production method over the life of the mineral property  which is estimated using proven and probable reserves 
acquisition costs of royalty interests on exploration stage mineral properties  where there are no proven and probable reserves  are not amortized 
at such time as the associated exploration stage mineral interests are converted to proven and probable reserves  the cost basis is amortized over the remaining life of the mineral property  using proven and probable reserves 
the carrying values of exploration stage mineral interests are evaluated for impairment at such time as information becomes available indicating that the production will not occur in the future 
exploration costs are expensed when incurred 
asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of the carrying value of royalty interests in production and development stage mineral properties is evaluated based upon estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from each royalty interest property using estimates of proven and probable reserves and other relevant information received from the operators 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of royalty interests in exploration stage mineral properties in the event of significant decreases in the price of gold and other metals  and whenever new information regarding the mineral properties is obtained from the operator indicating that production will not likely occur in the future thus affecting the future recoverability of our royalty interests 
impairments in the carrying value of each property are measured and recorded to the extent that the carrying value in each property exceeds its estimated fair value  which is generally calculated using estimated future discounted cash flows 
our estimates of gold  silver  copper and other metal prices  operator s estimates of proven and probable reserves related to our royalty properties  and operator s estimates of operating  capital and reclamation costs are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our investment in these royalty interests in mineral properties 
although we have made our best assessment of these factors based on current conditions  it is possible that changes could occur  which could adversely affect the net cash flows expected to be generated from these royalty interests
