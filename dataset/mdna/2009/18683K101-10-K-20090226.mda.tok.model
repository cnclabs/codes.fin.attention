risk factors 
the current global economic crisis has created uncertainty and could adversely affect our business 
the current global economic crisis has adversely affected our business and could impact our financial results 
all of our customers have announced curtailments of production  which has adversely affected the demand for our iron ore and coal products 
continuation or worsening of the current economic conditions  a prolonged global  national or regional economic recession or other events that could produce major changes in demand patterns  could have a material adverse effect on our sales  margins and profitability 
we are not able to predict the impact the current global economic crisis will have on our operations and the industry in general going forward 
steel consumption has slowed globally  leading to excess global capacity  which could result in increasing competition within the steel industry and increased imports into the united states  our largest market  potentially lowering the demand for iron ore and coal 
the world price of iron ore and coal are strongly influenced by international demand 
production at portman  which comprises our asia pacific iron ore segment  is fully committed to steel companies in china and japan 
in addition  approximately percent of production at sonoma is committed under supply agreements with customers in asia  including china 
if the economic growth rate in china slows for an extended period of time  which may be difficult to forecast  less steel would be used in construction and manufacturing  which would decrease demand for iron ore and coal 
this could adversely impact the world iron ore and coal markets and our operations  specifically  at portman and sonoma 
a slowing of the economic growth rate globally leading to overcapacity in the steelmaking industry could also result in greater exports of steel out of eastern europe  asia and latin america  which  if imported into north america  could decrease demand for domestically produced steel  thereby decreasing the demand for iron ore and coal supplied in north america 
china s domestic crude steel production climbed approximately two percent in as compared to based on the american iron and steel institute s apparent steel supply excluding semi finished steel products  imports of steel into the united states constituted approximately percent  percent and percent of the domestic steel market supply for  and  respectively 
further  production of steel by north american integrated steel manufacturers may also be replaced  to some extent  by production of substitute materials by other manufacturers 
in the case of some product applications  north american steel manufacturers compete with manufacturers of other materials  including plastic  aluminum  graphite composites  ceramics  glass  wood and concrete 
most of our term supply agreements for the sale of iron ore products are requirements based or provide for flexibility of volume above a minimum level 
reduced demand for and consumption of iron ore products by integrated steel producers have had and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our sales  margins and profitability 
capacity expansions within the industry could lead to lower global iron ore and coal prices or impact our production 
the increased demand for iron ore and coal  particularly from china  has resulted in the major iron ore and metallurgical coal suppliers increasing their capacity 
in the current economic environment  any increase in our competitors capacity could result in excess supply of iron ore and coal  resulting in increased downward pressure on prices 
a decrease in pricing would adversely impact our sales  margins and profitability 

table of contents the current global economic crisis has resulted in increasing downward pressure on prices for iron ore and metallurgical coal 
the current global economic crisis has resulted in a great deal of pressure from customers  particularly in china  for a roll back of the price increases for seaborne iron ore and metallurgical coal 
the record price increase was driven by high demand for iron ore and coking coal  historically high levels of global steel production  and combined with production and logistics constraints for both iron ore and coking coal  resulted in tight supply conditions 
with the current global economic crisis  none of these conditions exist in early  and the market now is characterized by a collapse in steel demand and limited global demand for iron ore and coking coal 
reduced demand for iron ore and coking coal will likely result in decreased demand for the company s products and decreasing prices  resulting in lower revenue levels in  and decreasing margins as a result of decreased production  adversely affecting our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
if steelmakers use methods other than blast furnace production to produce steel  or if their blast furnaces shut down or otherwise reduce production  the demand for our iron ore and coal products may decrease 
demand for our iron ore and coal products is determined by the operating rates for the blast furnaces of steel companies 
however  not all finished steel is produced by blast furnaces  finished steel also may be produced by other methods that do not require iron ore products 
for example  steel mini mills  which are steel recyclers  generally produce steel primarily by using scrap steel and other iron products  not iron ore pellets  in their electric furnaces 
production of steel by steel mini mills was approximately percent of north american total finished steel production in north american steel producers also can produce steel using imported iron ore or semi finished steel products  which eliminates the need for domestic iron ore 
environmental restrictions on the use of blast furnaces also may reduce our customers use of their blast furnaces 
maintenance of blast furnaces can require substantial capital expenditures 
our customers may choose not to maintain their blast furnaces  and some of our customers may not have the resources necessary to adequately maintain their blast furnaces 
if our customers use methods to produce steel that do not use iron ore and coal products  demand for our iron ore and coal products will decrease  which could adversely affect our sales  margins and profitability 
a substantial majority of our sales are made under term supply agreements  which are important to the stability and profitability of our operations 
in  virtually all of our north american iron ore sales volume  the majority of our north american coal sales  and virtually all of our asia pacific iron ore sales were sold under term supply agreements 
for north american coal  these agreements typically cover a twelve month period and are typically renewed each year 
the asia pacific iron ore contracts expire in our north american iron ore contracts have an average remaining duration of six years 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew or replace existing term supply agreements at the same volume levels  prices or with similar profit margins when they expire 
a loss of sales to our existing customers could have a substantial negative impact on our sales  margins and profitability 
our north american iron ore term supply agreements contain a number of price adjustment provisions  or price escalators  including adjustments based on general industrial inflation rates  the price of steel and the international price of iron ore pellets  among other factors  that allow us to adjust the prices under those agreements generally on an annual basis 
our price adjustment provisions are weighted and some are subject to annual collars  which limit our ability to raise prices to match international levels and fully capitalize on strong demand for iron ore 
most of our north american iron ore term supply agreements do not otherwise allow us to increase our prices and to directly pass through higher production costs to our customers 
an inability to increase prices or pass along increased costs could adversely affect our margins and profitability 
in north america  we depend on a limited number of customers 
five customers together accounted for more than percent of our north american iron ore sales revenues representing more than percent of our overall revenues measured as a percent of product revenue for each of the past three years 
if one or more of these customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of products from us  or if we were unable to sell products to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current 
table of contents term supply agreements  our north american sales  margins and profitability could suffer materially due to the high level of fixed costs and the high costs to idle or close mines 
the majority of the iron ore we manage and produce is for our own account  and therefore we rely on sales to our joint venture partners and other third party customers for most of our revenues 
although we currently have adequate liquidity  if the current global economic crisis extends beyond  we may have difficulty maintaining adequate liquidity 
based on our current borrowing capacity and the actions we have taken in response to the global economic crisis to conserve cash  we have adequate liquidity and expect to fund our business obligations from available cash  current operations and borrowing under our current credit facilities 
however  if the current economic crisis deepens into a long term downturn  it is possible that we will face liquidity issues that will negatively impact our cash flow or borrowing capacity 
in such circumstances  we may be forced to access higher cost forms of capital 
the current global economic crisis may limit available capital 
we expect to grow our business and presence as an international mining company by continuing to expand both geographically and through the minerals that we mine and market 
to execute on this strategy we will need to have access to the capital markets to finance acquisition and developmental mining properties 
in the current global economic crisis access to capital to finance new projects and acquisitions is extremely limited 
if we are unable to access the capital markets our ability to execute on our growth strategy will be negatively impacted 
our ability to collect payments from our customers depends on their creditworthiness 
our ability to receive payment for products sold and delivered to our customers depends on the creditworthiness of our customers 
with respect to our north american coal and asia pacific iron ore business units  payment is typically received as the products are shipped 
however  in our north american iron ore business unit  generally  we deliver iron ore products to our customers facilities in advance of payment for those products 
our rationale for delivering iron ore products to customers in advance of payment for the product is to more closely relate timing of payment to consumption and to reduce our financial risk to customer insolvency  as title and risk of loss with respect to those products does not pass to the customer until payment for the pellets is received 
accordingly  there is typically a period of time in which pellets  for which we have reserved title  are within our customers control 
consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers  some of which are highly leveraged 
these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk 
current credit markets are highly volatile  and some of our customers are highly leveraged 
a significant adverse change in the financial and or credit position of a customer could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer and could limit our ability to collect receivables 
failure to receive payment from our customers for products that we have delivered could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
mine closures entail substantial costs  and if we close one or more of our mines sooner than anticipated  our results of operations and financial condition may be significantly and adversely affected 
if we close any of our mines  our revenues would be reduced unless we were able to increase production at our other mines  which may not be possible 
the closure of a mining operation involves significant fixed closure costs  including accelerated employment legacy costs  severance related obligations  reclamation and other environmental costs  and the costs of terminating long term obligations  including energy contracts and equipment leases 
we base our assumptions regarding the life of our mines on detailed studies we perform from time to time  but those studies and assumptions are subject to uncertainties and estimates that may not be accurate 
we recognize the costs of reclaiming open pits and shafts  stockpiles  tailings ponds  roads and other mining support areas based on the estimated mining life of our property 
if we were to significantly reduce the estimated life of any of our mines  the mine closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production  which would increase production costs per ton produced and could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents a north american mine permanent closure could significantly increase and accelerate employment legacy costs  including our expense and funding costs for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
a number of employees would be eligible for immediate retirement under special eligibility rules that apply upon a mine closure 
all employees eligible for immediate retirement under the pension plans at the time of the permanent mine closure also would be eligible for postretirement health and life insurance benefits  thereby accelerating our obligation to provide these benefits 
certain mine closures would precipitate a pension closure liability significantly greater than an ongoing operation liability 
finally  a permanent mine closure could trigger severance related obligations  which can equal up to eight weeks of pay per employee  depending on length of service 
no employee entitled to an immediate pension upon closure of a mine is entitled to severance 
as a result  the closure of one or more of our mines could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on estimates of our recoverable reserves  which is complex due to geological characteristics of the properties and the number of assumptions made 
we regularly evaluate our north american iron ore and coal reserves based on revenues and costs and update them as required in accordance with sec industry guide portman and sonoma have published reserves which follow joint ore reserves code in australia  which is similar to united states requirements 
changes to the reserve value to make them comply with sec requirements have been made 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves of our mines  many of which have been in operation for several decades  including many factors beyond our control 
estimates of reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as production capacity  effects of regulations by governmental agencies  future prices for iron ore and coal  future industry conditions and operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and costs of extraction and reclamation  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of mineralized deposits attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially as the criteria change 
estimated ore and coal reserves could be affected by future industry conditions  geological conditions and ongoing mine planning 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and if such variances are material  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we rely on our joint venture partners in our mines to meet their payment obligations and are subject to risks involving the acts or omissions of our joint venture partners when we are not the manager of the joint venture 
we co own four of our six north american iron ore mines with various joint venture partners that are integrated steel producers or their subsidiaries  including arcelormittal usa  and us steel canada inc formerly stelco inc  or us steel canada 
while we are the manager of each of the mines we co own  we rely on our joint venture partners to make their required capital contributions and to pay for their share of the iron ore pellets that we produce 
most of our venture partners are also our customers 
if one or more of our venture partners fail to perform their obligations  the remaining venturers  including ourselves  may be required to assume additional material obligations  including significant pension and postretirement health and life insurance benefit obligations 
the premature closure of a mine due to the failure of a joint venture partner to perform its obligations could result in significant fixed mine closure costs  including severance  employment legacy costs and other employment costs  reclamation and other environmental costs  and the costs of terminating long term obligations  including energy contracts and equipment leases 
we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners  especially when we have a minority interest in a joint venture and are not designated as the manager of the joint venture 
further  in spite of performing customary due diligence prior to entering into a joint venture  we cannot guaranty full disclosure of prior acts or omissions of the sellers or those with whom we enter into joint ventures 
such risks could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of our joint venture interests 

table of contents our expenditures for postretirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect  if there are mine closures or our joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations that relate to employee pension plans 
we provide defined benefit pension plans and opeb to eligible union and non union employees  including our share of expense and funding obligations with respect to unconsolidated ventures 
our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets  the projected and actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations  including the rate at which future obligations are discounted 
we cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions such as the current economic crisis  regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension expenses or our funding obligations  diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses 
we have calculated our unfunded pension and opeb obligations based on a number of assumptions 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially higher 
moreover  we cannot be certain that regulatory changes will not increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits 
these obligations also may increase substantially in the event of adverse medical cost trends or unexpected rates of early retirement  particularly for bargaining unit retirees for whom there is currently no retiree healthcare cost cap 
early retirement rates likely would increase substantially in the event of a mine closure 
our sales and competitive position depend on the ability to transport our products to our customers at competitive rates and in a timely manner 
disruption of the lake freighter and rail transportation services because of weather related problems  including ice and winter weather conditions on the great lakes  strikes  lock outs or other events  could impair our ability to supply iron ore pellets to our customers at competitive rates or in a timely manner and  thus  could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
similarly  our coal operations depend on international freighter and rail transportation services  as well as the availability of dock capacity  and any disruptions to such could impair our ability to supply coal to our customers at competitive rates or in a timely manner and  thus  could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
further  reduced levels of government funding may result in a lesser level of dredging  particularly at great lakes ports 
less dredging results in lower water levels  which restricts the tonnage freighters can haul over the great lakes  resulting in higher freight rates 
our asia pacific iron ore operations are in direct competition with the major world seaborne exporters of iron ore and our customers face higher transportation costs than most other australian producers to ship our products to the asian markets because of the location of our major shipping port on the south coast of australia 
further  increases in transportation costs  decreased availability of ocean vessels or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors  could make our products less competitive  restrict our access to certain markets and have an adverse effect on our sales  margins and profitability 
our operating expenses could increase significantly if the price of electrical power  fuel or other energy sources increases 
operating expenses at all of our mining locations are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices  including diesel fuel and natural gas prices 
in our north american iron ore locations  for example  these items make up approximately percent of our north american iron ore operating costs 
prices for electricity  natural gas and fuel oils can fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other users 
during periods of peak usage  supplies of energy may be curtailed and we may not be able to purchase them at historical rates 
while we have some long term contracts with electrical suppliers  we are exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our production costs 
we enter into forward fixed price supply contracts for natural gas and diesel fuel for use in our operations 
those contracts are of limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel needs  and price increases in fuel costs could cause our profitability to decrease significantly 

table of contents natural disasters  weather conditions  disruption of energy  unanticipated geological conditions  equipment failures  and other unexpected events may lead our customers  our suppliers  or our facilities to curtail production or shut down their operations 
operating levels within the industry are subject to unexpected conditions and events that are beyond the industry s control 
those events could cause industry members or their suppliers to curtail production or shut down a portion or all of their operations  which could reduce the demand for our iron ore and coal products  and could adversely affect our sales  margins  and profitability 
for example  in january of  one of our customers provided us with a force majeure letter due to a fire on the smaller of its two operating furnaces 
in february  severe weather conditions caused significant ice buildup in the basin supplying water to the hibbing facility tailings basin 
this caused a production shutdown that lowered first quarter production output 
in august and march  production at pinnacle slowed as a result of sandstone intrusions encountered within the coal panel being mined at the time  spreading fixed costs over less production than planned 
interruptions in production capabilities will inevitably increase our production costs and reduce our profitability 
we do not have meaningful excess capacity for current production needs  and we are not able to quickly increase production at one mine to offset an interruption in production at another mine 
a portion of our production costs are fixed regardless of current operating levels 
as noted  our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time 
these conditions include weather conditions for example  extreme winter weather  floods and availability of process water due to drought and natural disasters  pit wall failures  unanticipated geological conditions  including variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the deposits of iron ore and coal  variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geologic conditions and ore processing changes 
the manufacturing processes that take place in our mining operations  as well as in our processing facilities  depend on critical pieces of equipment 
this equipment may  on occasion  be out of service because of unanticipated failures 
in addition  many of our mines and processing facilities have been in operation for several decades  and the equipment is aged 
in the future  we may experience additional material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of equipment failures 
further  remediation of any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures that could have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows 
our business interruption insurance would not cover all of the lost revenues associated with equipment failures 
longer term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers  which could adversely affect our future sales levels  and therefore our profitability 
regarding the impact of unexpected events happening to our suppliers  many of our mines are dependent on one source for electric power and for natural gas 
for example  minnesota power  inc is the sole supplier of electric power to our hibbing and united taconite mines  wepco is the sole supplier of electric power to our tilden and empire mines  and our northshore mine is largely dependent on our wholly owned power facility for its electrical supply 
a significant interruption in service from our energy suppliers due to terrorism  weather conditions  natural disasters  or any other cause can result in substantial losses that may not be fully recoverable  either from our business interruption insurance or responsible third parties 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  which imposes  and will continue to impose  significant costs and liabilities on us  and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities or limit our ability to produce iron ore and coal products 
we are subject to various federal  provincial  state and local laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we have operations on matters such as employee health and safety  air quality  water pollution  plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining properties  the discharge of materials into the environment  and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability 
numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for our operations 
we cannot be certain that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

table of contents prior to commencement of mining  we must submit to and obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory authority of plans showing where and how mining and reclamation operations are to occur 
these plans must include information such as the location of mining areas  stockpiles  surface waters  haul roads  tailings basins and drainage from mining operations 
all requirements imposed by any such authority may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
in addition  new legislation and regulations and orders  including proposals related to climate change and protection of the environment  to which we would be subject or that would further regulate and tax our customers  namely the north american integrated steel producer customers  may also require us or our customers to reduce or otherwise change operations significantly or incur additional costs 
such new legislation  regulations or orders if enacted could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or profitability 
for example  our us operations are subject to mact emissions standards for particulate matter promulgated by the epa under the clean air act effective october  the epa s decision not to regulate emissions of mercury or asbestos in the mact rule is the subject of a court remand  and the outcome cannot be predicted 
further  we are subject to a variety of potential liability exposures arising at certain sites where we do not currently conduct operations 
these sites include sites where we formerly conducted iron ore mining or processing or other operations  inactive sites that we currently own  predecessor sites  acquired sites  leased land sites and third party waste disposal sites 
we may be named as a responsible party at other sites in the future and we cannot be certain that the costs associated with these additional sites will not be material 
we also could be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances used  released or disposed of by us or other environmental damage  including damage to natural resources 
in particular  we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various claims relating to the exposure of asbestos and silica to seamen who sailed on the great lakes vessels formerly owned and operated by certain of our subsidiaries 
the full impact of these claims  as well as whether insurance coverage will be sufficient and whether other defendants named in these claims will be able to fund any costs arising out of these claims  continues to be unknown 
underground mining is subject to increased safety regulation and may require us to incur additional cost 
recent mine disasters have led to the enactment and consideration of significant new federal and state laws and regulations relating to safety in underground coal mines 
these laws and regulations include requirements for constructing and maintaining caches for the storage of additional self contained self rescuers throughout underground mines  installing rescue chambers in underground mines  constant tracking of and communication with personnel in the mines  installing cable lifelines from the mine portal to all sections of the mine to assist in emergency escape  submission and approval of emergency response plans  and new and additional safety training 
additionally  new requirements for the prompt reporting of accidents and increased fines and penalties for violations of these and existing regulations have been implemented 
these new laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial additional costs  which may adversely impact our operating performance 
coal mining is complex due to geological characteristics of the region 
the geological characteristics of coal reserves  such as depth of overburden and coal seam thickness  make them complex and costly to mine 
as mines become depleted  replacement reserves may not be available when required or  if available  may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those characteristic of the depleting mines 
these factors could materially adversely affect the mining operations and cost structures of  and customers ability to use coal produced 
our profitability could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations 
the usw represents all hourly employees at our north american iron ore locations except for northshore 
the umwa represents hourly employees at our north american coal locations 
we have entered into an agreement with the usw on a new four year labor contract to replace the labor agreement that expired on september  and that will cover approximately  usw represented workers at our empire and tilden mines in michigan  and our united taconite and hibbing mines in minnesota 
a five year agreement runs until 
table of contents march  with our canadian work force 
the current umwa agreement runs through at our coal locations 
hourly employees at the railroads we own that transport products among our facilities are represented by multiple unions with labor agreements that expire at various dates 
if the collective bargaining agreements relating to the employees at our mines or railroads are not successfully renegotiated prior to their expiration  we could face work stoppages or labor strikes 
we may encounter labor shortages for critical operational positions  which could affect our ability to produce our products 
prior to the current global economic crisis  the global mining industry was facing a critical shortage of essential skilled employees 
competition for the available workers was limiting our ability to attract and retain employees prior to the global economic crisis 
despite the current economic downturn  we are predicting a long term shortage of skilled workers for the mining industry 
at many of our mining locations  many of our mining operational employees are approaching retirement age 
as these experienced employees retire  we may have difficulty replacing them at competitive wages 
as a result  wages are increasing to address the turnover 
in addition  when the global economy recovers  we will again be under increasing pressure to retain our existing skilled workers  also resulting in higher wages 
our profitability could be affected by the failure of outside contractors to perform 
portman and sonoma use contractors to handle many of the operational phases of their mining and processing operations and therefore are subject to the performance of outside companies on key production areas 
we may be unable to successfully identify  acquire and integrate strategic acquisition candidates 
our ability to grow successfully through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain necessary financing 
it is possible that we will be unable to successfully complete potential acquisitions 
in addition  the costs of acquiring other businesses could increase if competition for acquisition candidates increases 
additionally  the success of an acquisition is subject to other risks and uncertainties  including our ability to realize operating efficiencies expected from an acquisition  the size or quality of the resource  delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition  difficulties in retaining key employees  customers or suppliers of the acquired businesses  difficulties in maintaining uniform controls  procedures  standards and policies throughout acquired companies  the risks associated with the assumption of contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets  the impact of changes to our allocation of purchase price  and the ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing 
we are subject to risks involving operations in multiple countries 
we have a strategy to broaden our scope as a supplier of iron ore and other raw materials to the global integrated steel industry 
as we expand beyond our traditional north american base business  we will be subject to additional risks beyond those risks relating to our north american operations  such as currency fluctuations  legal and tax limitations on our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner  potential negative international impacts resulting from us foreign and domestic policies  including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions  the imposition of duties  tariffs  import and export controls and other trade barriers impacting the seaborne iron ore and coal markets  difficulties in staffing and managing multi national operations  and uncertainties in the enforcement of legal rights and remedies in multiple jurisdictions 
if we are unable to manage successfully the risks associated with expanding our global business  these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of market risks 
market risks include those caused by changes in the value of equity investments  changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates

risk factors 
mine capacity and ore reserves reserves are defined by sec industry standard guide as that part of a mineral deposit that could be economically and legally extracted and produced at the time of the reserve determination 
all reserves are classified as proven or probable and are supported by life of mine plans 
iron ore reserves ore reserve estimates for our iron ore mines as of december  were estimated from fully designed open pits developed using three dimensional modeling techniques 
these fully designed pits incorporate design slopes  practical mining shapes and access ramps to assure the accuracy of our reserve estimates

estimated standard equivalent pellets  including both proven and probable reserves based on life of mine operating schedules 
we regularly evaluate our reserve estimates and update them in accordance with sec industry guide northshore annual capacity increased in from million through reactivation of idled concentrating and pelletizing plant sections 

table of contents in  there were no changes in reserve estimates at northshore or united taconite  except for production 
new economic reserve analyses were performed at empire  tilden  hibbing and wabush in each of the new reserve analyses incorporate updates to both iron ore pellet pricing and operating costs 
changes in the reserve estimates are as follows empire pellet reserves are increased by million tons net of production 
the increased reserves are obtained by an additional pit pushback 
tilden pellet reserves are increased by million tons net of production 
the increased reserves are obtained by an additional pit pushback of the hematite main pit 
hibbing pellet reserves are decreased by million tons net of production 
the decreased reserves are due to the inability of life of mine scheduling to accommodate all low recovery ores while maintaining an million ton annual pellet production rate 
the previous ore reserve estimate for hibbing taconite was based on a million ton operating rate that allowed maximum utilization of these ores 
wabush pellet reserves were increased by million tons net of production 
the increased reserves are obtained by optimizing manganese cut off grades for pellet specifications and operational improvements in pit dewatering allowing for deeper pit designs

general information about the mines leases 
mining is conducted on multiple mineral leases having varying expiration dates 
mining leases are routinely renegotiated and renewed as they approach their respective expiration dates 
exploration and development 
all iron ore mining operations are open pit mines that are in production 
additional pit development is underway at each mine as required by long range mine plans 
at our north american iron ore mines  drilling programs are conducted periodically for the purpose of refining guidance related to ongoing operations 
the biwabik  negaunee  and wabush iron formations are classified as lake superior type iron formations that formed under similar sedimentary conditions in shallow marine basins approximately two billion years ago 
magnetite and hematite are the predominant iron oxide ore minerals present  with lesser amounts of goethite and limonite 
chert is the predominant waste mineral present  with lesser amounts of silicate and carbonate minerals 
the ore minerals liberate from the waste minerals upon fine grinding 
all north american coal mine operations are underground mines that are in production 
drilling programs are conducted periodically for the purpose of refining guidance related to ongoing operations 
the pocahontas no and blue creek coal seams are pennsylvanian age low ash  high quality coals 

table of contents at koolyanobbing  an exploration program targeting extensions to the iron ore resource base as well as regional exploration targets in the yilgarn mineral field was active in and continued in at cockatoo island  feasibility studies have been completed for a below sea level eastward mine pit extension

item legal proceedings 
alabama dust litigation 
in and  two cases white  et al 
v 
usx corporation  et al  and weekley  et al 
v 
usx corporation  et al 
were brought alleging that dust from the concord coal preparation plant damaged properties in the area 
in  the parties entered into settlement agreements with the former owner in exchange for a lump sum payment and the agreement to implement remedial measures 
however  the plaintiffs were not required to dismiss their claims 
pinnoak was added to these cases in and the plaintiffs in both these matters sought additional remediation measures  and we opposed that request 
the parties have reached agreement on an amendment to the settlement of the white matter  which on december   was approved by the court 
the terms of the amendment provide that in exchange for an immaterial amount as payment for attorneys fees and costs and the implementation of a one year ambient air monitoring plan  which could lengthen to months under certain circumstances  plaintiffs agreed to release and dismiss us from the lawsuit upon successful completion of the ambient air monitoring plan 
if the ambient air monitoring plan is not successfully completed  the parties will revert to their respective positions under the settlement agreement 
the weekley case is currently pending before the supreme court of alabama on a petition for writ of mandamus  arguing that the case should be dismissed in light of the white class action settlement 
in addition to the two cases noted above  in approximately individual plaintiffs brought an action against pinnoak asserting injuries arising from particulate emissions from the concord preparation plant 
we are seeking a summary judgment in this most recent matter because it had previously been concluded under the settlement agreement 
in  in gamble  et al 
v 
pinnoak resources  llc  et al  plaintiffs brought an action against pinnoak related to the operation of the concord coal preparation plant 
these plaintiffs asserted that dangerous levels of coal dust emissions had been allowed to accumulate at that facility 
we denied this allegation  and on april   the united states district court for the northern district of alabama  southern division  dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of standing on the part of the plaintiffs 

table of contents american steamship litigation 
one of our subsidiaries  cliffs sales company  currently contracts with american steamship company  or asc  for the transportation of iron ore pellets from various ports on the great lakes to a blast furnace ore dock in cleveland  ohio 
there are nine years remaining on that contract and we filed suit against asc on february  alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims for damages in connection with overcharges by asc for fuel adjustments 
we also requested declaratory relief for the fuel adjustment provisions of the contract as well as with respect to asc s obligation to shuttle iron ore 
on may   asc filed its own action against cliffs sales company and adding northshore mining company and oglebay norton marine services company  llc  as parties 
asc requested declaratory relief stating that its fuel adjustment charges were proper and that it had no obligation to shuttle iron ore during the winter 
asc also requested damages in connection with an alleged anticipatory breach of the contract based on our breach of contract claims 
both cases were consolidated for purposes of discovery 
on may   a jury returned a verdict in favor of cliffs sales company with respect to overcharges for fuel adjustments 
the jury awarded cliffs sales company damages totaling million 
it was determined that oglebay norton was responsible for million of the damages and asc was responsible for the remaining million of damages to us 
the jury stated that asc could only charge an additional half cent fuel surcharge on shuttles to a blast furnace ore dock in cleveland  ohio when the ore was delivered to cleveland bulk terminal by a non asc vessel 
the jury found against cliffs sales company finding that asc was not obligated to provide winter shuttle service 
cliffs sales company filed a motion for the payment of interest on the amounts due to cliffs sales company  as well as for our costs for trying 
asc and oglebay norton s motions for new trial and for judgment as a matter of law were denied 
asc and oglebay norton have both agreed not to file an appeal 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded and received payment for the million of damages 
arcelormittal arbitrations 
on march   arcelormittal filed two demands for arbitration with the aaa with respect to the march  umbrella agreement between arcelormittal and some of our operations 
in one demand for arbitration  arcelormittal alleged that we had breached the umbrella agreement by refusing to honor arcelormittal s attempt to revise its nomination for an additional  gross tons of iron ore pellets for export to arcelormittal facilities located outside of the united states 
in the other demand for arbitration  arcelormittal requested a ruling from the aaa that  under the terms of the umbrella agreement  arcelormittal may transfer iron ore pellets purchased in and under the umbrella agreement to any iron and steel making facility owned directly or indirectly by mittal steel company nv on december   the arbitration panel ruled on both arbitrations 
the arbitration panel ruled in our favor in the first arbitration  ruling that we did not breach the umbrella agreement with respect to arcelormittal s attempt to revise their nomination 
in the second arbitration  the arbitration panel ruled in arcelormittal s favor  ruling that arcelormittal may transfer iron ore pellets purchased in and under the umbrella agreement to any iron and steel making facility owned directly or indirectly by mittal steel company nv maritime asbestos litigation 
as previously disclosed  the cleveland cliffs iron company and or the cleveland cliffs steamship company have been named defendants in actions brought from to date by former seamen in which the plaintiffs claim damages under federal law for illnesses allegedly suffered as the result of exposure to airborne asbestos fibers while serving as crew members aboard the vessels previously owned or managed by our entities until the mid s 
all of these actions have been consolidated into multidistrict proceedings in the eastern district of pennsylvania  whose docket now includes a total of over  maritime cases filed by seamen against ship owners and other defendants 
all of these cases have been dismissed without prejudice  but can be reinstated upon application by plaintiffs counsel 
the claims against our entities are insured in amounts that vary by policy year  however  the manner in which these retentions will be applied remains uncertain 
our entities continue to vigorously contest these claims and have made no settlements on them

a notice of appeal was filed  but no briefs have been filed to date 
northshore air permit matters 
on december   northshore submitted an application to the mpca for an administrative amendment to its air pollution operating permit 
the proposed amendment requested the deletion of a term in the air permit that was derived from a court case brought against the silver bay taconite operations in the permit term incorporated elements of the court ordered requirement to reduce fiber emissions to below a medically significant level by installing controls that would be deemed adequate if the fiber levels in silver bay were below those of a control city such as st 
paul 
we requested deletion of this control city permit requirement on the grounds that the court ordered requirements had been satisfied more than years ago and should no longer be included in the permit 
the mpca denied our application on february  we appealed the denial to the minnesota court of appeals 
the court of appeals ruled in mpca s favor 
subsequent to the court of appeals ruling  northshore filed a major permit amendment on august  to remove the control city requirement from its permit 
the permit amendment is currently pending 
subsequent to the filing of the major permit amendment  the mpca alleged that northshore was in violation of the control city standard based on new data that the mpca collected showing that current fiber levels in st 
paul were lower than in silver bay for a period in northshore filed a motion with the us district court for the district of minnesota to re open the original reserve mining case  requesting that the court declare the control city standard satisfied and the court s injunction voided  or if the control city standard remained in effect  clarify that it was a fixed standard set at the level rather than a moving standard  referred to as the federal suit 
shortly thereafter  the save lake superior association and the sierra club filed a lawsuit in us district court for the district of minnesota with respect to alleged violations of the control city standard  referred to as the citizens suit 
on september   the court granted northshore s motion to stay the citizen s suit pending resolution of the federal suit 
a joint stipulation for dismissal with prejudice of the citizens suit is pending before the court 
the court entered an order in the federal suit on december   concluding that the federal court injunction from the case no longer had any force or effect 
however  the court s order also stated that the control city standard was a state permit requirement that can only be addressed in state court 
while the determination that the federal injunction no longer has any effect is favorable  northshore is currently analyzing the implications of the federal court order with respect to northshore s operating permit and pending state appeal 
on february   northshore filed an appeal of certain aspects of the federal court s order 
on july   the mpca issued a nov to northshore alleging violations related to the control city standard for the period of march through october  specifically with respect to mpca s interpretation of the control city standard s emission limits and related monitoring and reporting requirements 
the nov states that northshore has been in compliance with mpca s interpretation of the standard since october  but requires corrective actions relating to operating and maintaining facilities of treatment and control to remain in compliance 
although the nov does not seek civil penalties  it contains various requests for information and reserves the right for mpca to take further action 
northshore disputes the allegations contained in the nov and is currently assessing its legal and administrative options 
northshore filed a major permit amendment on august  requesting the removal of all fiber related provisions from northshore s air permit and proposing that northshore install additional particulate controls 
mpca issued a findings of fact  conclusions of law and order on november  declaring that northshore s request to remove the control city standard from its permit constitutes a project for which an eaw must be completed 
mpca also stated that it was ceasing all other work on the permit  including its own efforts to create a replacement standard  until the environmental review process was complete 
northshore had days from the date it received the mpca s order in which to challenge these determinations through a declaratory judgment  which it has done 

table of contents additionally  in october  northshore received the final results of the international symposium on the health hazard evaluation of fibrous particles associated with taconite and the adjacent duluth complex 
the peer reviewed study concluded that there are no significant health effects related to fibers from northshore 
northshore filed an action to challenge the mpca s requirement for an eaw in minnesota state district court  which is currently pending 
if either our appeal is unsuccessful or if we are unable to negotiate an acceptable compliance schedule  northshore could be subject to future enforcement actions with respect to its title v operating permit if we are unable to meet the permit requirements as interpreted by mpca 
additionally  as part of northshore s permitting of the restart of furnace  northshore is required to certify compliance with air emission standards within days of operation 
during the scheduled compliance testing for furnace  northshore experienced abnormal operating difficulties and was thereby unable to certify compliance 
northshore received a notice of noncompliance from mpca on december  indicating it considers the facility out of compliance with the testing schedule and reserves the right to enforcement  while asking for additional explanation as to the related causes 
due to changes in market demand  furnace has been idled 
northshore expects that upon restart it will demonstrate compliance with the required limits and will perform retesting as soon as furnace returns to normal operating conditions 
accordingly  at that time  northshore will take appropriate steps to establish compliance with mpca 
republic arbitration 
on october   we entered into an agreement for the sale of pellets with republic engineered products  inc republic 
pursuant to that agreement republic was required to purchase a percentage of its iron ore requirements from us 
republic is required to provide us with a firm nomination by a certain date each year 
as of the end of republic had failed to take delivery and pay for a portion of the gross tons remaining from its nomination 
after several failed attempts at negotiating a workout agreement  we filed a demand for arbitration on february  for a total of million plus interest  commencing december  the rio tinto mine site 
the rio tinto mine site is a historic underground copper mine located near mountain city  nevada  where tailings were placed in mill creek  a tributary to the owyhee river 
site investigation and remediation work is being conducted in accordance with a consent order between the nevada dep and the rtwg composed of cliffs  atlantic richfield company  teck cominco american incorporated  and e 
i 
du pont de nemours and company 
the consent order provides for technical review by the us department of the interior bureau of indian affairs  the us fish wildlife service  us department of agriculture forest service  the ndep and the shoshone paiute tribes of the duck valley reservation collectively  rio tinto trustees 
the consent order is currently projected to continue with the objective of supporting the selection of the final remedy for the site 
costs are shared pursuant to the terms of a participation agreement between the parties of the rtwg  who have reserved the right to renegotiate any future participation or cost sharing following the completion of the consent order 
the rio tinto trustees have made available for public comment their plans for the assessment of nrd 
the rtwg commented on the plans and also are in discussions with the rio tinto trustees informally about those plans 
the notice of plan availability is a step in the damage assessment process 
the studies presented in the plan may lead to a nrd claim under cercla 
there is no monetized nrd claim at this time 
during  the focus of the rtwg was on development of alternatives for remediation of the mine site 
a draft of an alternatives study was reviewed with ndep  the epa and the rio tinto trustees and the alternatives have essentially been reduced to the following tailings stabilization and long term water treatment  and removal of the tailings 
as of december   the estimated costs of the available remediation alternatives currently range from approximately million to million 
in recognition of the potential for an nrd claim  the parties are actively pursuing a global settlement that would include the epa and encompass both the remedial action and the nrd issues 
in  the rtwg parties met for formal mediation on two occasions to resolve differences over the allocation of any negotiated remedy 
the mediation resulted in substantial progress  and the members of the rtwg are still negotiating an allocation 
additionally  the rtwg and rtag met most recently in december to discuss appropriate terms for a global settlement based on the latest investigation results 
while a global settlement has not been finalized  we expect an agreement will be reached in we have increased our reserve most recently in by million to reflect revised cleanup

consolidated revenues for increased to billion  with net income of per diluted share 
this compares with revenues of billion and net income of per diluted share in global crude steel growth  a significant driver of our business was down approximately two percent from with supply and demand of steel raw materials extremely tight 
worldwide demand for metallurgical coal increased throughout most of as supply side constraints  including flooding in the bowen basin  a major coal producing area of australia  port congestion  and production problems at large mines in the united states continue to place upward pressure on pricing 
however  the current volatility and uncertainty in global markets  coupled with the slowdown in the world s major economies  has had a significant impact on commodity prices 
the mining industry has seen a reduction in high cost operations  and the credit environment is expected to limit the funding and expansion capabilities of many mining companies 
based on these economic conditions  we continue to evaluate and assess our capital expenditures  in order to ensure we are positioned to face the challenges and uncertainties associated with the current environment 
we reacted quickly to align production with lower demand for steel and steelmaking materials entering the fourth quarter of while remaining attuned to current macroeconomic challenges  we continue to seek low risk expansion opportunities and  at the same time  position ourselves to weather any difficult times that lie ahead

this compares with revenues of billion and net income of per diluted share in revenue from product sales and services sales revenue in increased billion  or percent  compared with the increase in sales revenue was primarily due to higher sales prices combined with increases in sales volume 
higher sales volume in was primarily due to increased demand and commitments under our long term pellet sales agreements  increased spot sales  and customer plant outages during the prior year 
however  this increase was partially offset by declines in sales volumes to customers during the fourth quarter of as a result of the current volatility and uncertainty in global markets  which has led to production slowdowns in the steel industry 
in addition  sales volume was negatively impacted throughout the year by adverse mining conditions and production delays at our north american coal segment 
results for north american coal in represent five months of operations since the july  acquisition 
revenues related to our north american iron ore segment increased approximately million over the prior year primarily as a result of higher steel prices  renegotiated and new long term supply agreements with certain customers  which were negotiated at world pellet prices  and other contractual price adjustment factors

previously  when the derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges  the mark to market adjustments related to the effective portions of the hedges were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
upon de designation of the cash flow hedges  effective july   the instruments are prospectively marked to fair value  and the adjustments resulting from changes in the market value of these derivative instruments are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss each reporting period

aud call options are excluded from the weighted average exchange rate used for the remainder of the contract portfolio due to the unlimited downside participation associated with these instruments 

table of contents the significant unrealized mark to market fluctuations are related to the spot rate of a as of december   which significantly decreased from the spot rate of a as of june  upon de designation of the hedges 
the changes in the spot rates are correlated to the depreciation of the australian dollar relative to the united states dollar during the period 
in addition  the amount of outstanding contracts in portman s foreign exchange hedge book significantly increased from million at june  to approximately million as of december   primarily as a result of higher sales prices in the current year partially offset by the expiration of contracts upon maturity 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to declines in the fair value of our available for sale securities which we concluded were other than temporary 
as of december   our investments in polymet and golden west had fair values totaling million and million  respectively  compared with a cost of million and million  respectively 
the metals and mining industry and our investees are susceptible to changes in the us and global economies and the industries of their customers 
their principal customers are part of the global steel industry  and their businesses have been adversely affected by the slowdown of the global economy  particularly during the last quarter of when our investments became impaired 
the severity of the impairments in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments is consistent with the macroeconomic market and industry developments 
however  we have evaluated the near term prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and rapid decline in the fair value of each of these investments  and based upon that evaluation  we could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary primarily as a result of the global economic crisis and the corresponding uncertainties in the market 
the increase in interest income in compared with is attributable to additional cash and investments held by portman during the year coupled with higher overall average returns 
however  investment returns were lower in the fourth quarter of as a result of market declines 
higher interest expense in reflected increased borrowings under our senior notes and interest accretion for the deferred payment related to the pinnoak acquisition 
see note debt and credit facilities for further information 
income taxes our tax provision for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to higher pre tax book income partially offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  and was percent and percent  respectively 
the percent decrease is primarily attributable to increased percentage depletion and release of the valuation allowance related to foreign net operating losses 
see note income taxes for further information 
minority interest minority interest in consolidated income increased million  or percent  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily driven by a corresponding increase in the operating results of portman  a consolidated subsidiary in which we owned approximately percent in and throughout the first half of in june  we acquired an additional percent interest in portman through a share repurchase program offered by portman 
we subsequently made an off market offer to purchase the outstanding shares and proceeded with a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares to obtain full ownership of portman in the fourth quarter of in addition  effective july   we acquired the remaining percent interest in united taconite 
upon consummation of the purchase  our ownership interest increased from percent to percent 
each of these transactions constituted a step acquisition of a non controlling interest  thereby reducing minority interest in consolidated income on a prospective basis 
in accordance with sfas  business combinations  we accounted for the acquisition of the minority interests by the purchase method 
as a result of each step acquisition  the then historical cost basis of the minority interest balance was reduced to the extent of the percentage interest sold  and the increased ownership obtained was accounted for by increasing the entity s basis from historical cost to fair value for the portion of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the additional ownership acquired 

table of contents equity loss in ventures the equity loss in ventures for the year ended december  of million primarily represents our share of the operating results of our equity method investment in amap 
such results mainly consist of start up and operating losses of million  which includes operating losses from amap s railroad of million 
the loss was partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains of million 
this compares with a loss of million in  comprised of million in pre production costs and million of operating losses from the railroad 
the negative operating results in the current year are mainly due to slower than anticipated ramp up of operations and product yields 
we evaluate the loss in value of our equity method investments each reporting period to determine whether the loss is other than temporary 
based upon the increase in equity losses resulting from start up costs and production delays in  we determined that indicators of impairment may exist relative to our investment in amap 
accordingly  we performed an assessment of the potential impairment of our investment during the fourth quarter of using a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of our investment in relation to its carrying value as of december  based upon the analysis performed  we have determined that our investment is not impaired 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate the results of our investment on a quarterly basis while monitoring the declines in pricing and the potential impact on our business as a result of the recent economic downturn in the industry

first half shipments in included million tons of pellets purchased in upper great lakes stockpiles and paid for in revenue recognition related to the december stockpile transaction totaling million was deferred until the product was delivered in the completion of a two million tonne per annum expansion at koolyanobbing in late also resulted in increased sales volume in related to our asia pacific iron ore segment

production following is a summary of iron ore production tonnage for and in millions company share total mine empire tilden hibbing northshore united taconite wabush total long tons of pellets  pounds 
the decrease in production at empire compared with the prior year is primarily due to empire processing tilden ore to produce million tons of pellets under a test period 
the corresponding increase is reflected at tilden  bringing total production to million tons compared with million tons in the increase in hibbing s production in compared with was a result of the shutdown in late february due to severe weather conditions that caused significant buildup of ice in the basin supplying water to the processing facility 
the full year production loss in totaled approximately million tons company share million tons 
the increase in production in at northshore was due to reactivation of one of the furnaces at the end of march accordingly  production at northshore benefited from an incremental increase of approximately million tons in and is expected to benefit from an increase of million tons of annual capacity thereafter 
this increase was partially offset by production curtailments totaling million tons in the fourth quarter from idling pellet furnaces in response to production slowdowns in the steel industry 
the increase in our share of production at united taconite is primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining percent interest in july united taconite s production was reduced by million tons in the fourth quarter from idling a pellet furnace in response to production slowdowns in the steel industry 
in december  we executed plans to reduce production at our six north american iron ore mines to approximately million equity tons 
this compares with production of million equity tons 
in order to implement the lower production levels  we have temporarily idled various pellet furnaces and initiated workforce adjustments at each of our north american iron ore mines

in addition  we declared force majeure on customer shipments from our pinnacle mine in mid march production at the mine slowed as a result of encountering a fault area within the coal panel being mined at the time 
the force majeure was lifted in mid june 
despite completion of a longwall move in june  our oak grove mine continued to experience delays and lower than planned production levels during the second half of the mine encountered lower than planned coal heights in the current mining panel and harsh geological conditions in the development areas 
additional costs have also been incurred for repairs and maintenance as a result of mechanical problems caused by adverse geological conditions  delays associated with equipment replacements and availability of experienced mining personnel 
oak grove decreased production in the fourth quarter to enable continuous miners to prepare longwall panels 
one of our green ridge facilities  located in the pinnacle complex  has shut down production in an effort to focus on mining the remaining other green ridge location  resulting in lower overall production for the facility 
we continue to be challenged with adverse geological conditions across the mines and delays in delivery of new capital equipment  which have contributed to overall equipment performance and availability issues  which increased costs in all operations

in august  production at our pinnacle mine in west virginia slowed as a result of sandstone intrusions encountered within the coal panel being mined at the time 
this slowdown prompted the operating decision in late september to move the mine s longwall plow system to another panel 
in mid october  the plow system was brought back into production 
in addition  we had invested in business improvement initiatives and safety activities designed to enhance future production at our oak grove mine 
these investments reduced our production 
the slowdown and resulting lack of leverage over fixed costs  such as labor and energy  contributed to a loss of sales margin and unusually high per ton costs of goods sold

while this will have a detrimental impact on cash flow and earnings in those quarters  we do not expect it to create any liquidity issues  nor do we expect any adverse impact on our debt covenants 
assuming current projected volumes  our liquidity appears to be sufficient  and we will maintain ample room under our debt covenants for several credit markets may provide additional capacity should that become necessary 
the bank market may provide funding through a term loan or through exercising the million accordion in our credit facility 
in october  we were able to obtain approximately billion in commitments from the bank market as part of the funding for the proposed acquisition of alpha natural resources 
the risk associated with this market is that decreasing capacity has lead to significant increases in borrowing costs

capacity in the bond market appears to be rebounding slowly for investment grade companies 
longer term debt arrangements at current corporate bond rates must be aligned with our longer term capital structure needs

shareholder dilution is a significant determining factor in deciding whether to access this market  in addition to considering how this alternative would align with our longer term capital structure 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets  undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments  or undertaken any obligation arising our of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company

refer to note commitments and contingencies for additional information regarding our guarantees 
market risks we are subject to a variety of risks  including those caused by changes in the market value of equity investments  changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have established policies and procedures to manage such risks  however  certain risks are beyond our control 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in australia as a result of our operations at portman and sonoma  which could impact our financial condition 
foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the united states dollar 
portman hedges a portion of its united states currency denominated sales in accordance with a formal policy 
the primary objective for using derivative financial instruments is to reduce the volatility attributable to changes in australian and united states currency fluctuations 
the instruments were subject to formal documentation  intended to achieve qualifying hedge treatment  and were tested at inception and at each reporting period as to effectiveness 
effective july   portman discontinued hedge accounting for these derivatives  but continues to hold these instruments as economic hedges to manage currency risk 
upon de designation of the cash flow hedges  the instruments are prospectively marked to fair value each reporting period through changes in fair value of derivative instruments  net on the statement of consolidated operations 
at december   portman had approximately million of outstanding exchange rate contracts in the form of call options  collar options  convertible collar options and forward exchange contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from january to august a percent increase in the value of the australian dollar from the month end rate would increase the fair value by approximately million  and a percent decrease would reduce the fair value by approximately million 
we are required to record on our statements of consolidated financial position the market value of our open derivative positions which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
the gain or loss resulting from changes in the market value of these derivative instruments is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss each reporting period 
these mark to market adjustments are recorded as non operating costs on the statements of consolidated operations 

table of contents our share of pellets produced at the wabush operation in canada represents approximately five percent of our north american iron ore pellet production 
this operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the united states and canadian currency  however  we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation 
under the majority ownership of mmx  amap s functional currency was previously determined to be the brazilian real 
the analysis performed to determine the functional currency at the time indicated a mixed outcome assessment of the pertinent determining economic factors as set forth under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation sfas  including  for example  sales being priced in u 
s 
dollars and operating costs being largely incurred in brazilian real 
the change in control of amap to anglo in august resulted in the review of financial  operating and treasury policies of the entity under new management 
this  along with recent efforts to mitigate exposures related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in the reassessment of the accounting principles related to the determination of amap s functional currency during the fourth quarter of as a result  effective october   we changed the functional currency of amap from the local currency to the us dollar reporting currency primarily due to changes in the debt structure under which the entity is financed as well as changes in the treasury  risk mitigation and financial reporting policies under which the entity s operations are managed  resulting in the us dollar becoming the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates

interest rate risk interest for borrowings under our credit facility is at a floating rate  dependent in part on the libor rate  which exposes us to the effects of interest rate changes 
based on million in outstanding revolving and term loans at december   with a floating interest rate and no corresponding fixed rate swap  a basis point change to the libor rate would result in a change of million to interest expense on an annual basis 
in october  we entered into a million fixed rate swap to convert a portion of this floating rate into a fixed rate 
with the swap agreement  we pay a fixed three month libor rate for million of our floating rate borrowings 
the interest rate swap terminates in october and qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
pricing risks the current global economic crisis has resulted in increasing downward pressure from customers  particularly in china  for a roll back of the price increases for seaborne iron ore and metallurgical coal in the record price increase was driven by high demand for iron ore and coking coal  global steel production at historically high levels  combined with production and logistics constraints for both iron ore and coking coal  resulting in tight supply conditions 
with the current global economic crisis  none of these conditions exist in early  and the market now is characterized by a collapse in steel demand and limited global demand for iron ore and coking coal 
reduced demand for iron ore and coking coal will likely result in decreased demand for our products and decreasing prices  resulting in lower revenue levels in  and decreasing margins as a result of decreased production  adversely affecting our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
nonperformance and liquidity risks the current global economic crisis has adversely affected our business and could impact our financial results 
all of our customers have announced curtailments of production  which has adversely affected the demand for our iron ore and coal products 
continuation or worsening of the current economic conditions  a prolonged global  national or regional economic recession or other events that could produce major changes in demand patterns  could have a material adverse effect on our sales  margins and profitability 
we are not able to predict the impact the current global economic crisis will have on our operations and the industry in general going forward 

table of contents in addition  consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers  some of which are highly leveraged 
these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk 
current credit markets are highly volatile  and some of our customers are highly leveraged 
a significant adverse change in the financial and or credit position of a customer could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer and could limit our ability to collect receivables 
failure to receive payment from our customers for products that we have delivered could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our investment policy relating to short term investments is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the short term return through investment of available funds 
the carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates 
we commonly use aaa rated money market funds for short term investments 
on september   we received notice that one of the money market funds  in which we had million invested  was suspending all cash redemptions and redeeming a combination of cash and in kind securities until december   when all of the fund s securities matured 
the investment was redeemed in cash for full value on december  all other money market funds we invested in maintained daily cash redemptions throughout approximately percent of our us pension trust assets and percent of veba assets are exposed to sub prime risk  all of which are investment grade and fully collateralized by properties 
these investments primarily include mortgage backed securities and the home equity subset of the asset backed securities sector with aaa and aa credit quality ratings 
due to the continuing liquidity crisis in the us  the spreads of these structures have widened and  as a result  their market values have declined 
however  the over collateralization of these arrangements is expected to mitigate the potential for principal loss in these tranches 
as evidence  there has been no material impairment in these securities as of december  the us pension and veba trusts have no allocations to mortgage related collateralized debt obligations 
volatile energy and fuel costs the volatile cost of energy and supplies is an important issue affecting our production costs  primarily in relation to our iron ore operations 
recent trends have shown that although electric power  natural gas  and oil costs are declining  the direction and magnitude of short term changes are difficult to predict 
our consolidated north american iron ore mining ventures consumed approximately million mmbtu s of natural gas at an average delivered price of per mmbtu  and million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of per gallon in consumption of diesel fuel by our asia pacific operations was approximately million gallons for the same period 
as of december  we have million mmbtu s of natural gas  representing approximately percent of our natural gas requirements  purchased forward at an average price of per mmbtu 
we also have million gallons of diesel fuel  representing approximately percent of our requirements  purchased forward at per gallon for our north american iron ore mining ventures 
such contracts are a means to limit our exposure to potential future market price increases 
our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuels 
our north american iron ore mining ventures enter into forward contracts for certain commodities  primarily natural gas and diesel fuel  as a hedge against price volatility 
such contracts are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process 
at december   the notional amount of the outstanding forward contracts was million  with an unrecognized fair value net loss of million based on december  forward rates 
the contracts mature at various times through december if the forward rates were to change percent from the month end rate  the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately million 
outlook given the current macroeconomic environment and the impact on demand for steelmaking raw materials in the intermediate term  our priority in is to generate and preserve cash in order to maintain our high degree of financial flexibility 
while our company s management team has taken swift action to bring production levels at all of our businesses in line with current demand  a great deal of uncertainty remains in the marketplace

these commitments  combined with eventual revenue recognition of million tons deferred in  total approximately million tons of sales volume for this sales volume total assumes we will recognize bill and hold sales  which are anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of in addition  based on current market uncertainties and corresponding blast furnace capacity utilization in north america  we must continue to monitor the marketplace as well as the financial health of our customers 
with annual price settlements for iron ore in not yet concluded  we are unable to provide guidance on average revenue per ton in our north american iron ore business segment 
we previously indicated our average revenue per ton in will benefit from contractual base price adjustments  lag year adjustments and price caps and floors contained in most of our current supply agreements 
actual realized average revenue per ton will ultimately depend on sales volume levels  world pellet prices  production input costs and or steel prices  all of which are factors in our formula based pricing for the north american iron ore business segment 
at the current annualized production rate for our north american iron ore business segment  cost per ton is expected to be between and the expected increase from cost per ton is the result of reduced leverage over fixed costs resulting from lower year over year production levels 
north american coal outlook we begin with approximately million tons of coal under contractual obligation  or approximately percent of our current annualized production rate 
this coal is priced at an average of per ton  which includes production earmarks to fulfill obligations for tons deferred as a result of past production disruptions 
with negotiations for international met coal contracts not yet concluded  we are unable to provide guidance for uncommitted production related to our north american coal business segment 
currently there is no precise indication where prices will settle for the high quality  low volatility coal that we produce

per tonne costs at sonoma are expected to be between and the increase from cost per ton levels is the result of an anticipated special royalty payment under an agreement with our partner  qcoal  that occurs when the mine exceeds a certain performance threshold 
amap iron ore project update in the third quarter of  our new partner in the amap project  anglo  closed its acquisition of mmx s percent share of the project and assumed management control over the venture 
throughout the year  the ramp up of operations was significantly slower than previously anticipated  with annual production totaling million tonnes

however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition north american iron ore revenue is recognized on the sale of products when title to the product has transferred to the customer in accordance with the specified provisions of each term supply agreement and all applicable criteria for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
most of our north american iron ore term supply agreements provide that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when payment is received 
this is a practice utilized to reduce our financial risk to customer insolvency 
under some term supply agreements  we ship the product to ports on the lower great lakes or to the customer s facilities prior to the transfer of title 
our rationale for shipping iron ore products to some customers and retaining title until payment is received for these products is to minimize credit risk exposure 
we recorded revenue of million in the fourth quarter of related to sales to customers under minimum purchase requirements of supply agreements  who had paid for the iron ore but requested that we not ship the product until the spring of  when the great lakes waterways re open for shipping 
this compares to million of revenue recorded under similar arrangements in the fourth quarter of these bill and hold sales were made pursuant to long term contracts that include annual take or pay arrangements 
critical estimates and other factors related to the recognition of revenue on these stockpile sales include the freezing weather conditions on the great lakes and the existence of a fixed delivery schedule that is reflective of the customer s historical stockpile shipment requests 
in  certain customers purchased and paid for million tons of pellets in upper lakes stockpiles in order to meet minimum contractual purchase requirements 
at the request of the customers  the ore was not shipped 
we considered whether revenue should be recognized on these sales under the bill and hold guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
topic  however  since fixed shipment schedules were not established prior to year end  revenue recognition on these transactions  totaling million  was deferred and will be recognized upon shipment in 
table of contents most of our north american iron ore long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors 
these price adjustment factors vary based on the agreement but typically include adjustments based upon changes in international pellet prices  changes in specified producers price indices including those for all commodities  industrial commodities  energy and steel 
the adjustments generally operate in the same manner  with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment  although the weighting of each factor varies based upon the specific terms of each agreement 
one of our term supply agreements contains price collars  which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any given year 
in most cases  these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold  we routinely estimate these adjustment factors 
the price adjustment factors have been evaluated to determine if they contain embedded derivatives 
we evaluated the embedded derivatives in the supply agreements in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
the price adjustment factors share the same economic characteristics and risks as the host contract and are integral to the host contract as inflation adjustments  accordingly they have not been separately valued as derivative instruments 
in addition  certain supply agreements with one customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer s annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnaces 
we account for this provision as a derivative instrument at the time of sale and record this provision at fair value until the year the product is consumed and the amounts are settled as an adjustment to revenue 
as part of the agreement to acquire the remaining percent interest in united taconite  effective july   we committed approximately million tons of iron ore pellets  which are to be provided through september this commitment represents an obligation to deliver the pellets as additional consideration for the remaining interest in united taconite 
the pellets were initially valued at million  based upon the eastern canadian pellet price at the time of acquisition  and the additional consideration is recorded as current derivative liabilities on the statement of consolidated financial position until the pellets are delivered 
the purchase agreement contains a penalty provision in the event the million tons of pellets are not delivered by a specified date 
the penalty provision  which is not a fixed amount or a fixed amount per unit  causes net settlement in this arrangement  and therefore causes the obligation to be accounted for as a derivative instrument  which is based on the future eastern canadian pellet price 
the instrument is marked to fair value each reporting period until the pellets are delivered and the amounts are settled 
in  we recognized million as product revenues on the statements of consolidated operations upon shipment of million tons of iron ore pellets 
the derivative liability associated with the undelivered pellets was reduced by a mark to market adjustment of million through product revenues  resulting in remaining in current derivative liabilities at december  revenue from product sales includes cost reimbursements from venture partners for their share of mine costs 
the mining ventures function as captive cost companies  they supply product only to their owners effectively on a cost basis 
accordingly  the minority interests revenue amounts are stated at cost of production and are offset in entirety by an equal amount included in cost of goods sold resulting in no profits or losses reflected in minority interest participants 
as we are responsible for product fulfillment  we have the risks and rewards of a principal in the transaction  and accordingly  we record revenue in this arrangement on a gross basis in accordance with eitf   reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  under the line item freight and other reimbursements 
revenue from product sales also includes reimbursement for freight charges paid on behalf of customers in freight and venture partners cost reimbursements separate from product revenue  in accordance with eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
where we are joint venture participants in the ownership of a north american iron ore mine  our contracts entitle us to receive royalties and management fees  which we earn as the pellets are produced 

table of contents north american coal we recognize revenue when title passes to the customer 
for domestic coal sales  this generally occurs when coal is loaded into rail cars at the mine 
for export coal sales  this generally occurs when coal is loaded into the vessels at the terminal 
asia pacific iron ore sales revenue is recognized at the free on board  or fob  point  which is generally when the product is loaded into the vessel 
foreign currency revenues are converted to australian dollars at the currency exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction 
our asia pacific operations receive funds in united states currency for their iron ore and coal sales 
we use forward exchange contracts  call options  collar options and convertible collar options to hedge our foreign currency exposure for a portion of our sales receipts 
united states currency is converted to australian dollars at the currency exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction 
the primary objective for the use of these instruments is to reduce exposure to changes in australian and united states currency exchange rates and to protect against undue adverse movement in these exchange rates 
effective july   we discontinued hedge accounting for these derivatives  but continue to hold these instruments as economic hedges to manage currency risk 
at december   we had approximately million of outstanding exchange rate contracts in the form of call options  collar options  convertible collar options and forward exchange contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from january to august upon de designation of these cash flow hedges  the instruments are prospectively marked to fair value each reporting period through changes in fair value of derivative instruments  net on the statements of consolidated operations 
in the mark to market adjustments resulted in a net unrealized loss of million  based on a spot rate of at december  the amounts that were previously recorded as a component of other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings and a corresponding realized gain or loss is recognized upon settlement of the related contracts 
since the july  date of de designation  we reclassified a million gain out of accumulated other comprehensive loss related to contracts that settled during the period  which was recorded as product revenues on the statements of consolidated operations for the year ended december  in  and  ineffectiveness resulting in an million loss  a million loss  and a million gain  respectively  was recorded in miscellaneous net on the statements of consolidated operations 
as of december   approximately million of gains remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the effective cash flow hedge contracts prior to de designation 
of this amount  we estimate million will be reclassified to product revenues in the next months upon settlement of the related contracts 
certain supply agreements primarily with our asia pacific customers provide for revenue or refunds based on the ultimate settlement of annual international benchmark pricing provisions 
the pricing provisions are characterized as freestanding derivatives and are required to be accounted for separately once iron ore is shipped 
the derivative instrument  which is settled and billed once the annual international benchmark price is settled  is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period based upon the estimated forward settlement until the benchmark is actually settled 
in the fourth quarter of  we negotiated additional sales with certain of our asia pacific iron ore customers who had previously fulfilled their purchase commitments under current year contracts and required additional tonnage 
in response to the economic downturn and its impact on the global steel industry  we agreed that the provisional pricing for these shipments would be at a discount to benchmark prices to reflect the decline in steel demand and prices  with final pricing being based upon benchmark prices once they are settled 
the discount pricing provisions are characterized as freestanding derivatives and are required to be accounted for separately once the iron ore is shipped 
the derivative instrument  which is settled and billed once the international benchmark price is settled  is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period based upon the estimated forward settlement until the benchmark is actually settled 
we recognized approximately million as product revenues on the statement of consolidated operations for the year ended december   related to the shipment of approximately million tonnes under these pricing provisions 

table of contents as of december   the international benchmark prices have not yet settled 
therefore  the derivative instrument was marked to fair value at december  resulting in a million reduction in product revenues on the statement of consolidated operations in refer to note business summary and significant accounting policies  for further information regarding our revenue recognition policy 
litigation accruals we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as the potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we do not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes contingencies domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves for exposures where a position taken has not met a more likely than not threshold 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
when facts change or the actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve for a matter  we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which the facts changed or the income tax matter is resolved 
prior to  we recorded estimated tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
the effects of applying this interpretation resulted in a decrease of million to retained earnings as of january  fin prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures 
valuation allowance at december   we had a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
in determining the valuation allowance  we assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
mineral reserves we regularly evaluate our economic mineral reserves and update them as required in accordance with sec industry guide the estimated mineral reserves could be affected by future industry conditions  geological conditions and ongoing mine planning 
maintenance of effective production capacity or the mineral reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures 
generally as mining operations progress  haul lengths and lifts increase 
alternatively  changes in economic conditions  or the expected quality of ore reserves could decrease capacity or ore reserves 
technological progress could alleviate such factors  or increase capacity or ore reserves 

table of contents we use our mineral reserve estimates combined with our estimated annual production levels  to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations 
refer to note environmental and mine closure obligations  for further information 
since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation  a significant change in mineral reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation 
we also utilize economic mineral reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets 
decreases in mineral reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items 
asset retirement obligations the accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations 
our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider ie  inflation  overhead and profit  which are escalated at an assumed rate of inflation to the estimated closure dates  and then discounted using the current credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the estimate also incorporates incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and changes in estimates of mine lives 
the closure date for each location is determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves 
the estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates 
changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changes in legal or contractual requirements  available technology  inflation  overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations 
refer to note environmental and mine closure obligations  for further information 
asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 
we monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired 
we determine impairment based on the asset s ability to generate cash flow greater than its carrying value  utilizing an undiscounted probability weighted analysis 
if the analysis indicates the asset is impaired  the carrying value is adjusted to fair value 
fair value can be determined using a market approach  income approach or cost approach 
the impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in substantially different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves  future iron ore prices and production costs 
refer to note business summary and significant accounting policies  for further information regarding our policy on asset impairment 
environmental remediation costs we have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration 
our obligations for known environmental problems at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site 
if the estimate can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts  with no specific amount being more likely  the minimum of the range is accrued 
management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required 
the characteristics of environmental remediation obligations  where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available  and which are subject to changes in regulatory requirements  result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature 
expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements can be reasonably estimated 
potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized 

table of contents employee retirement benefit obligations we  along with our north american iron ore mining ventures  sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all north american employees 
these plans are largely noncontributory  and benefits are generally based on employees years of service and average earnings for a defined period prior to retirement 
we do not provide opeb for most us salaried employees hired after january  pursuant to a asset purchase agreement with the previous owner  pinnoak assumed postretirement benefits for certain employees who will vest more than five years after the asset purchase date of june  postretirement benefits for vested employees and those that will vest within the five year period subsequent to the acquisition date remain obligations of the previous owner 
pinnoak records a provision for estimated postretirement benefits for employees not covered by the asset purchase agreement with the former owner based upon annual valuations 
portman does not have employee retirement benefit obligations 
on september   our board of directors approved modifications to the pension benefits provided to salaried participants 
the modifications retroactively reinstated the final average pay benefit formula previously terminated and replaced with a cash balance formula in july to allow for additional accruals through june  or the continuation of benefits under an improved cash balance formula  whichever is greater 
the change increased the projected benefit obligation  or pbo  by million and pension expense by million in on october   the usw ratified a new four year labor contract  which replaces the labor agreement that expired on september  the new agreement covers approximately  usw represented workers at our empire and tilden mines in michigan  and our united taconite and hibbing mines in minnesota 
the changes enhanced the minimum pension formula by increasing the benefit dollar multipliers and renewed the lump sum special payments for certain employees retiring in the near future 
the changes also included renewal of payments to surviving spouses of certain retirees 
the result of the changes is an increase of million in pbo and million in pension expense 
following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and opeb funding and expense for the years through in millions pension opeb funding expense funding expense estimated assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans primarily retiree healthcare benefits offered by the company are evaluated periodically by management 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the medical care cost trend  and the rate of compensation increase are reviewed annually 
our discount rate of percent remained consistent with we assumed a compensation increase of percent in to determine both our pension and opeb obligations 
this compares with a rate of compensation increase of percent for pension and percent for opeb in additionally  on december   we adopted the irs prescribed mortality tables separate pre retirement and postretirement to determine the expected life of our plan participants  replacing the irs static tables 
following are sensitivities on estimated pension and opeb expense of potential further changes in these key assumptions increase in expense in millions pension opeb decrease discount rate

table of contents changes in actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  employee retirement rates  mortality  compensation levels  plan asset investment performance  and healthcare costs  are determined by the company based on analyses of actual and expected factors 
changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on our financial condition due to the magnitude of our retirement obligations 
refer to note pensions and other postretirement benefits in item for further information 
accounting for business combinations in june  we acquired an additional percent interest in portman through a share repurchase program offered by portman  in which we did not participate 
we subsequently made an off market offer to purchase the outstanding shares and proceeded with a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares to obtain full ownership of portman in the fourth quarter of in addition  effective july   we acquired the remaining percent interest in united taconite 
upon consummation of the purchase  our ownership interest increased from percent to percent 
each of these transactions constituted a step acquisition of a non controlling interest 
in accordance with sfas  business combinations  we accounted for the acquisition of the minority interests by the purchase method 
as a result of each step acquisition  the then historical cost basis of the minority interest balance was reduced to the extent of the percentage interest sold  and the increased ownership obtained was accounted for by increasing the entity s basis from historical cost to fair value for the portion of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the additional ownership acquired 
we are in the process of conducting a valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to each of the acquisitions  most notably  property  plant and equipment  mineral reserves  inventory and sales contracts  and the final allocation will be made when completed 
accordingly  allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to modification in the future 
in estimating the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  we consider information obtained during our due diligence process and utilize various valuation methods  including a market approach  income approach or cost approach 
depending on the approach used  the valuation is performed based upon market prices  where available  the present value of estimated future cash flows  or comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities 
we are required to make subjective estimates in connection with these valuations and allocations
