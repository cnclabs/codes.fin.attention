overview general we provide integrated information management solutions and services for local governments 
we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology it needs of cities  counties  schools and other local government entities 
in addition  we provide professional it services to our customers  including software and hardware installation  data conversion  training and for certain customers  product modifications  along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems 
we also provide subscription based services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting services as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 
our products are generally grouped into four major areas financial management and education  courts and justice  property appraisal and tax  and public records and content management 
we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
these indicators include the following revenues we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses  subscription based services  software services  appraisal services  and maintenance and support 
because the majority of the software we sell is off the shelf  increased sales of software products generally result in incrementally higher gross margins 
thus  the most significant driver to our business is the number and size of software license sales 
in addition  new software license sales generally generate implementation services revenues as well as future maintenance and support revenues  which we view as a recurring revenue source 
we also monitor our customer base and churn since our maintenance and support revenue should increase due to our historically low customer turnover 
cost of revenues and gross margins our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation  subscription based services  maintenance and support  and appraisal services to our customers 
we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base  especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost  such as software licenses  subscription based services  and maintenance and support 
our appraisal projects are seasonal in nature  and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short term basis to coincide with the life of a project 
as of december   our total full time equivalent employee count increased to  from  at december  the majority of these additions were to our implementation and support staff  including additions to our capacity to deliver our backlog 
our implementation 
table of contents and support staff at december  includes full time equivalent employees added as a result of three acquisitions completed in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the primary components of sg a expense are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions  marketing expense  rent and professional fees 
sales commissions generally fluctuate with revenues but other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues 
liquidity and cash flows the primary driver of our cash flows is net income 
uses of cash include acquisitions  capital investments in property and equipment and software development and the discretionary purchases of treasury stock 
in  we purchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million 
almost half of our treasury stock purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of during we also used cash of million to acquire three companies and invested million in property and equipment 
our investment in property and equipment included million for land  office buildings and a related tenant lease 
our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned 
balance sheet cash  accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 
acquisitions we completed the acquisitions of school information systems  inc  versatrans solutions inc and certain assets of olympia computing company  inc d b a schoolmaster to expand our presence in the education market 
the combined purchase price  excluding cash acquired and including transaction costs  was approximately million in cash and approximately  shares of tyler common stock valued at million 
in connection with these transactions we acquired total tangible assets of approximately million and assumed total liabilities of approximately million 
outlook the financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide and has led to continued weakening in the global economic environment during the first quarter of local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate in the first quarter of and for the calendar year 
consistent with our historical trends  we expect that first quarter earnings will not reach the level achieved in the fourth quarter of  however  we currently do not anticipate a material negative impact for the first quarter due to the current economic downturn 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues  cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentage of completion and proportionate performance methods of revenue recognition  the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets  determination of share based compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts using the proportionate performance method of accounting  with considerations for the provisions of emerging issue task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses  subscription 
table of contents based services  appraisal services  maintenance and support  and services that typically range from installation  training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs 
for multiple element software arrangements  which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and non refundable claim 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
because most of our customers are governmental entities  we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments 
in a limited number of cases  we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service  and we may offer a concession to such customer 
in those limited situations where we grant a concession  we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee  but alternatively may perform additional services  such as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software solution 
these amounts have historically been considered nominal 
in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion  our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
also  we review  on at least a quarterly basis  significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision  include  but are not limited to  deterioration of a customer s financial condition  failure to manage our customer s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered  and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 
for those software arrangements that involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  which is considered essential to its functionality  and for substantially all property appraisal outsourcing projects  we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentage of completion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition 
these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections and expected contract costs  as well as measures of progress toward completion 
we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  we perform additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 
we use contract accounting  primarily the percentage of completion method  and apply the provisions of sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software 
in addition  we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects  some of which can range up to three years 
in connection with these and certain other contracts  we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable and or payable pursuant to the contract 
the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 
for subscription based services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting arrangements  we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting  as defined by eitf  using all applicable facts and circumstances  including whether i we sell or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements  ii the element has stand alone value to the customer  iii there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and iv there is a general right of return 
we consider the applicability of eitf no 
 application of sop to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware on a contract by contract basis 
in hosted term based agreements  where the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software  hosting fees are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract commencing when the customer has access to the software 
for professional services associated with hosting arrangements that we determine do not have stand alone value to the customer  we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services 
we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in connection with certain of our contracts  we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date 
many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period 
management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue 
in addition  we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned 
the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in 
table of contents advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period  generally one year 
we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met 
on a periodic basis  we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense  as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value  with the excess allocated to goodwill 
accordingly  we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets  including software  customer related intangibles  trade name and goodwill 
in addition  we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value  generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of april  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  anticipated operating income growth rates  our long term anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate 
the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value 
we have identified two reporting units for impairment testing 
the appraisal services and appraisal software stand alone business unit qualified as a reporting unit since it is one level below an operating segment  discrete financial information exists for the business unit and the executive management group directly reviews this business unit 
the other software business units were aggregated into the other single reporting unit 
the appraisal services and appraisal software stand alone business unit is organized in such a manner that both of its revenue sources are tightly integrated with each other and discrete financial information at the operating profit level does not exist for this business unit s respective revenue sources 
recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used  or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
in addition  products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non competitive 
share based compensation 
we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees  directors and non employee consultants 
we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
share based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
estimated option life is determined using the simplified method in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 

table of contents analysis of results of operations and other the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december   and compared to revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total software licenses subscriptions software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
software license revenues consist of the following components for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total financial management and education courts and justice appraisal and tax and other total software license revenues in we signed material new contracts with average software license fees of approximately  compared to material new contracts signed in with average software license fees of approximately  we consider contracts with a license fee component of  or more to be material 
average software license fees in included the impact of one courts and justice statewide contract that contained an unusually large amount of software license fees 
although a contract is signed in a particular year  the year in which the revenue is recognized may be different because we recognize revenue according to our revenue recognition policy as described in note in the notes to financial statements 
changes in software license revenues consist of the following components software license revenue related to our financial management and education solutions for increased compared to the prior year 
revenue from student information management solutions as well as student transportation management solutions acquired in the last twelve months contributed substantially to the increase 
the remaining increase was mainly due to contract arrangements that included more software license revenue than in the past 
software license revenue related to our courts and justice software solutions increased for compared to the prior year 
new statewide contracts in indiana and new mexico contributed approximately two thirds of the increase 
the remaining increase was primarily due to an expanded presence in the markets for municipal courts software solutions and public safety software solutions 
subscriptions 
subscription based services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from asp arrangements and other hosted service offerings  software subscriptions and disaster recovery services 
asp and other software subscriptions agreements are typically for periods of three to six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement 
disaster recovery 
table of contents and miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically renewable annually 
new asp customers and existing customers converting to asp arrangements provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to new disaster recovery customers and slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services 
software services 
changes in software services revenues consist of the following components software services revenue related to financial management and education solutions  which comprises approximately half of our software services revenue in the years presented  increased substantially compared to this increase was driven in part by increased capacity to deliver backlog following additions to our implementation and support staff since and due to larger and more complex contracts  which include more programming and project management services 
in addition  we acquired a student transportation management solution in january which contributed approximately million to software service revenues in excluding the impact of acquisitions  we have added approximately full time equivalent employees to our financial management and education implementation and training staff since software services revenue related to our courts and justice solutions experienced strong increases compared to  reflecting increased capacity to deliver backlog following additions to our implementation and support staff since mid in addition  increased contract volume for municipal courts software solutions and public safety software solutions also generated higher related services revenue 
we have added approximately full time equivalent employees to our courts and justice implementation and training staff since maintenance 
we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software 
maintenance revenues increased in compared to maintenance and support services grew in  excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in the prior twelve months 
this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 
appraisal services 
appraisal services revenue declined in compared to the appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states 
in late  we substantially completed several projects related to the ohio revaluation cycle  which occurs every six years  as well as a few other large contracts 
appraisal revenues for the first six months of were down compared to the first six months of in mid we began a complete reappraisal of real property in orleans parish  louisiana 
this contract is valued at approximately million and consists of two separate phases expected to be complete by late as a result of this contract and an overall increase in contract volume  appraisal revenues for the last six months of increased over the last six months of in  we expect appraisal revenue to increase over by a modest amount 

table of contents cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december of of related related change in thousands revenues revenues software licenses acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december gross margin percentages change software licenses and acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other overall gross margin software license 
approximately one half of our cost of software license revenues is amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products  with third party software costs making up the balance 
once a product is released  we begin to amortize  over the estimated useful life of the product  any capitalized costs associated with its development 
amortization expense is determined on a product by product basis at an annual rate not less than straight line basis over the product s estimated life  which is generally five years 
development costs consist mainly of personnel costs  such as salary and benefits paid to our developers  and rent for related office space 
in  our software license gross margin percentage rose compared to the prior year mainly due to strong license fee revenue increases 
because approximately one half of our cost of software license revenues is comprised of amortization of capitalized development costs  increased license fee revenues inherently result in higher gross margins 
software services  maintenance and subscription based services 
cost of software services  maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software  conversion of customer data  training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery 
in  the software services  maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 
we have increased our implementation and support staff by full time equivalent employees since in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog 
this increase includes full time equivalent employees related to acquisitions completed since appraisal services 
a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable  as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects completion 
our appraisal gross margin for is higher than the prior year due to cost savings associated with a significant complex reappraisal project 

table of contents our blended gross margin in was higher than the prior year in large part due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale  with resulting increases in gross margin for each revenue category 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the following years ended december of of change in thousands revenues revenues selling  general and administrative expenses excluding the impact of acquisitions  our full time equivalent sg a employee count increased from research and development expense the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december of of change in thousands revenues revenues research and development expense research and development expense mainly consist of costs associated with the microsoft dynamics ax project  in addition to costs associated with other new product development efforts 
in january  we entered into a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide 
research and development costs increased over the prior year because the microsoft dynamics ax development effort was not fully staffed until mid in and  we offset our research and development expense by million and million  respectively  which were the amounts earned under the terms of our research and development agreement with microsoft 
we amended this agreement in september to define the scope of reimbursable development through the balance of the project and now expect to offset research and development expense by approximately  each quarter through the end of the actual amount and timing of future research and development costs and related reimbursements and whether they are capitalized or expensed may vary 
non cash legal settlement related to warrants on june   we settled outstanding litigation related to the warrants owned by bana 
as disclosed in prior sec filings  the warrants entitled bana to acquire million shares of tyler common stock at an exercise price of per share 
following court ordered mediation  in july  bana paid us million and we issued to bana  restricted shares of tyler common stock 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of million  which is not tax deductible 

table of contents amortization of customer and trade name intangibles acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles 
the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization 
amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues  while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as a non operating expense 
the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are to years 
the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december change in thousands amortization of customer and trade name intangibles in  we completed three acquisitions  which increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by million 
this amount will be amortized over approximately years 
estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles  excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues  for the next five years is as follows in thousands other interest income was the main component of other income in both and other income in also includes non usage and other fees associated with a credit agreement entered into in october interest income in was million compared to million in interest income declined due to lower invested cash balances and slightly lower interest rates 
our invested cash balances declined due to increased purchases of treasury stock and investments in office buildings and land in income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december change in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate increased approximately twelve points compared to the prior year due to a non cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of million  which was not deductible 
the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of primarily due to non cash legal settlement related to warrants charge which was not deductible  as well as state income taxes  non deductible share based compensation expense  the qualified manufacturing activities deduction  and non deductible meals and entertainment costs 
slightly less than half of our stock option awards qualify as an incentive stock option iso for income tax purposes 
as such  a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition 
non qualified stock options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset  which is a temporary difference  until the time that the option is exercised 
due to the treatment of isos for tax purposes  our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 

table of contents compared to revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total software licenses subscriptions software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
software license revenues consist of the following components for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total financial management and education courts and justice appraisal and tax and other total software license revenues changes in software license revenues consist of the following components software license revenue related to our financial management and education solutions for decreased compared to the prior year 
over half the decline was due to product mix in that required less third party software 
a portion of the remaining decline was mainly due to a number of customers in choosing our subscription based options  rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement 
although these customers represented a relatively small percentage of new customers  the size of those contracts was larger than in the prior year 
subscription based arrangements result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional perpetual software license arrangement but generate higher overall subscription based services revenue over the term of the contract 
software license revenue related to our courts and justice software solutions increased for compared to the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded software license revenue of approximately million from a contract which had been deferred in accordance with the terms of the contract 
appraisal and tax and other software license declined in compared to the prior year primarily due to the deferral of software license revenue on a customer arrangement pending establishment of a revised timeline for the completion of certain development and implementation services 
subscriptions 
in  new asp customers provided approximately two thirds of the subscription revenue increase due to further expansion into existing markets and new markets such as pennsylvania and texas 

table of contents software services 
changes in software services revenues consist of the following components software services revenue related to financial management and education solutions  which comprises approximately half of our software services revenue in the years presented  experienced modest increases in compared to the prior year due to increased contract volume and additions to implementation and training staff which enabled us to deliver our backlog at a faster rate 
excluding the impact of acquisitions we added approximately people to our financial management and education implementation and training staff during software services revenue related to our courts and justice solutions experienced substantial increases in compared to the prior year  reflecting increased contract volume 
we had approximately active odyssey contracts in compared to approximately active odyssey contracts in  primarily due to continued expansion in texas and florida and a new contract with indiana 
we added approximately people to our courts and justice implementation and training staff during software services revenue related to appraisal and tax and other solutions  which comprise approximately of our software services revenue in the periods presented  had moderate increases for compared to the majority of the increase is related to one large appraisal and tax software implementation  which was substantially completed by december  maintenance 
maintenance revenues increased over the prior year due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our solutions 
appraisal services 
appraisal services revenue for was higher than the increase was due to activity related to ohio s revaluation cycle  which occurs every six years  and a million contract with fulton county  georgia  which began late in the ohio revaluation projects began with smaller counties late in the first quarter of and expanded to larger counties by the third quarter of a substantial portion of the ohio revaluation projects was complete by december  
table of contents cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december of of related related change in thousands revenues revenues software licenses acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december gross margin percentages change software licenses and acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other overall gross margin software license 
in  our software license gross margin percentage increased slightly compared to the prior year because our product mix in included less third party software  which has higher associated costs than proprietary software 
the gross margin also benefited from lower amortization expense of software development costs because some products became fully amortized during the first quarter of software services  maintenance and subscription based services 
in  the software services  maintenance and subscription gross margin percentage increased over the prior year because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 
we increased our implementation and support staff by full time equivalent employees since december  this increase includes additional employees related to acquisitions completed in the remaining additions were to increase our capacity to train and deliver our contract backlog  particularly for our courts and justice solutions 
appraisal services 
in  higher revenues associated with increased activity on the ohio revaluation projects contributed to the slight appraisal services gross margin percentage increase 
our blended gross margin for was flat compared to the prior year due to a revenue mix that included less software license and significant additions to our development and implementation staff to deliver our growing backlog 
software license revenue inherently has higher gross margins than other revenues such as professional services and hardware 
although the revenue mix for also included less software license than the prior year  the negative impact on the gross margin was offset by lower third party software costs as well as lower amortization expense of software development costs described above 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the following years ended december of of change in thousands revenues revenues selling  general and administrative expenses sg a costs grew at a slower rate than revenues in due to leverage in the utilization of our administrative and sales staff

in  we reduced our research and development expense by million  which was the amount earned under the terms of our strategic alliance with microsoft 
other in interest income was the main component of other income 
other income in also includes non usage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in january and gains and losses on risk management liabilities and assets associated with a foreign exchange contract 
interest income in was million compared to million in the increase in interest income was due to higher invested cash balances as the result of positive cash flow in income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december change in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of primarily due to state income taxes  non deductible share based compensation expense  the qualified manufacturing activities deduction  and non deductible meals and entertainment costs 
the effective rate for was lower than the effective tax rate mainly due to changes in the texas franchise tax law and rates enacted in the second quarter of and favorable state income tax audit results 
financial condition and liquidity as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents of million and current and non current investments of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million at december  as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit totaling million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts 

table of contents the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december in thousands cash flows provided by used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures 
other capital resources include cash on hand  public and private issuances of debt and equity securities  and bank borrowings 
the capital and credit markets have become more volatile and tight as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies 
it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors 
notwithstanding the foregoing  at this time  we believe that cash provided by operating activities  cash on hand and our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  income tax obligations  and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
in  operating activities provided net cash of million  primarily generated from net income of million  non cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of million  non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million  non cash share based compensation expense of million  and a decrease in net operating assets of million 
net operating assets declined mainly due to several advance payments from customers offset somewhat by an increase in annual maintenance billings processed in december 
our short term and non current investments available for sale consist of auction rate municipal securities ars which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgage backed securities 
short term investments available for sale consist of ars which were sold at par during the period january  through february  all of our non current ars are reflected at estimated fair value in the balance sheet at december  in prior periods  due to the auction process which took place every to days for most ars  quoted market prices were readily available  which would have qualified as level under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements 
however  due to recent events in credit markets beginning during the first quarter of  the auction events for most of these securities failed 
therefore  quoted prices in active markets are no longer available and we determined the estimated fair values of these securities as of december   utilizing a discounted trinomial model 
in association with this estimate of fair value  we have recorded an after tax temporary unrealized loss on our non current ars of  net of related tax effects of  in  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 
as of december   we have continued to earn and collect interest on all of our ars 
we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues  because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgage backed securities  have redemption features which call for redemption at of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aaa 
the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds payment of principal and accrued interest  if it becomes necessary 
in addition  we do not plan to sell any of the ars prior to maturity at an amount below the original purchase value and  at this time  do not deem it probable that we will receive less than of the principal and accrued interest 
based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of million  expected operating cash flows and the liquidation of  of ars subsequent to the period ending december   we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business  and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period 
we have classified these securities as non current because we believe the market for these securities may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover 
we will continue to evaluate any changes in the market value of our non current ars and in the future  depending upon existing market conditions  we may be required to record an other than temporary decline in market value
