we provide solutions to our customers by utilizing a combination of products and services  including consulting  application software  mobile managed services  mobile workstations and devices  and wireless infrastructure 
our solutions are designed to allow the real time usage of data throughout a customer s enterprise in order to enhance workflow  improve customer service  increase revenue and reduce costs 
we sell wireless communication and computing devices  including mobile workstations that connect to a customer s wireless network so that information can be accessed from any location within the enterprise 
we also implement customized software applications and provide rfid technology  a data exchange method using transponders that store and remotely send or retrieve information  to enable the transmission and processing of that information between the customer s information system and its wireless communication and computing devices 
we also offer professional services that support and complement a customer s wireless computing systems and enterprise wide electronic software systems  including consulting  mobile managed services  training  engineering  technical support  and network monitoring 
historically  the sale of mobile workstations and other wireless devices has represented a majority of our net revenues 
in the past two years  we have been transitioning our business to provide more software applications and consulting and professional services 
with our new focus on selling software and services  we believe that we can offer more comprehensive enterprise mobility solutions that provide greater value to our customers and generate higher and more recurring revenue for our business 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our wholly owned subsidiary  infologix systems corporation 
we own certain patents and patent applications through our wholly owned subsidiaries opt acquisition llc  embedded technologies  llc and infologix ddms  inc we consolidate opt acquisition llc  embedded technologies  llc  infologix ddms  inc and infologix systems corporation for financial reporting purposes 
we serve the healthcare and commercial industries  which are experiencing significant challenges  primarily due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions that have resulted in a decreased demand for their products and services 
as a result of this macroeconomic downturn  some of our customers may face financial challenges in some of our customers are facing constraints on their information technology budgets and are seeking more flexibility in the type of mobility solutions they implement and the timing of their purchases from us 
it is unclear when the general economic climate will improve and when our customers may benefit from improved conditions 
going concern the current deteriorating macroeconomic conditions have had a major impact on the industries we serve 
during the second half of  we experienced reduced sales and compressed margins  particularly in the infrastructure and hardware areas of our business 
we have responded to the challenging times by undertaking a series of cost reduction initiatives  including the elimination of executive bonuses  reduction of employee salaries and reduction in the number of employees 
economic conditions have not improved in and we expect to be an extremely challenging year 
our financial statements for the year ended december  have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates continuing operations  securing additional debt or equity financing  selling certain assets  and realizing assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
however  we have incurred significant net losses from through  including a net loss of  for the year 
table of contents ended december   in connection with our transition from being primarily a seller of workstations and devices to becoming a provider of comprehensive enterprise mobility solutions and the write off of certain non realizable assets  and we have an accumulated deficit of  as of december  during this three year transition period  we have hired experienced management and staff to execute our business plans and made strategic acquisitions  and we have also managed our liquidity by incurring million of senior debt at high interest rates and other associated costs 
as a result of our capital and debt structure and recurring losses  we have substantial liquidity requirements related to the repayment of our revolving line of credit that comes due on november  and to earn out payments for past acquisitions 
we do not currently expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund those obligations 
as a result  our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph which raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we have undertaken a series of actions to reduce costs and are pursuing various initiatives to continue as a going concern and provide for our future success 
our plan to improve our liquidity contemplates securing additional debt or equity financing  selling certain assets of the business  restructuring our debt and further evaluating our staffing model 
we have been in discussions with several strategic and institutional investors and lenders regarding securing additional financing 
our ability to implement these plans successfully is dependent on many circumstances outside of our direct control  including general economic conditions and the financial strength of our customers 
any additional financing we are able to secure will likely be subject to a number of conditions and involve additional costs 
given the current negative conditions in the economy generally and the credit markets in particular  there is uncertainty as to whether we will be able to generate sufficient liquidity to repay our outstanding debt  to make our earn out payments and to meet working capital needs 
if we are unable to improve our liquidity position  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
acquisitions we are transitioning our business model from being principally a reseller of third party and proprietary hardware to being a fully integrated software and service solutions business 
acquiring businesses that allow us to improve and expand our software  consulting and other professional services offerings has been central to our strategic plan 
we expect that these acquisitions will accelerate our growth  increase our overall gross margins  and help complete our transition to becoming a mobile solutions provider

characteristics of our net revenues and expenses we generate our net revenues through the resale of wireless and mobile hardware and systems  including mobile workstations  computers  peripherals  and related products under which the revenue is recognized 
sales revenue on product is recognized when both the title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  generally upon shipment 
we also generate revenues from consulting and professional services on either a fixed fee or time and expense basis 
net revenues from our consulting and professional services are recognized on a time and expense basis at the time the service is delivered and the expenses are incurred 
net revenues from the sale of our proprietary learning technologies and any professional consulting or engineering services provided on a fixed fee basis are recognized according to a proportionate method of accounting and is recognized ratably over the contract period based upon actual project hours as compared to budgeted project hours 
we also generate net revenues from the sale of extended warranties on wireless and mobile hardware and systems  including mobile workstations  computers  peripherals  and related products 
we record revenues derived from our third party extended warranty programs on a gross basis and also record the related costs as cost of revenues 
payments received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
certain contract payment terms may result in customer billing occurring at a pace slower than revenue recognition 

table of contents the resulting revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed and project cost is included in unbilled revenue on our consolidated balance sheet 
cost of revenues consists of all expenses that are directly attributable to the costs associated with the purchase  for resale  of wireless and mobile hardware and systems  including computers  peripherals  and related products 
fluctuations in our gross margin may occur due to changes in our ability to obtain discounts on product sales or our ability to negotiate higher margins on sales contracts with large customers 
cost of sales also consists of the direct costs associated with those employees or sub contractors that perform our professional consulting services on behalf of our customers 
selling expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  travel and other costs of our regional and national account sales representatives  sales management and business development expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of the costs attributable to the support of our operations  such as costs related to information systems  salaries  expenses and office space costs for executive management  inside sales and customer support  warehousing  technical support  financial accounting  purchasing  administrative and human resources personnel  insurance  recruiting fees  legal  accounting and other professional services 
critical accounting estimates and policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing the financial statements  management has utilized available information  including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation 
accounts receivable we grant credit  generally without collateral  to our customers  which are primarily in the healthcare and commercial markets 
consequently  we are subject to potential customer credit risk related to changes in economic conditions within those markets 
however  we believe that our billing and collection policies are adequate to minimize the potential credit risk 
we have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt including historical experience and current economic and market conditions 
account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 

table of contents inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary for estimated obsolete and slow moving goods 
we mark down inventory in an amount equal to the difference between cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demands  selling prices and market conditions 
the creation of such provision results in a write down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to cost of revenues 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an asset s value is impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
when estimating future cash flows  we consider factors such as expected future operating income and historical trends  as well as the effects of demand and competition 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the estimated fair value of the asset 
such estimates require the use of judgment and numerous subjective assumptions  which  if actual experience varies  could result in material differences in the requirements for impairment charges 
intangible assets we account for intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the costs of successful registrations for patents are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which is generally sixteen years  using the straight line method 
the costs of unsuccessful registrations are charged to expense 
acquired technology is recorded at its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which averages four years  using the straight line method 
developed technology is also amortized using the straight line method  generally over five years 
license fees are amortized over the license period using the straight line method 
customer lists are amortized over a period of six to ten years 
software capitalization we capitalize the cost of internal use software in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop provides guidance for the accounting for computer software developed or acquired for internal use  including the requirement to capitalize certain costs and the amortization of these costs 
costs for preliminary stage projects are expensed as incurred while application stage projects are capitalized 
we cease capitalizing costs and commence amortization of the software on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life  typically three to five years  when it is ready for its intended use 
we capitalize certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software to be sold or licensed to our customers 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the costs of compute software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we expense  as incurred  those costs incurred prior to achieving technological feasibility and capitalize those arising after technological feasibility has been achieved 
we amortize the capitalized costs using the straight line method over the developed product s estimated economic life 
we cease capitalizing costs when the software is ready for general release 
potential impairment is determined by comparing the balance of unamortized capitalized software costs to the net revenues projected for a capitalized software project 
if efforts to sell that software project are terminated  or if the projected net revenues from that software project drops below a level that is less than the unamortized balance  then an impairment charge would be recognized 

table of contents revenue recognition net revenues are generated through product sales  warranty and maintenance agreements  professional consulting  programming and engineering services  long term support services  and educational learning programs 
net revenues from product sales are recognized when both the title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  generally upon shipment 
we generate net revenues from the sale of extended warranties on wireless and mobile hardware and systems  including mobile workstations  computers  peripherals  and related products 
revenue from the sale of component warranties is recognized upon execution of the warranty agreement 
we do not bear associated warranty risk because it has contracted with a third party to fully assume all risks and obligations 
we also generate revenue from consulting and other professional services on either a fee for service or fixed fee basis 
revenue from consulting and other professional services that is contracted as fee for service is recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
direct costs for travel and accommodations are reimbursable in accordance with the contract terms and are recognized as net revenue in the period the related expense is incurred 
revenue from the sale of proprietary learning technologies and those consulting and other professional services provided on a fixed fee basis is recognized according to a proportionate method of revenue recognition and is recognized ratably over the contract period based upon actual project hours completed compared to total budgeted project hours 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
our evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets considers both positive and negative evidence 
the weight given to the potential effects of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
stock based compensation we account for share based payments in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments at fair value 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 we record share based compensation within general and administrative expenses to correspond with the same line item as the cash compensation paid to employees 
non employee stock based compensation the cost of stock based compensation awards issued to non employees for services are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services  whichever is more readily determinable  using the measurement date guidelines enumerated in emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services

our nols include losses of generated by new age translation  inc  the predecessor to infologix  inc  which are subject to restrictions under internal revenue code section  due to the change in ownership in that entity

as more fully discussed below  we are currently in violation of certain of our financial covenants with respect to our loan and security agreement with hercules 
as a result of these covenant violations and because our total leverage ratio exceeds to  we currently are not permitted to borrow additional funds under our revolver facility or to make earn out payments under our agreements with delta and hia

as of december   we were not in compliance with the minimum adjusted ebitda required under our loan and security agreement and we were not in compliance with the minimum consolidated ebitda for the three month periods ended january  and february  as a result of the covenant violation  we currently are not permitted to borrow additional funds under our revolving facility 
also as a result of the covenant violation and because our total leverage ratio exceeds to  we are prohibited from satisfying our earn out obligations related to our acquisition of the assets of hia 
due to our inability to comply with these covenants  we are in discussions with hercules to amend our loan and security agreement to restructure its terms  including to including to waive past violations and to revise the 
table of contents financial covenants and the amortization related to the term loan portion of the facility 
while we remain in discussions with hercules regarding an amendment  we have not obtained  and there can be no assurance that we will obtain  any such amendment 
we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs in connection with our negotiations of an amendment 
further  on march   hercules sent us a letter serving as a notice of events of default and reservation of rights the first notice letter

hercules further asserted that we failed to promptly notify it of the alleged event of default because we did not inform hercules of the overadvance until march  hercules elected to charge us increased interest and a late fee of approximately for the period of the overadvance 
furthermore  hercules asserted additional events of default for our failure to deliver certain unaudited monthly financial statements and securities account control agreements

based on satisfaction of certain milestones described in the earn out agreement  we recorded an adjustment of  to the purchase price as an increase to goodwill  which reflects the amount that hia earned under the earn out for the first year following closing and is also the maximum amount hia could have earned 
due to the restrictions in our loan and security agreement and due to our lack of available cash flow  we are prohibited from making the earn out payment to hia that would otherwise be currently due and payable 
we are currently in discussions with hia regarding this payment
