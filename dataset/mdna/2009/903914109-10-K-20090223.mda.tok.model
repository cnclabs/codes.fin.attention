item properties 
location and characteristics the company owns oil and natural gas leases in wyoming and pennsylvania 
the leases in wyoming are primarily federal leases with year lease terms until establishment of production 
production on a lease extends the lease terms until cessation of that production 
the company owns leases totaling approximately  gross  net acres currently held by production hbp in wyoming 
the hbp acreage includes all of the company s leases held within the productive area of the pinedale and jonah fields 
the leases in pennsylvania include both those from private individuals  typically with lease terms of five years until establishment of production and leases from the commonwealth of pennsylvania  which have lease term of five years until establishment of production 
production on the pennsylvania leases extends the lease terms until cessation of that production 
the company owns approximately gross net acres currently held by production or operations in pennsylvania 
green river basin  wyoming as of december   the company owned developed oil and natural gas leases totaling  gross  net acres in the green river basin of sublette county  wyoming which represents of the company s total developed net acreage 
the company owns undeveloped oil and natural gas leases totaling  gross  net acres in the green river basin of sublette county  wyoming which represents of the company s total undeveloped net acreage 
the company s acreage in the green river basin primarily covers the pinedale field 
table of contents with several other undeveloped acreage blocks north and west of the pinedale field as well as acreage in the jonah field 
holding costs of leases in wyoming not held by production were approximately million for the year ended december  the primary target on the company s wyoming acreage is the tight gas sands of the upper cretaceous lance pool formation 
exploratory wells 
during  the company participated in the drilling of a total of gross net productive exploratory wells on the green river basin properties 
at december   there were gross net additional exploratory wells that commenced during the year that were either still drilling or had operations suspended at a depth short of total depth and thus a determination of productive capability could not be made at year end 
development wells 
during  the company participated in the drilling of gross net productive development wells on the green river basin properties 
at year end  there were gross net additional development wells that commenced during and were either still drilling or had operations suspended at a depth short of total depth 
for purposes of this report  development wells are wells identified as proven undeveloped locations by the company s independent petroleum engineering firm  netherland  sewell associates  inc  at the previous year end reserve evaluation 
when drilled  these locations will be counted as development wells 
pennsylvania as of december   the company owned developed oil and gas leases totaling gross net acres in the pennsylvania portion of the appalachian basin which represents of the company s total developed net acreage 
the company owns undeveloped oil and gas leases totaling  gross  net acres in this area which represents of the company s total undeveloped net acreage 
holding costs of leases in pennsylvania not held by production were approximately million for the year ended december  exploratory wells 
during the year ended december   the company participated in the drilling of a total of gross net wells on the pennsylvania properties 
during  the company began acquisition of a d seismic survey covering the marshlands prospect area 
at year end  acquisition was still underway 
processing of this data set is expected in early with potential inclusion of exploratory well locations in the drilling program

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the financial condition and operating results of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the company 
except as otherwise indicated  all amounts are expressed in us dollars 
we have one operating segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development with one geographical segment  the united states 
the company currently generates the majority of its revenue  earnings and cash flow from the production and sales of natural gas and oil from its property in southwest wyoming 
the price of natural gas in the southwest wyoming region is a critical factor to the company s business 
the price of natural gas in southwest wyoming historically has been volatile 
the average annual realizations for the period have ranged from to per mcf 
this volatility could be detrimental to the company s financial performance 
the company seeks to limit the impact of this volatility on its results by entering into forward sales and derivative contracts for natural gas 
the average realization for the company s natural gas during was per mcf  including realized gains on commodity derivatives 
for the quarter ended december   the average realization for the company s natural gas was per mcf  including realized gains on commodity derivatives 
the company s average price realization for natural gas  excluding realized gains on commodity derivatives  was per mcf and per mcf for the year and quarter ended december   respectively 
the company has grown its natural gas and oil production significantly over the past five years and management believes it has the ability to continue growing production by drilling already identified locations on its leases in wyoming 
the company delivered production growth on an mcfe basis during the quarter ended december  as compared to the same quarter in and production growth from continuing operations for the year ended december  compared to the same period in management expects to deliver additional production growth during by drilling and bringing into production additional wells in wyoming 
production bcfe the company currently conducts operations exclusively in the united states 
substantially all of the oil and natural gas activities are conducted jointly with others and  accordingly  amounts presented reflect only the company s proportionate interest in such activities 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
in  we saw significant changes in the business environment in which we operate  including severe economic uncertainty  increasing market volatility and continued tightening of credit markets 
the market conditions in contributed to record high commodity prices during most of the year and nearly unprecedented drops in these commodity prices in the second half of the year 
against this backdrop  we believe that our results of operations show just how successful we have been in improving our business 
the highlights in include record operational and financial results 
in  the company established new production records along with new records in earnings and cash flow while maintaining a low cost structure which contributes to the consistency of the company s growth and returns 
outlook in  we experienced challenges associated with changing market conditions  which caused significant volatility in commodity prices and the tightening of the economy 
however  we believe we are well positioned to weather the current economic downturn because of our status as a low cost operator in the industry and our financial flexibility 
although we expect that our net cash provided by operating activities may be negatively affected by general economic conditions  we believe that we will continue to generate strong cash flow from operations  which  along with our available cash  will provide sufficient liquidity to allow us to return value to our shareholders 
while it is possible that we may not have access to the credit markets on acceptable terms  we expect to rely on our available 
table of contents cash  our existing credit facility and the cash we generate from our operations to meet our obligations and fund our capital expenditures and operations over the next twelve months 
a continued  long term disruption in the credit markets could make financing more expensive or unavailable  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  application of gaap requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
set forth below is a discussion of the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which we believe involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
these policies relate to estimates of volumes of oil and natural gas reserves used in calculating depletion  the amount of standardized measure used in computing the ceiling test limitations and the amount of abandonment obligations used in such calculations 
assumptions  judgments and estimates are also required in determining impairments of undeveloped properties and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
oil and gas reserves 
the term proved reserves is defined by the sec in rule a of regulation s x under the securities act of in general  proved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie prices and costs at the date of the estimate 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided by contractual arrangements  but not escalated based on future economic conditions 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the company s dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves may result from lower prices  evaluation of additional operating history  mechanical problems on our wells and catastrophic events such as explosions  hurricanes and floods 
lower prices also make it uneconomical to drill wells or produce from fields with high operating costs 
our proved reserves are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate materially from actual results 
as a result  our estimates of proved reserves could vary over time  and could vary from actual results 
full cost method of accounting 
the accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires that we choose between gaap alternatives 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas operations 
under this method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which the company incurs costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and natural gas properties for each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method 
changes in estimates of proved reserves  future development costs or asset retirement obligations are accounted for prospectively in our depletion calculation 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 

table of contents companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter on a country by country basis utilizing prices in effect on the last day of the quarter 
sec regulation s x rule states that if prices in effect at the end of a quarter are the result of a temporary decline and prices improve prior to the issuance of the financial statements  the increased price may be applied in the computation of the ceiling test 
the ceiling limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the after tax  present value  discounted at  of future net revenues attributable to proved reserves  known as the standardized measure  plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  the company will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower dd a expense in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the company did not have any write downs related to the full cost ceiling limitation in   or as of december   the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of the company s oil and natural gas properties 
estimates of standardized measure at december  were based on realized natural gas prices which averaged per mcf and on realized liquids prices which averaged per barrel in the us a reduction in oil and natural gas prices and or estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves would reduce the ceiling limitation and could result in a ceiling test write down 
asset retirement obligation 
the company s asset retirement obligations aro consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and natural gas properties 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and natural gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an aro  estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted  risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  the company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a 
entitlements method of accounting for oil and natural gas sales 
the company generally sells natural gas  condensate and crude oil under both long term and short term agreements at prevailing market prices and under multi year contracts that provide for a fixed price of oil and natural gas 
the company recognizes revenues when the oil and natural gas is delivered  which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership  prices are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company accounts for oil and natural gas sales using the entitlements method 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon the company s ownership share of volumes sold  regardless of whether it has taken its ownership share of such volumes 
the company records a receivable or a liability to the extent it receives less or more than its share of the volumes and related revenue 
make up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally governed by agreements between the company and its partners with respect to specific properties or  in the absence of such agreements  through negotiation 
the value of volumes over or under produced can change based on changes in commodity prices 
the company prefers the entitlements method of accounting for oil and natural gas sales because it allows for recognition of revenue based on its actual share of jointly owned production  results in better matching of revenue with related operating expenses  and provides balance sheet recognition of the estimated value of product imbalances 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis temporary differences 

table of contents to assess the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
as of december   the company had net deferred tax assets totaling million which management considers is more likely than not to be realized 
forward natural gas sales transactions the company primarily relies on fixed price physical delivery contracts  which are considered sales in the normal course of business  to manage its commodity price exposure 
the company  from time to time  also uses derivative instruments as a way to manage its exposure to commodity prices 
see note 
fair value measurements 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of january  the implementation of sfas no 
was applied prospectively for our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  primarily our commodity derivatives  with no material impact on consolidated results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
see note for additional information 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at measurement date and establishes a three level hierarchy for measuring fair value 
the valuation assumptions utilized to measure the fair value of the company s commodity derivatives were observable inputs based on market data obtained from independent sources and are considered level inputs quoted prices for similar assets  liabilities adjusted and market corroborated inputs 
in consideration of counterparty credit risk  the company assessed the possibility of whether each counterparty to the derivative would default by failing to make any contractually required payments as scheduled in the derivative instrument in determining the fair value 
additionally  the company considers that it is of substantial credit quality and has the financial resources and willingness to meet its potential repayment obligations associated with the derivative transactions 
the fair values summarized below were determined in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
in addition  we aligned the categories below with the level   and fair value measurements as defined by sfas no 
the balance of net unrealized gains and losses recognized for our energy related derivative instruments at december  is summarized in the following table based on the inputs used to determine fair value level a level b level c total assets current derivatives liabilities current derivatives a values represent observable unadjusted quoted prices for traded instruments in active markets 
b values with inputs that are observable directly or indirectly for the instrument  but do not qualify for level c values with a significant amount of inputs that are not observable for the instrument 
legal  environmental and other contingencies 
a provision for legal  environmental and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determines when the company should record losses for these items based on information available to the company 
share based payment arrangements 
the company follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r which requires the measurement and 
table of contents recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values

see note for additional information 
financial statement restatement 
on october   in connection with the preparation of our quarterly report for the third quarter  management determined that the contemporaneous formal documentation we had prepared in the first quarter of to support our initial natural gas hedge designations for production sold on rex did not meet the technical requirements to qualify for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

in order to cause the hedge contracts to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 the company was required to predict and document the future relationship between prices at rex sales points and the sales prices at the northwest pipeline rockies the basis of the contracts at the time the derivative contracts were entered into 
the actual relationship between the sales prices at the two locations was different than that predicted by the company  which affected our ability to effectively demonstrate ongoing effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the forecasted transaction as outlined in our contemporaneous documentation as set forth under the requirements of sfas no 
the company restated the consolidated financial statements for the periods ended march  and june  to reflect the inability to qualify for hedge accounting treatment on the rex designated derivative contracts 
the effect of the restatement was to recognize a non cash  after tax  mark to market unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of million in the first quarter of and a non cash  after tax  mark to market unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of million in the second quarter of there is no effect in any period on overall cash flows  total assets  total liabilities or total stockholders equity 
because these contracts were entered into and expire in fiscal year  there is no change in full year net income or operating cash flows as a result of the accounting treatment of the derivative contracts  as restated 
the restatement did not have any impact on any of the financial covenants under the company s senior credit facility or senior notes due and recently issued accounting pronouncements

on a unit of production basis  loe costs increased to per mcfe during the year ended december  as compared to per mcfe during the same period in mainly due to costs related to non operated properties for water disposal costs 
during the year ended december  production taxes were million compared to million during the same period in  or per mcfe during the year ended december  as compared to per mcfe during the same period in the increase in per unit taxes is largely attributable to increased sales revenues as a result of increased production and higher realized gas prices received during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in production taxes are calculated based on a percentage of revenue from production 
therefore  higher prices received increased production taxes on a per unit basis 
gathering fees increased to million during compared to million during largely due to increased production volumes

these amounts 
table of contents relate to derivative contracts that the company entered into during the first quarter of in order to mitigate commodity price exposure on a portion of the forecasted production which was expected to be sold on rex 
due to limited historical data correlating rex sales points and nwpl rockies the basis of the contracts  the company was unable to effectively demonstrate correlation between the derivative instrument and the forecasted transaction according to the contemporaneous documentation as set forth under the requirements of sfas no 
causing the derivative contracts to no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
the realized gain on commodity derivatives relates to actual amounts received under these derivative contracts while the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives represents the change in the fair value of these derivative instruments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is currently driven primarily by the prevailing price for the company s wyoming natural gas production 
historically  prices received for natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  ranging from per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during pricing volatility is expected to continue 
realized natural gas prices are derived from the financial statements which include the effects of realized hedging gains and losses and natural gas balancing 
the company primarily relies on fixed price forward natural gas sales to manage its commodity price exposure 
these fixed price forward natural gas sales are considered normal sales 
the company  from time to time  also uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to commodity prices 
the company has periodically entered into fixed price to index price swap agreements in order to hedge a portion of its natural gas production 
the natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivative contracts are typically referenced to natural gas index prices as reported by such publications as inside ferc gas market report 
based on management s current estimates  future production is expected to be sufficient to meet delivery requirements associated with the company s derivative contracts and fixed price forward physical delivery contracts 
under sfas no 
 all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheets  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statements of operations 
on october   in connection with the preparation of our quarterly report for the third quarter  management of company and the audit committee of the board of directors determined that the contemporaneous formal documentation we had prepared in the first quarter of to support our initial natural gas hedge designations for production sold on rex did not meet the technical requirements to qualify for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas no 
in order to cause the hedge contracts to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 the company was required to predict and document the future relationship between prices at rex sales points and the sales prices at the northwest pipeline rockies the basis of the contracts at the time the hedge contracts were entered into 
the actual relationship between the sales prices at the two locations was different than that predicted by the company  which affected our ability to effectively demonstrate ongoing effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the forecasted transaction as outlined in our contemporaneous documentation as set forth under the requirements of sfas no 
while such derivatives no longer qualify for 
table of contents hedge accounting treatment  the company believes that these contracts remain a valuable component of our commodity price risk management program 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for natural gas commodity derivatives to reflect unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivative contracts in the income statement rather than on the balance sheet 
the company has historically followed hedge accounting for its natural gas hedges 
under this accounting method  the unrealized gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges calculated on a mark to market basis  net of tax was recorded on the balance sheet in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
when an unrealized hedging gain or loss was realized upon contract expiration  it was reclassified into earnings through inclusion in natural gas sales revenues 
the company continues to record the fair value of its commodity derivatives as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets  but records the changes in the fair value of its commodity derivatives in the consolidated statements of income as gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
there is no resulting effect on overall cash flow  total assets  total liabilities or total stockholders equity  and there is no impact on any of the financial covenants under the company s senior credit facility or senior notes due and the company also utilizes fixed price forward physical delivery contracts at southwest wyoming delivery points to mitigate its commodity price exposure
