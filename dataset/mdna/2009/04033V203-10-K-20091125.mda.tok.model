customers may generally subscribe to our software products and services for a specified term and or pay for services on a time and materials or milestone basis  depending upon their business requirements 
our revenue is comprised of subscription and maintenance fees  and services and other fees 
subscription and maintenance revenue consists of fees charged for hosted on demand software solutions and fees for product updates and support  as well as fees paid by suppliers for access to the ariba supplier network 
services and other revenue consists of fees for implementation services  consulting services  managed services  training  education  premium support  license fees charged for the use of our software products under perpetual agreements and other miscellaneous items 

table of contents due to the different treatment of our revenue streams under applicable accounting guidance  each type of revenue has a different impact on our consolidated financial statements 
subscription fees for hosted on demand software solutions are generally fixed for a specific period of time  and revenue is recognized ratably over the term 
similarly  maintenance fees are generally fixed for a specific period of time  and revenue is customarily recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
most of our customers renew their maintenance contracts annually to continue receiving product updates and product support 
given the ratable revenue recognition and historically high renewal rates of our subscription and maintenance agreements  this revenue stream has generally been stable over time 
services revenues are driven by a contract  project or statement of work  in which the fees may be fixed for specific services to be provided over time or billed on a time and materials basis 
individual subscription software license sales can be significant greater than million and sales cycles are often lengthy and difficult to predict 
these different revenue streams also carry different gross margins 
revenue from subscription and maintenance fees tends to be higher margin revenue with gross margins typically around to 
subscription and maintenance fees are generally based on software products developed by us  which carry minimal marginal cost to reproduce and sell 
revenue from labor intensive services and other fees tends to be lower margin revenue  with gross margins typically in the to range 
our overall gross margins could fluctuate from period to period depending upon the mix of revenue 
for example  a period with a higher mix of subscription revenue versus services revenue would drive overall gross margin higher and vice versa 
overview of fiscal year our revenues increased to million in the year ended september  compared to million in the year ended september  subscription and maintenance revenues increased million  or  partially offset by a decrease in services and other revenues of million  or 
subscription revenues were million in the year ended september   as compared to million in the year ended september  this is primarily due to an increase in the organic demand for our subscription software products  including on demand software solutions and fees paid for access to the ariba supplier network  and the acquisition of procuri in december services and other revenues decreased primarily due to declines in implementation revenues and perpetual license revenues in the year ended september  operating expenses decreased to million in the year ended september  compared to million in the year ended september  the decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense due to a decrease in headcount associated with restructuring initiatives in fiscal year  a decrease in stock based compensation expense due to a decrease in restricted stock grants in the year ended september   a decline in legal expenses associated with patent infringement matters and an insurance reimbursement of million in the year ended september  these amounts were partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses related to the strengthening of the us dollar in the year ended september  and an increase in bonus expense primarily associated with financial results for the year ended september  additionally  the compensation committee of our board of directors decided to eliminate bonuses for executives and reduce bonuses for certain key employees in the year ended september  in summation  our total net expenses  including cost of revenue and other items  decreased to million compared to million in the year ended september   which resulted in net income for the year ended september  of million compared to a net loss of million in the year ended september  outlook for fiscal year with the increase in our backlog and continued shift in demand toward subscription software sales  we expect continued growth in subscription revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year but at a lower growth rate than in we also expect total revenues to grow in fiscal year compared to fiscal year at a comparable growth rate as with growth in subscription revenue being partially offset by modest declines in maintenance and services and other revenues 

table of contents we plan to continue to carefully monitor expenses in fiscal year we expect that total expenses  excluding expenses for amortization of intangibles  stock based compensation and restructuring and integration  will grow  if at all  at a lower rate than revenues 
our expense outlook includes targeted investments in our business that are planned depending on economic conditions in fiscal year as a result of our revenue and expense outlooks  we anticipate continued improvement in our results from operations  before giving effect to these excluded expenses 
the current economic downturn may continue to adversely impact our business 
although we believe that our spend management solutions may be even more strategic to customers during adverse economic conditions  because they help companies reduce the costs of their goods and services  a weakening global economy  or decline in confidence in the economy  could  among other things  result in reduced revenues  impairment of financial and non financial assets and reduced cash flows 
we believe that our success for fiscal year will depend largely on our ability to renew our subscription or time based revenues  including on demand software fees  maintenance fees  and fees for certain services  sell bundled solution offerings that include both technology and expert services  and capitalize on new revenue opportunities  such as fees for the ariba supplier network and selling on demand spend management solutions to smaller and mid market customers 
in addition to the impact of global economic downturn  we believe that key risks to our revenues in fiscal year include our ability to renew ratable revenue streams without substantial declines from prior arrangements  including subscription software  software maintenance and subscription services  our ability to generate organic growth  the market acceptance of spend management solutions as a standalone market category  the overall level of information technology spending  and potential further declines in average selling prices 
we believe that key risks to our future operating profitability include our ability to maintain or grow our revenues  our ability to maintain adequate utilization of our services organization  and our ability to find new tenants for abandoned space 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties

and the substantial liquidation of the entity in the year ended september  provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of million   and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the increase in the year ended september  and the decrease in the year ended september  was primarily attributable to a recovery of foreign income taxes in the year ended september  related to taxes paid in the year ended september  as of september   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal  state and foreign tax purposes of approximately billion  million and million  respectively  before consideration of any annual limitations as described below 
the federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years from fiscal year through fiscal year  from fiscal year through fiscal year and from fiscal year through fiscal year  respectively 
utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations imposed by internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of our federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
as of september   we had research credit carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal research credit carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal year through fiscal year the state research credit carryforwards will continue indefinitely  except for approximately  which will expire in fiscal year we also had manufacturer s credit carryforwards as of september  for state tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in various years from fiscal year through fiscal year our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards include net operating loss and research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  generated by freemarkets  which are subject to annual limitations which could reduce or defer the utilization of those losses and credits 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million in restricted cash  for total cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash of million 
our working capital on september  was million 
as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million in restricted cash  for total cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash of million 
our working deficit on september  was million 
all significant cash  cash equivalents and investments are held in accounts in the united states 
we hold a variety of interest bearing ars that represent investments in pools of assets  including student loans  commercial paper and credit derivative products 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the continuing uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
given the failures in the auction markets  as well as the lack of any correlation of these instruments to other observable market data  there are no longer observable inputs available as defined by levels and of the fair value hierarchy by which to value these securities 
therefore  these auction rate securities are classified within level and their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities 
contractual maturity dates for these ars investments range from to the ars backed by student loans are guaranteed by the us government and have credit ratings of aaa 
all of the ars investments were in compliance with our investment policy at the time of acquisition and are investment grade quality  except for one commercial paper and credit derivative product that maintains a split rating between investment and speculative grade 
currently  we have no intent to sell these ars investments prior to recovery nor are aware of any factors that would make such a sale of the ars investments more likely than not 
as of september  and  we classified the entire ars investment balance as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet because of our inability to determine when our investments in ars would settle 
typically the fair value of ars investments approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model dcf to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of september  significant estimates used in the dcf models were the credit quality of the instruments  the types of instruments and an illiquidity discount factor 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
the discount factor used for the million of student loan securities and million of commercial paper and credit derivative products was adjusted by basis points bps for the student loan securities and between bps and bps for the commercial paper and credit derivative products  respectively  to reflect the then current market conditions for instruments with similar credit quality at the date of valuation and the risk in the marketplace for these investments that has arisen due to the lack of an active market for these instruments 
based on this assessment of fair value  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of its ars investments of million  of which million was deemed temporary 
as a result of the credit rating reduction to below investment grade related to one of its ars  we recorded an other than temporary impairment of million in the year ended september  as a result of adopting 
table of contents changes issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb to fair value accounting and the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  we evaluated the previously recorded other than temporary impairment loss of million 
based upon the analysis completed  we determined that the other than temporary loss of million was principally related to the credit loss on the investment 
we review our impairments in accordance with the changes issued by the fasb to fair value accounting and the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
the differentiating factors between temporary and other than temporary impairment are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in market value 
if the issuers of the ars are unable to successfully close future auctions or refinance their debt in the near term and or the credit ratings of these instruments deteriorate  we may  in the future  conclude that an additional other than temporary impairment charge is required related to these investments 
such other than temporary impairment may be greater than the million currently accounted for as a temporary decline or may be greater than the million other than temporary impairment recorded in the year ended september  the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income loss or to record all current and any future unrealized losses as a charge in our statement of operations in future quarters 
we continue to monitor the market for ars transactions and consider their impact if any on the fair value of our investments 
our investments are intended to establish a high quality portfolio that preserves principal  meets liquidity needs  avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions 
we have modified our current investment strategy by limiting our investments in ars to our current holdings and increasing our investments in more liquid investments 
the increase in total cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash of million and the increase in working capital of million in the year ended september  was primarily attributable to a million insurance reimbursement  an increase in cash collections from our customers in the year ended september  based on the percent increase in revenues in the current year  and restructuring and cost cutting initiatives in the year ended september  our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers related to our hosted on demand software solutions and fees for product updates and support  as well as fees paid by suppliers for the ariba supplier network 
we also generate cash inflows from services for implementation services  consulting services and license fees charged for the use of our software products under perpetual agreements 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures as well as payments related to leased facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended september  cash flows provided by operating activities increased million primarily due to an improvement in net

these amounts were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expense due to timing of payments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended september  cash flows provided by operating activities increased million primarily due an increase in cash flows from operating activities associated with the management of our accounts payable which resulted in a decrease of million in prepaid expenses and an increase from improved results of operations  excluding non cash charges  partially offset by an increase of million in cash payments for restructuring obligations  primarily associated with severance benefit costs in connection with our acquisition of procuri

as of september   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations our primary contractual obligations are under our operating leases and letters of credit  which are discussed below 
in march  we entered into a facility lease agreement for  square feet in four office buildings and an amenities building in sunnyvale  california for our headquarters 
the operating lease term commenced in and ends in january we occupy  square feet in this facility  and currently sublease over two 
table of contents buildings totaling  square feet to third parties 
these subleases expire in january the remaining  square feet is available for sublease 
minimum monthly lease payments are million and escalate annually  with the total future minimum lease payments amounting to million over the remaining lease term 
as part of this lease agreement  we are required to issue standby letters of credit backed by cash equivalents  totaling million as of september   as a form of security through fiscal year also  we are required by other lease agreements to hold an additional  of standby letters of credit  which are cash collateralized 
these instruments are issued by our banks in lieu of a cash security deposit required by landlords for domestic and international real estate leases 
the total cash collateral of million is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we also occupy  square feet of office space in pittsburgh  pennsylvania under a lease that expires in december this location consists principally of our services organization and administrative activities 
we occupy approximately  square feet of office space in atlanta  georgia under a lease that expires in june  our operations at this location consist principally of our sales and support activities 
future minimum lease payments and sublease income under noncancelable operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of september  in thousands year ending september  lease payments contractual sublease income net obligations thereafter total the above table represents our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the specific timing and actual amounts of payments 
of the total operating lease commitments as of september  noted above  million is for occupied properties and million is for abandoned properties  which are a component of the restructuring obligation 
other than the lease commitments and letters of credit discussed above  we do not have commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations or other such debt arrangements 
we do not have any material noncancelable purchase commitments as of september  off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated limited purpose entities  nor do we have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 
anticipated cash flows we expect to incur significant operating costs  particularly related to services delivery costs  sales and marketing  research and development and restructuring costs  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that such operating costs will constitute a use of our cash resources 
as a result  our 
table of contents net cash flows will depend heavily on the level of future sales  changes in deferred revenues  our ability to manage infrastructure costs  the outcome of our subleasing activities related to abandoned excess leased facilities and ongoing regulatory and legal proceedings 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  should be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource requirements for at least the next twelve months 
should we find it necessary to obtain additional funds  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all

application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and  in part  are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring obligations related to abandoned operating leases  the fair value of certain investments and contingencies related to the collectability of accounts receivable 
these policies and our practices related to these policies are described below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenues are derived from two sources i providing software solutions on either a multi tenant or single tenant basis and technical support and product updates  otherwise known as subscription and maintenance  and ii providing services  including implementation services  consulting services  training  education  premium support and other miscellaneous services 
the significant majority of our standard end user license agreements provide for use of our software under a time based license based on the number of users or other usage criteria 
we license our software in multiple element arrangements in which the customer typically purchases a combination of some or all of the following i software solutions  either on a standalone or on demand basis  ii a maintenance arrangement  which is generally priced as a percentage of the software license fees and provides for technical support and unspecified product updates typically over a period of one year or over the term of the license  and iii a services arrangement  on either a fixed fee for access to specific services over time or a time and materials basis 
we license our products through our direct sales force and indirectly through resellers 
sales made through resellers are generally recognized at the time that we have received persuasive evidence of an end user customer 
the license agreements for our products generally do not provide for a right of return  and historically product returns have not been significant 
we do not recognize revenue for refundable fees or agreements with cancellation rights until such rights to refund or cancel have expired 
direct sales force commissions are included as sales and marketing expense at the time of sale  when the liability is incurred and is reasonably estimable 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product or service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
if fees are not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized when fees are due and payable 
if collectability is not considered probable at the inception of the arrangement  we do not recognize revenue until the fee is collected 

table of contents we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on its respective fair value 
our determination of the fair value of each element in a multiple element arrangement is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which is limited to the price when sold separately 
revenue from software solutions  hosting and sourcing solutions services is primarily recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  commencing with the initial customer access date 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue allocated to software solutions implementation  process improvement  training and other services is recognized as the services are performed or as milestones are achieved or if bundled with a subscription or time based service  or in circumstances where fair value cannot be established for undelivered service elements  is recognized ratably over the term of the access agreement 
certain of our contracts include performance incentive payments based on market volume and or savings generated  as defined in the respective contracts 
revenue from such arrangements is recognized when those thresholds are achieved 
when revenue associated with multiple element arrangements is recognized and one element in that arrangement has fair value  we first allocate revenue on the statement of operations to those elements for which evidence of fair value is available and the residual is allocated to those elements that do not have fair value 
in circumstances where we provide consulting services as part of a multi element arrangement with software solutions  both the software solution revenue and service revenue are recognized under the lesser of proportional performance method based on hours or ratable over the term of the license 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized  and generally results from deferred subscription  maintenance and support  hosting  consulting or training services not yet rendered and license revenue deferred until all requirements are met 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product  as services are rendered  or as other requirements are satisfied 
deferred revenue excludes contract amounts for which payment has yet to be collected 
likewise  accounts receivable excludes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been deferred 
recoverability of goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired and that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreases in our market capitalization below the recorded amount of our net assets for a sustained period 
our stock price is highly volatile and has experienced significant declines in the past 
we performed the annual assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal years  and and no indication of goodwill impairment was noted 
the balance of goodwill is million as of september   and there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 

table of contents lease abandonment costs we initially recorded a significant restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal year upon abandoning certain operating leases as part of a program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
in the years ended september     and  we revised our original estimates and expectations for our corporate headquarters and field offices disposition efforts as a result of changed estimates of sublease rental projections 
during the year ended september   we recorded a net benefit to operations of million 
in june  we entered into an amendment with juniper  the successor in interest to netscreen to the sublease dated as of october  between ariba and netscreen 
pursuant to the amendment  juniper agreed to renew its sublease of approximately  square feet of space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january in addition  juniper agreed  effective october   to lease approximately  square feet of additional space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january also in june  we revised our estimates for rental rate projections and sub lease commencement dates to reflect current market conditions primarily in the northern california real estate market 
the impact of the execution of the sublease agreement with juniper was a benefit to operations of approximately million and the impact of the revised estimated rental rate projections and sub lease commencement dates was a charge to operations of million  resulting in a net benefit to operations of million in the year ended september  during the year ended september   we recorded a charge to operations of million 
during the year  we evaluated our space in sunnyvale  california headquarters  and ceased use of approximately  square feet and recorded lease abandonment costs of million and leasehold impairments of million 
we also recorded a charge in the year ended september  related to severance benefit costs of approximately million in connection with our acquisition of procuri and to better align our expenses with our revenues and to enable our investment in certain growth initiatives 
these amounts were partially offset by a benefit to operations of  primarily related to an agreement with efficient frontier to sublease approximately  square feet of space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january the remaining benefit during the year was for property taxes of approximately  related to abandoned facilities in california based on a revised property tax assessment and notice of refund received in june related to fiscal years through we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the year ended september  during the year  we revised our estimates for sublease commencement dates and sublease rental rate projections to reflect continued soft market conditions in the northern california real estate market  resulting in a charge of million 
we also recorded a charge in the year ended september  related to severance benefit costs of million in connection with workforce reductions in the current economic environment to better align our expenses and our revenues 
lease abandonment costs for the abandoned facilities were estimated to include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable subleasees and sublease rates using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by us 
we review these estimates each quarterly reporting period  and to the extent that our assumptions change  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary significantly from current estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our lease abandonment accrual is net of million of estimated sublease income 
actual sublease payments due under noncancelable subleases of excess facilities totaled million as of september  and the remainder of anticipated sublease income represents management s estimate of amounts to be received under future subleases 
actual future cash requirements and lease abandonment costs may differ materially from the accrual at september   particularly if actual sublease income is significantly different from current estimates 
these differences could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash position 
for 
table of contents example  a reduction in assumed market lease rates of per square foot per month for the remaining term of the lease  with all other assumptions remaining the same  would increase the estimated lease abandonment loss on our sunnyvale  california headquarters by approximately million as of september  fair value of auction rate securities we hold a variety of interest bearing ars that represent investments in pools of assets  including student loans  commercial paper and credit derivative products 
as of september   we held million in par value of student loan securities that failed to settle in auctions commencing february and million in par value of commercial paper and credit derivative products that failed to settle in auctions commencing august these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as either a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
given the failures in the auction markets  as well as the lack of any correlation of these instruments to other observable market data  there are no longer observable inputs available as defined by levels and of the fair value hierarchy by which to value these securities 
therefore  these auction rate securities are classified within level and their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities 
contractual maturity dates for these ars investments range from to the ars backed by student loans are guaranteed by the us government and have credit ratings of aaa 
the ars investments were in compliance with our investment policy at the time of acquisition and are investment grade quality  except for one commercial paper and credit derivative product that maintains a split rating between investment and speculative grade 
currently  we have no intent to sell these ars investments prior to recovery nor are aware of any factors that would make such a sale of the ars investments more likely than not 
as of september   we have classified the entire ars investment balance as long term investments on its consolidated balance sheet because of its current inability to predict that these investments will be available for settlement within the next twelve months 
we have also modified its current investment strategy and increased its investments in more liquid money market instruments 
historically  the fair value of ars investments approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continues to earn interest on its ars investments at the contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow dcf model to determine the estimated fair value of its investment in ars as of september  significant estimates used in the dcf models were the credit quality of the instruments  the types of instruments and an illiquidity discount factor 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
the discount factor used for the million of student loan securities and million of commercial paper and credit derivative products was adjusted by basis points bps for the student loan securities and between bps and bps for the commercial paper and credit derivative products  respectively  to reflect the then current market conditions for instruments with similar credit quality at the date of valuation and the risk in the marketplace for these investments that has arisen due to the lack of an active market for these instruments 
based on this assessment of fair value  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of its ars investments of million  of which million was deemed temporary 
as a result of the credit rating reduction to below investment grade related to one of its ars  we recorded an other than temporary 
table of contents impairment of million in the year ended september  as a result of adopting changes issued by the fasb to fair value accounting and the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments that were effective for the third quarter of fiscal year  we evaluated the recorded other than temporary impairment loss of million 
based upon the analysis completed  we determined that the other than temporary loss of million was principally related to the credit loss on the investment 
additionally  we evaluated the factors related to other than credit loss  which were determined to be immaterial to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
we review our impairments in accordance with the changes issued by the fasb to fair value accounting and the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
the differentiating factors between temporary and other than temporary impairment are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in market value to par 
if the issuers of the ars are unable to successfully close future auctions or refinance their debt in the near term and or the credit ratings of these instruments deteriorate  we may  in the near future  conclude that an additional other than temporary impairment charge is required related to these investments 
such other than temporary impairment may be greater than the million currently accounted for as a temporary decline or may be greater than the million other than temporary impairment recorded in the year ended september  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide for actual losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts might be required 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for the remaining customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the aggregate receivables are outstanding  the current business environment and historical experience 
alternatively  if the financial condition of our customers were to improve such that their ability to make payments was no longer considered impaired  we would reduce related estimated reserves with a credit to the provision for doubtful accounts

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we develop products primarily in the united states and india and market our products primarily in the united states  europe and asia 
as a result  our financial results have been and could in the future be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since the majority of our non us sales are priced in currencies other than the non us dollar  a strengthening of the dollar may reduce the level of reported revenues 
if any of the events described above were to continue to occur  our net sales could be seriously impacted  since a large portion of our net sales are derived from international operations 
for the years ended september   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales were derived from customers outside of the united states 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we utilize forward contracts to reduce our net exposures  by currency  related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign operations denominated in local currency 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  all of these instruments are marked to market at each balance sheet date by a charge to earnings 
we believe that these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts are generally offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 
the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of september  in thousands buy sell contract value unrealized gain loss in usd foreign currency usd foreign currency euro sell   singapore dollar sell   chinese renminbi sell   japanese yen buy   swiss franc buy   czech koruna buy  brazilian real sell  total the unrealized gain loss represents the difference between the contract value and the market value of the contract based on market rates as of september  given our foreign exchange position  a ten percent change in foreign exchange rates upon which these forward exchange contracts are based would result in unrealized exchange gains or losses of approximately million 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange losses or gains on the underlying net monetary exposures 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from other foreign currency exposures 

table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
we hold investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  and both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investments may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and as such we may suffer losses at the time of sale due to the decline in market value 
the table below represents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity of our investment portfolio in thousands  except for interest rates
