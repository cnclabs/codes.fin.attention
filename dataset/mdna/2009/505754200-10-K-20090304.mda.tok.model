item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview was a significant year in the year history of ladish 
the company made meaningful progress in positioning itself for long term growth by the actions it took  both internally and externally  during the course of to support organic expansion  ladish spent a record million on capital expenditures in the year 
this capital was directed mainly toward completing the new  ton isothermal forging press at forging  installing a new melting furnace and facility expansion at pct and added machining and inspection facilities at zkm and valley 
externally  ladish made two key strategic acquisitions with the purchases of aerex and chen tech 
the acquisition of aerex  with its finishing machining expertise  solidifies ladish s position in the supply chain for helicopter components 
chen tech brings additional hot die forging expertise and increased market share for jet engine components on single aisle and regional aircraft 
collectively  the capital expenditures and acquisitions have provided ladish with at least million of new capacity for growth in some of the company s most profitable market niches 
while ladish was positioning itself for market growth and capacity expansion in  ladish was not immune from two major  negative external events in the aerospace industry 
the global economic financial downturn and resultant credit crisis have not impacted the aerospace industry as much as others  but there has been an effect and ladish has felt it 
also  the prolonged labor strike at boeing in the second half of had a negative result for suppliers such as ladish as shipments were deferred and production schedules were adjusted on numerous occasions 
in the face of the foregoing challenges  ladish did manage to ship million of product in in spite of an increase in net sales in  earnings declined for a number of reasons 
largely due to the credit crisis and the boeing strike  the product mix at ladish shifted unfavorably at ladish as jet engine components went from of sales to and correspondingly  industrial components increased from to of sales 
this shift in product mix toward components with lower profit margins was an impediment to earnings in ladish believes this trend will stabilize in and improve in and beyond as boeing and airbus bring new aircraft to the market and ladish is able to utilize its expanded capacity for incremental sales 
raw material remained a challenge for ladish in although performance of suppliers improved from levels  fluctuating market prices and price guarantees implemented by the company s customers disrupted the supply chain and negatively affected the company s cost of goods 
the by product market for the material ladish recycles was severely depressed in and as a result ladish did not receive a sufficient level of proceeds to offset its cost of goods  and raw material increased from to of ladish s costs 
the company benefited in from a combined tax rate of 
this lower tax rate was the result of ladish recognizing a million research and development tax credit in the third quarter of the year  a significant state tax savings from apportionment and a million foreign economic zone credit from zkm for prior investments in that operation 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales in were million  a increase over the million of net sales in the sales growth in was due to the continued strength of ladish s markets and the acquisitions of aerex and chen tech in the third quarter of in  cost of sales for the company was of net sales in comparison to of net sales in the company s sg a expense in was million  or of net sales 
in  sg a expense was of net sales 
the percentage increase in sg a expense is attributed to growth in employment to support capacity expansion and higher professional fees associated with tax planning 
in  the company s interest expense was million in comparison to million in the decrease in interest expense in was the result of a larger amount of interest capitalized associated with the capacity expansion programs at the company 
total interest increased in as the company incurred additional debt to support the acquisition of aerex and chen tech 
the following table reflects the company s treatment of interest for the years and dollars in millions interest expensed interest capitalized total pretax income in was million  an million reduction from the pretax income level 
the decline in pretax income was due to product mix and under absorbed fixed costs 
tax expense for was million  which equated to an effective tax rate of 
in  the company experienced an effective tax rate of 
the reduction in tax rate is mainly attributed to the company recognizing a significant tax savings from the recognition of a million research and development tax credit in the third quarter of and a million foreign economic zone credit 
net income in was million  which equates to per share on a fully diluted basis 
net income was similar to levels but declined as a percentage of sales due to higher raw material and energy costs  a less profitable mix of products sold and inefficiencies associated with expanding manufacturing capacity  offset by the aforementioned tax savings and the capitalization of interest expense to capital projects 
the company booked million of new orders in in comparison to million of new orders in the decline in orders was associated with the boeing labor stoppage in the third quarter of and general  global economic conditions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for were million in comparison to million of net sales in fiscal the year over year increase in net sales was attributable to a sales increase in jet engine components  a sales increase in aerospace components and a sales increase in industrial components 
for  all of the markets served by the company showed continued strength and high demand for the products manufactured by the company 
cost of sales was of net sales in in contrast to of net sales in the higher cost of sales in is attributed to higher raw material costs in sg a expense for fiscal was million  or of net sales 
in  sg a expense was million  or of net sales 
the reduction in sg a expense  both in total dollars and as a percentage of net sales  is due to the company using internal staffing for international sales  a reduction in professional fees and a continued cost reduction effort 
interest expense in was million in comparison to million in the reduction in interest expense in was due to lower debt levels and the capitalization of that portion of interest associated with capital projects at the company 
the following table reflects the company s treatment of interest for the years and dollars in millions interest expensed interest capitalized total for  the company had million of pretax income  a increase over the million of pretax income earned by the company in the rise in pretax income is attributable to the increased volume of net sales in  operating efficiencies and a more profitable mix of product in the company recognized a tax expense of million in for federal  state and foreign taxes 
the effective tax rate in is a decrease from the effective tax rate used for the rate decrease in was a reflection of the company reversing a valuation allowance at zkm and recognizing a tax asset in net income for was million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  in comparison to million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  of net income in the growth of net income comes from higher net sales  operating efficiencies and product mix along with a slightly lower effective tax rate in new orders of million were booked by the company in in comparison to million of new orders in this resulted in the company ending with million of contract backlog in comparison to million of contract backlog at the end of the increase in orders and resulting contract backlog in is a reflection of the overall strength in all three of the primary markets served by the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position as of december  is million less than its position at december  the decrease in cash is due to million in capital expenditures  pension contributions and decreased payables partially offset by decreases in inventory and receivables 
cash flow from operations in was million less than cash flow from operations in primarily due to million of increased cash pension contributions 
on july   the company sold million of series a notes in a private placement to certain institutional investors 
the series a notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of per annum with the interest being paid semiannually 
the series a notes have a seven year duration with the principal amortizing equally over the duration after the third year 
amortization payments of million annually were made on july  through  at which time the series a notes were retired 
on may   the company sold million of series b notes in a private placement to certain institutional investors 
the series b notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of per annum with interest being paid semiannually 
the series b notes have a ten year duration with the principal amortizing equally over the duration after the fourth year 
on september   the company sold million of series c notes in a private placement to certain institutional investors 
the series c notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of per annum with interest being paid semiannually 
the series c notes have a seven year duration with the principal amortizing equally over the duration after the third year 
in addition  the company and a syndicate of lenders have entered into a million revolving line of credit the facility which was most recently renewed on april  the facility bears interest at a rate of libor plus or at a base rate 
at december   there were million of borrowings under the facility and million of credit was available pursuant to the terms of the facility 
the facility has a maturity date of april  the company expects to renew the facility on similar terms  as it has for each of the past nine years 
during  the company applied million of cash for capital expenditures and million of cash for acquisitions 
these expenditures were funded by million of cash from operations and borrowings under the facility and the series c notes 
in  the company issued  shares of common stock in connection with the acquisitions of aerex and chen tech 
during the years ending december  and  the company received million and million  respectively  from the exercise of employee stock options 
given the company s ability to pass along raw material price increases to its customers  inflation has not had a material effect upon the company during the period covered by this report 
given the rising demand for the products manufactured by the company  and the prospects for increases in raw material costs and possible energy cost escalation  the company cannot determine at this time if there will be any significant impact from inflation in the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations table dollars in millions less than more than year years years years senior notes bank facility operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations pensions postretirement benefits the company expects to fund the payment of long term debt through the use of cash on hand  cash generated from operations  the reduction of working capital and  if necessary  through access to the facility 
the purchase obligations relate primarily to raw material purchase orders necessary to fulfill the company s production backlog for the company s products along with commitments for energy supplies also necessary to fulfill the company s production backlog 
there are no net settlement provisions under any of these purchase orders nor is there any market for the underlying materials 
the company s estimated cash pension contribution is based upon the calculation of the company s independent actuary for there are no estimates beyond the company s cash expenditures for postretirement benefits have only been projected out through the year critical accounting policies deferred income taxes the company started with million of domestic net operating loss nol carryforwards that were generated prior to its reorganization completed on april  these nols were utilized by the company to reduce taxable income in pensions the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans plans covering a number of its employees 
the company contributed million and million  respectively  to the plans in and the company intends to contribute million  million and million to the plans in  and  respectively 
the company plans on funding those contributions from cash on hand  cash generated from operations  working capital reductions  treasury stock contributions and  if necessary  from the facility 
no estimates have been made for payments into the plans beyond the plans assets are held in a trust and are primarily invested in us government securities  investment grade corporate bonds and marketable common stocks 
the key assumptions the company considers with respect to the assets in the plans and funding the liabilities associated with the plans are the discount rate  the long term rate of return on plans assets  the projected rate of increase in compensation levels and the actuarial estimate of mortality of participants in the plans 
the most sensitive assumption is the discount rate 
for funding purposes  the company s independent actuaries assumed an annual long term rate of return on plan assets of and for and  respectively 
for the ten year period ending december   the company experienced an annual rate of return on plan assets of the company used a rate of for its discount rate assumption for  a decrease from the rate used for an increase in the discount rate results in a decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation at the measurement date which may also result in a decrease in the additional minimum pension liability included as a credit to accumulated other comprehensive income 
such an increase also results in an actuarial gain which is amortized to pension expense in accordance with fasb statement no 
a decrease in the discount rate will have the opposite effect in the pension liability and pension expense 
the company bases its discount rate on long maturity aa rated corporate debt securities 
the company cannot predict whether these interest rates will increase or decrease in future years 
the company cannot predict the level of interest rates in the future and correspondingly cannot predict the future discount rate which will be applied to determine the company s projected benefit obligation 
as demonstrated in the chart below  relatively small movements in the discount rate  up or down  can have a significant impact on the company s projected benefit obligation under the plans 
projected plan benefit obligation as of december  dollars in millions at discount rate at discount rate at discount rate nor can the company predict with any certainty what the actual rate of return will be for the plans assets 
as demonstrated in the chart below  a modest change in the presumed rate of return on the plans assets will have a material impact upon the actual net periodic cost for the plans 
net periodic cost for year ending december  dollars in millions expected return expected return expected return goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the cost of acquired net assets in excess of their fair market values 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a two step impairment test is required to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then goodwill is not impaired and the second step is not required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
for the purpose of goodwill analysis  the company has only one reporting segment  as defined by sfas no 
goodwill of million represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets relating to business acquisitions 
goodwill increased significantly in due to the acquisitions of aerex and chen tech 
it is an asset with an indefinite life and therefore is not amortized to expense  but is subject to annual impairment testing 
the company tests the goodwill for impairment at least annually by fair value impairment testing 
the company s assessment of fair value used in the annual impairment testing takes into account a number of factors including ebitda multiples of transactions in the company s industry as well as fair market value multiples of transactions of similarly situated enterprises 
no impairments were recognized in or should goodwill become impaired in the future  the amount of impairment will be charged to sg a expense 
the company has million of amortizable customer relationships included in other intangible assets that will be amortized over years with annual amortization of million
