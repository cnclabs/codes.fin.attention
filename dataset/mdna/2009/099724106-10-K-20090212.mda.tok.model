results by reporting segment the company s business is comprised of two reporting segments engine and drivetrain 
these segments are strategic business groups  which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems 
the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after tax return on invested capital roic of its business initiatives 
the roic is comprised of projected earnings before interest and taxes ebit adjusted for taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required 
ebit is considered a non gaap financial measure 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebit is defined as earnings before interest  taxes and minority interest 
earnings is intended to mean net earnings as presented in the consolidated statements of operations under gaap 
the company believes that ebit is useful to demonstrate the operational profitability of its segments by excluding interest and taxes  which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis 
ebit is also one of the measures used by the company to determine resource allocation within the company 
although the company believes that ebit enhances understanding of its business and performance  it should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net earnings or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with gaap

table of contents environmental the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund and equivalent state laws and  as such  may presently be liable for the cost of clean up and other remedial activities at such sites 
responsibility for clean up and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
the company believes that none of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
generally  this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared with other prps  although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 
based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent public companies  will fully pay the cost apportioned to them  currently available information from prps and or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs  remediation alternatives  and estimated legal fees  the company has established an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december  of million 
the company has accrued amounts that do not exceed million related to any individual site and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years 
in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation  the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities  then unknown to the company  relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that pre date the company s acquisition of kuhlman electric 
during  kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs  mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant 
the company is continuing to work with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary  historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area 
kuhlman electric and others  including the company  were sued in numerous related lawsuits  in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage 
in  the company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately of the then known personal injury and property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental contamination 
those settlements involved payments by the company of million in the second half of and million in the first quarter of  in exchange for  among other things  dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits 
in december  a lawsuit was filed against kuhlman electric and others  including the company  on behalf of approximately plaintiffs  alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination 
in august  two similar lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others  including the company  on behalf of approximately plaintiffs and plaintiffs  respectively  alleging personal injury related to the alleged environmental contamination 
given the early stage of the litigation  the company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome  but its current intent is to vigorously defend against the suits 
conditional asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued interpretation no

certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished 
the liability exists because the facility will not last forever  but it is 
table of contents conditional on future renovations even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials  which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition 
similarly  government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks usts and above ground storage tanks asts when their use ceases  the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb transformers and capacitors when their use ceases  and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners  and lead based paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition 
the company currently has manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items 
the fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at million as of december  and million as of december  product liability like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us  the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos related personal injury actions 
we believe that the company s involvement is limited because  in general  these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos 
the nature of the fibers  the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm 
as of december  and  the company had approximately  and  pending asbestos related product liability claims  respectively 
of the  outstanding claims at december   approximately  are pending in just three jurisdictions  where significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway 
the company s policy is to aggressively defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment 
the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos related product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers 
in  of the approximately  claims resolved  only resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 
in  of the approximately  claims resolved  only resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 
prior to june  the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were covered by the company s primary layer insurance coverage  and these carriers administered  defended  settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement 
in june  primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits 
this led the company to access the next available layer of insurance coverage 
since june  secondary layer insurers have paid asbestos related litigation defense and settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement 
to date  the company has paid million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received million in cash from insurers 
the outstanding balance of million is expected to be fully recovered 
timing of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to below 
at december   insurers owed million in association with these claims 
at december   the company has an estimated liability of million for future claims resolutions  with a related asset of million to recognize the insurance proceeds receivable by the company for estimated losses related to claims that have yet to be resolved 
insurance carrier reimbursement of is expected based on the company s experience  its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to below 
at december   the comparable value of the insurance receivable and accrued liability was million 

table of contents the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows millions of dollars assets prepayments and other current assets other non current assets total insurance receivable liabilities accounts payable and accrued expenses other non current liabilities total accrued liability the company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses  if any  in excess of those for which it has accrued  because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future  the allegations in such claims  the possible outcomes  or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 
a declaratory judgment action was filed in january in the circuit court of cook county  illinois by continental casualty company and related companies cna against the company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers

the lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage available to the company including whether the available limits exhaust on a per occurrence or an aggregate basis  and to determine how the applicable coverage responsibilities should be apportioned 
on august   the court issued an interim order regarding the apportionment matter 
the interim order has the effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and settlement costs pro rata to time on the risk  with the pro ration method to hold the insured harmless for periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage 
appeals of the interim order were denied 
however  the issue is reserved for appellate review at the end of the action 
in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos related claims  the company has substantial additional layers of insurance available for potential future asbestos related product claims 
as such  the company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities 
although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels  due to the encapsulated nature of the products  the company s experiences in aggressively defending and resolving claims in the past  and the company s significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing  management does not believe that asbestos related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  relating to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  which is usually upon shipment of product 
although the company may enter into long term supply agreements with its major customers  each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the price is not fixed over the life of the agreements 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  whether held for use or disposal  including other intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable  however  changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the evaluations 
significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long lived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review  and ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset 
the company recognized million and million in impairment of long lived assets as part of restructuring expenses in and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company s and impairment of long lived assets 
goodwill the company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units  or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review utilizes the two step impairment test required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  and requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates and growth rates 
the cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time  which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty 
we also utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios  which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable 
however  different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value 
the goodwill impairment test was performed in december and september  december and december the company recognized goodwill impairment of million in the engine segment in and million in the drivetrain segment in no goodwill impairment was recorded in see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 
environmental accrual we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites 
the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability 
management s estimate of the loss range for environmental liability  including conditional asset retirement obligations  for is between million and million 
we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined  in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range 
at the end of  our total accrued environmental liability was million  which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under fin of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 

table of contents product warranty the company provides warranties on some of its products 
the warranty terms are typically from one to three years 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claim settlements  as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties 
management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the accrual 
the accrual is represented in both current and non current liabilities on the balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranty 
other loss accruals and valuation allowances the company has numerous other loss exposures  such as customer claims  workers compensation claims  litigation  and recoverability of assets 
establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization 
we estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 
pension and other post employment defined benefits the company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees 
costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees  retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 
the company s employee defined benefit pension and post employment health care expenses are dependent on management s assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 
the company s approach to establishing the discount rate is based upon the market yields of high quality corporate bonds  with appropriate consideration of each plan s defined benefit payment terms and duration of the liabilities 
the discount rate assumption is typically rounded up or down to the nearest basis points for each plan 
as a sensitivity measure for the company s pension plans  a decrease of basis points to the discount rate would increase the company s expense by approximately million 
as for the company s other post employment benefit plans  a decrease of basis points to the discount rate would increase the company s expense by approximately million 
the company determines its expected return on plan asset assumptions by evaluating estimates of future market returns and the plans asset allocation 
the company also considers the impact of active management of the plans invested assets 
the company s expected return on assets assumption reflects the asset allocation of each plan 
for  the company is changing its expected return on us plan assets to from to reflect adjustments made to its targeted asset allocations 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point decrease in the long term return on assets would increase the pension expense by approximately million 
the company determines its health care inflation rate for its other post employment benefit plans by evaluating the circumstances surrounding the plan design  recent experience and health care economics 
for sensitivity purposes  a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend would increase the 
table of contents company s projected benefit obligation by million at december   and would increase the expense by million 
based on the information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources  the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions  or experience different from that assumed  could impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents foreign operating and other loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain 
management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 
since future financial results may differ from previous estimates  periodic adjustments to the company s valuation allowance may be necessary 
the company is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous non us jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain 
the company is regularly under audit by the various applicable tax authorities 
accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the company s federal and certain state income tax returns and certain non us income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments  if any  which may be proposed by the taxing authorities 
at december   the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions  which is included in other non current liabilities 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes

fas r is effective for the company beginning with its year ending december  the company is currently assessing the potential impacts  if any  on its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued staff position and financial interpretation r  disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities fsp and fin r 
fsp and fin r requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how an entity accounts for transfers of financial assets  the nature of involvement  if any  after the financial asset sale and the nature of any restrictions on assets reported by an entity in its statement of financial position that relates to a transferred financial asset  including the carrying amounts of such assets 
the company has adjusted its disclosures to be compliant with fsp and fin r at december  qualitative and quantitive disclosure about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations 
some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers 
other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies  which include forward contracts 
the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses 
we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 
we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk  which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs 
the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges 
at the end of  the amount of net debt with fixed interest rates was of total debt  including the impact of the interest rate swaps 
our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre tax interest expense for of approximately million  and million in we also measure interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous change in interest rates as of december   the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million if interest rates decreased and would decrease by approximately million if interest rates increased 
our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves 
the model  therefore  does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity at december   measured in a similar manner  was slightly less than at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
currently  our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound  the euro  the hungarian forint  the japanese yen  and the south korean won 
we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve  by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps 
such non us dollar debt was million as of december  and million as of december  we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing 
table of contents economic and political environments 
in addition  the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
as of december   the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of million and million  respectively  of which million in gains and million in losses mature in less than one year 
as of december   million in gains and million in losses did not qualify for deferral 
commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products 
commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components 
as of december   the company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of million 
as of december   the company was holding commodity derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of million and million  respectively  of which million in gains and million in losses mature in less than one year
