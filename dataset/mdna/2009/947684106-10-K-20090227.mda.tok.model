item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
see item a risk factors above regarding certain factors known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results 
overview we are a leading provider of web filtering and security  data loss prevention dlp  and email anti spam and security solutions

since we commenced operations in  websense has evolved from a reseller of computer security products to a leading provider of content security software solutions  including web security  dlp  email and messaging security solutions 
our first web filtering software product was released in and prevented access to inappropriate web content 
since then  we have focused on adapting our web filtering capabilities to address changing internet use patterns and the growing incidence of web based criminal activity 
during  we derived of our revenue from international sales  compared with for  with the united kingdom comprising approximately and approximately of our total revenue in and  respectively 
we believe international markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity and we are continuing to expand our international operations  particularly in selected countries in the european  asia pacific  latin american and australian markets 
we utilize a two tier distribution strategy in north america to sell our products  with an objective of increasing the number of value added resellers selling our products and further extending our reach into the small and medium sized business market segment 
our distribution strategy outside north america also relies on a multi tiered system of distributors and value added resellers 
sales through indirect channels currently account for more than of our revenue 
sales to ingram micro  a distributor who sells our products in north america through approximately  resellers  accounted for approximately of our revenue in and of our revenue in we sell subscriptions to our products  generally in  or month contract durations  based on the number of seats or devices managed 
as described elsewhere in this report  we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our products  including add on modules  on a daily straight line basis commencing on the day 
table of contents the term of the subscription begins  over the term of the subscription agreement 
we recognize the operating expenses related to these sales as they are incurred 
these operating expenses include sales commissions  which are based on the total amount of the subscription contract and are fully expensed in the period the product is delivered 
operating expenses have continued to increase as compared with prior periods due to expanded selling and marketing efforts  continued product research and development and investments in administrative infrastructure to support subscription sales that we will recognize as revenue in subsequent periods 
in october  we closed our acquisition of surfcontrol and as a result incurred an operating loss under gaap during the fourth quarter of and for the fiscal years and similar to websense  surfcontrol sold products primarily under subscriptions whereby revenues were recorded ratably over the term of the agreement 
under purchase accounting  we wrote off million of the deferred revenue of surfcontrol  leaving a balance of million 
this adjustment reflects the fair value of the post contract technical support services that will be recognized daily in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
we did not expect to generate significant revenue from the installed surfcontrol customer base until the subscriptions we acquired were up for renewal 
in connection with the acquisition  we have incurred restructuring costs primarily in connection with reducing surfcontrol headcount and eliminating redundant facilities 
as of the acquisition date  we also immediately started to incur the expenses of operating the surfcontrol operations as well as recording the amortization of the acquired intangibles 
as a result  we reported a net loss for fiscal years and given the average remaining term of the surfcontrol subscriptions we acquired and the elimination of many of the non recurring acquisition related expenses  we currently expect to report income from operations for fiscal year  although not in the first half of our ability to retain surfcontrol customers when contracts are up for renewal and maintain our overall pricing levels for our products will impact our results of operations and the timing of our return to profitability 
in connection with the acquisition of surfcontrol  we approved plans to restructure the operations of the acquired company through involuntarily terminating of surfcontrol s employees and exiting certain surfcontrol facilities 
we began formulating our restructuring plans for the operations of surfcontrol in april when the acquisition was first announced 
as of december   all of the employees that we identified as being subject to the involuntary termination have been terminated and all the severance costs have been paid 
these workforce reductions were across all functions and geographies and affected employees were provided cash severance packages 
additionally  we have consolidated facilities and have exited  or will be exiting  leases in certain locations as well as reducing the square footage required to operate some locations 
our facility exit plans were finalized during fiscal year we have accrued the estimated costs associated with the employee severance and facility exit obligations as liabilities assumed in the acquisition of surfcontrol and  accordingly  included the costs as part of the purchase price of surfcontrol 
changes to the estimates of the facility exit costs will be recorded in future periods either as a reduction to goodwill or as an expense to the results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
when a purchase decision is made for our products  customers enter into a subscription agreement  which is generally  or months in duration and for a fixed number of users 
other services such as upgrades enhancements and standard post contract technical support services are sold together with our product subscription and provided throughout the subscription term 
we recognize revenue on a daily straight line basis commencing on the date the term of the subscription begins  and continuing over the 
table of contents term of the subscription agreement  provided the fee is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and collectability is reasonably assured 
upon entering into a subscription arrangement for a fixed or determinable fee  we electronically deliver access codes to users and then promptly invoice customers for the full amount of their subscriptions 
payment is due for the full term of the subscription  generally within to days of the invoice 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
for our us dollar functional currency entities  when we enter into a subscription agreement that is denominated and paid in a currency other than us dollars  we record the subscription billing and deferred revenue in us dollars based upon the currency exchange rate in effect on the last day of the previous month before the subscription agreement is effective 
changes in currency rates relative to the us dollar may have a significant impact on the revenue that we will recognize under contracts that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
we record distributor marketing payments and channel rebates as an offset to revenue 
we recognize distributor marketing payments as an offset to revenue as the marketing service is provided 
we recognize channel rebates as an offset to revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription agreement 
acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value of intangible assets  including acquired technology and customer relationships  is based on significant judgments made by management 
the valuations and useful life assumptions are based on information available near the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that are considered reasonable by management 
in our assessment of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in the portauthority and surfcontrol acquisitions  management used valuation techniques and made various assumptions 
our analysis and financial projections were based on management s prospective operating plans and the historical performance of the acquired businesses 
we engaged third party valuation firms to assist management in the following developing an understanding of the economic and competitive environment for the industry in which we and the acquired companies participate  identifying the intangible assets acquired  reviewing the acquisition agreements and other relevant documents made available  interviewing our employees  including the employees of the acquired companies  regarding the history and nature of the acquisition  historical and expected financial performance  product lifecycles and roadmap  and other factors deemed relevant to the valuation  performing additional market research and analysis deemed relevant to the valuation analysis  estimating the fair values and recommending useful lives of the acquired intangible assets  and preparing a narrative report detailing methods and assumptions used in the valuation of the intangible assets 
all work performed by the outside valuation firms was discussed and reviewed in detail by management to determine the estimated fair values of the intangible assets 
the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we review goodwill that has an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually in our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
we amortize the cost of identified 
table of contents intangible assets using amortization methods that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we review intangible assets that have finite useful lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
we review for impairment by facts or circumstances  either external or internal  indicating that we may not recover the carrying value of the asset 
we measure impairment losses related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amounts of these assets exceed their fair values 
we measure fair value under sfas  which is generally based on the estimated future cash flows 
our analysis is based on available information and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable and supportable 
if necessary  we perform subsequent calculations to measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets 
share based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r and staff accounting bulletin no 
sab requiring the measurement and recognition of all share based compensation under the fair value method 
share based compensation expense related to stock options is recorded based on the fair value of the award on its grant date which we estimate using the black scholes valuation model in accordance with the provisions prescribed under sfas r and sab share based compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans excluding tax effects 
that total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures as well as for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of approximately years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions described below 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the history of grants and exercises in our option database 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both the historical volatility as well as the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  consistent with sfas r and sab we base the risk free interest rate that is used in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we amortize the fair value ratably over the vesting period of the awards  which is typically four years 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future or select a different option valuation model altogether  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share in the future 
we determine the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in management s opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r and sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 

table of contents income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with prevailing law and practice 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction  the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to pay their invoices 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods shown

table of contents year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenue revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was a result primarily of additional customer seats in new  renewed and upgraded subscriptions including an increase of million from new or renewed surfcontrol seat subscriptions and an increase of million of revenue recognized from the deferred revenue acquired from surfcontrol in october from to revenue from dlp products initially acquired from portauthority contributed million for compared to million for the number of seats under subscription increased from million as of december  to million as of december  revenue from products sold in the united states accounted for million or of revenue compared to million or in revenue from products sold internationally accounted for million or of revenue compared to million or in we had current deferred revenue of million as of december   compared to million as of december  we expect our revenue to increase over revenue levels due to the level of current deferred revenue that will be recognized as revenue during  subscriptions that are scheduled for renewal in that are expected to be renewed and expected new business during for which some revenue will be recognized during our revenue in may be impacted by the duration of contracts for renewal and new subscriptions  the timing of sales of renewal and new subscriptions  the average annual contract value and per seat price  and currency exchange rates impacting new and renewal subscriptions in international markets 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of the costs of content review  technical support  infrastructure costs associated with maintaining our databases  costs associated with providing our hosted security services and amortization of acquired technology 
cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the million increase primarily consisted of million of increased amortization of acquired technology primarily due to the acquisition of surfcontrol in october  million related to increased personnel costs in our technical support and database groups  including the increased headcount attributable to the acquisition of surfcontrol  million related to the hosted services operations we acquired from surfcontrol and million related to increased allocated costs

as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to during from in we expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars in but as a percentage of revenue will remain approximately the same for compared to gross margin gross margin increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased to in from in primarily due to the increased costs described in the preceding cost of revenue section 
we expect that gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  will remain in excess of of revenue for operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits related to personnel engaged in selling  marketing and customer support functions  including costs 
table of contents related to public relations  advertising  promotions and travel  amortization of acquired customer relationships as well as allocated costs 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in approximately million of the increase was due to the amortization of acquired customer relationships which resulted from the acquisition of surfcontrol in october as of december   the acquired customer relationships intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
in addition to the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the increase in selling and marketing expenses was due to increased personnel costs of million  including new personnel added to support increased sales following the surfcontrol acquisition in october  and million of increased allocated costs 
our headcount in sales and marketing increased from an average of during to an average of during operating expenses in were reduced by improvements in us currency exchange rates relative to the foreign currencies in which certain of our international expenses were incurred 
we expect overall selling and marketing expenses to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in primarily due to a decrease of approximately million of amortization of acquired intangibles from the surfcontrol acquisition and an elimination of the non recurring acquisition related expenses 
we expect amortization of acquired intangibles of million in based on our existing acquired intangible assets as of december  from the surfcontrol and portauthority acquisitions 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers and allocated costs 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily due to million of increased personnel cost  including adding new employees due to the surfcontrol acquisition in october  and increased hiring to support our release of our web content gateway  dlp endpoint module and enhancements to our other products as well as to support our expanding list of technology partners and million of increased allocated costs 
our headcount increased in research and development from an average of during to an average of during included in research and development for was million of in process research and development related to our portauthority acquisition in january we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in due to our expanded base of product offerings and the hiring of personnel to support our continued enhancements of our existing and new products 
we are managing the increase in our absolute research and development expenses by operating research and development facilities in multiple international locations  including a facility in beijing  china  that have lower costs than our operations in the united states 
as a result of the portauthority and surfcontrol acquisitions  we now have research and development facilities in ra anana  israel  los gatos  california and reading  england  that have contributed to our increased research and development expenses 
while we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in  we expect that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will decrease in compared to due to the expected increase in revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for our executive  finance  and administrative personnel  third party professional services fees and allocated costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to million of increased personnel costs needed to support our growing operations  including the acquisition of surfcontrol in october  million of increased professional services primarily related to surfcontrol integration activities and million of increased allocated costs 
our headcount increased in general and administrative departments from an average of during to an average of during during  we incurred million in non recurring acquisition related general and administrative expenses  including professional services  integration travel and allocated excess facility expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of revenue in due to the expected increase in revenue 

table of contents interest expense interest expense represents the interest incurred on our senior secured credit facility that we utilized to pay for a portion of the surfcontrol purchase price in october interest expense increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the senior secured credit facility being outstanding for only one quarter in compared to the full year in also included in the interest expense is amortization of deferred financing fees of million and  for and  respectively that were capitalized as part of the senior secured credit facility 
we made prepayments on the senior secured credit facility that reduced the outstanding balance from million as of december  to million as of december  as a result of reductions in the libor interest rate and improvements in our leverage ratio  our weighted average interest rate decreased from at december  to as of december  the amount of interest expense will fluctuate due to changes in the outstanding principal balance  changes in libor and changes in our applicable spread to libor based upon improvements in our leverage ratio in accordance with our senior secured credit facility agreement 
interest expense should decline in compared to due to the lower average outstanding principal amount under the senior secured credit facility and the expected lower marginal interest rate on the non fixed rate component of our senior secured credit facility due to the reduction in our spread over libor 
fluctuations in libor could impact our marginal interest rate 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of our senior secured credit facility 
other income  net net other income decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to reduced cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances from which we generate interest income as a result of our use of an aggregate of million to fund the acquisitions of surfcontrol in october and portauthority in january and related transaction costs 
during  we also used million to make prepayments of principal on our senior secured credit facility and approximately million for stock repurchases reducing our cash balances 
the decline in net other income was also due to lower interest rates realized on our balances of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as foreign exchange losses due to unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates during as compared with we expect to continue to generate significant cash flow from our operations and expect to continue to use a substantial portion of cash generated to pay down debt and fund stock repurchases 
due to a lower interest rate environment we expect our net other income in will be less than levels 
provision for income taxes in  we recognized an income tax benefit of million compared to an income tax expense of million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate variance from the statutory rate was primarily related to losses generated in a low tax jurisdiction ireland and the establishment of a valuation allowance related to net operating losses for one of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom 
in the annual effective tax rate variance from the statutory rate was primarily attributed to certain post acquisition net operating losses related to surfcontrol s us operations for which no tax benefit was recorded due to the uncertainty of the future utilization of these losses 
our effective tax rate may change in future periods due to the composition of taxable income between domestic and international operations  the magnitude of our tax exempt income  any future acquisitions and any future changes or interpretations in tax rules and legislation  or corresponding accounting rules 

table of contents year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenue revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of the addition of new  renewed and upgraded subscriptions from our customers that resulted in a million increase in the number of seats under subscription excluding the addition of approximately million surfcontrol seats from december  to december  our revenue also increased compared to as a result of the acquisitions of portauthority in january and surfcontrol in october cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to million of amortization of acquired technology which resulted from the acquisitions of surfcontrol in october and portauthority in january  as well as increased costs for additional personnel in our technical support and database groups  including the increase in headcount attributable to the acquisition of surfcontrol and the addition of dlp products  and allocated costs

selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in approximately million of the increase was due to the amortization of acquired intangibles primarily customer relationships which resulted from the acquisitions of surfcontrol in october and portauthority in january as of december   the acquired customer relationships intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
in addition to the amortization of acquired intangibles  the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to additional expenses associated with our new channel strategy started in  increased personnel costs and related travel  including new personnel added from the portauthority and surfcontrol acquisitions and allocated costs 
our headcount in sales and marketing increased from employees at december  to employees at december  research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased personnel cost  including costs of adding new full time employees due to the portauthority and surfcontrol acquisitions  and increased hiring to support our expanding list of technology partners  the enhancements of websense enterprise  the development of websense express and enhancements to additional products  and allocated costs

table of contents interest expense interest expense represents the interest incurred on our senior secured credit facility that we utilized to pay for a portion of the surfcontrol purchase price in october also included in the interest expense is  of amortization of deferred financing fees that were capitalized as part of the senior secured credit facility 
other income  net net other income decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to reduced cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances from which we generate interest income as a result of our use of an aggregate of million to fund the acquisitions of surfcontrol in october and portauthority in january and related transaction costs 
this decline in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was partially offset by higher interest rates realized on our balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during as compared with provision for income taxes in  we recognized an income tax expense of million as compared to million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the decrease in the tax rate was primarily the result of the following factors 
related to the acquisition of surfcontrol  we recorded certain post acquisition net operating losses related to surfcontrol s us operations for which no tax benefit is currently recorded due to the uncertainty of future utilization of these losses 
related to the acquisition of portauthority  we expensed acquired in process research and development in our loss before income taxes for which a tax deduction is not allowed 
in addition  although the share based compensation for which no tax benefit is recorded in and our state income tax provision are both comparable to prior year s amounts  the impact of these items on the effective tax rate percentage is greater due to the relative size of the pre tax loss of million in compared to the pre tax income of million in recent accounting pronouncements in march the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities  the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas and its related interpretations  and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on the company s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas is effective for us beginning january  we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas may have on our financial statements 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in after january  will be recorded and disclosed following sfas r 
we expect sfas r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we may consummate after the effective date 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and retained earnings of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  investments in marketable 
table of contents securities of million and retained earnings of million 
during  we used million of our cash to pay down principal on our senior secured term loan and to repurchase approximately million of our common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily a result of our cash collections increasing by approximately million due principally from increased sales resulting from the surfcontrol acquisition and sales of new products  partially off set by increased cash expenses of approximately million principally associated with increased cash operating expenses after the surfcontrol acquisition and interest payments associated with the senior secured credit facility utilized to finance the surfcontrol acquisition 
our operating cash flow is significantly influenced by sales of new and renewal subscriptions  accounts receivable collections and cash operating expenses 
a decrease in sales of subscriptions or accounts receivable collections will negatively impact our operating cash flow 
we expect to continue to generate significant cash flow from operations in net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared with net cash used in investing activities of million in the million change in net cash provided by investing activities for was primarily due to the net cash paid for the acquisitions of portauthority and surfcontrol totaling approximately million in and offset by the increase of net maturities over purchases of marketable securities of approximately million in compared to net cash used in financing activities was million in compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million in the million change in net cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to borrowing million on our senior secured term loan in and making debt related payments of approximately million million on the senior secured credit facility related to surfcontrol and million related to portauthority in compared to million of debt related payments on the senior secured term loan in we also repurchased approximately million of our common stock in compared to making no stock repurchases in in connection with the acquisition of surfcontrol in october  we entered into an amended and restated senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement 
the million senior secured credit facility consists of a five year million senior secured term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the senior secured term loan was fully funded on october   and the revolving line of credit remains unused 
through december   we have made prepayments totaling million on our senior secured term loan  reducing the outstanding balance to million 
the senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including pledges of stock of some of our subsidiaries subject to limitations in the case of foreign subsidiaries and by secured guarantees by our domestic subsidiaries 
the senior secured term loan initially amortized at a minimum rate of    and  respectively  during the first four years of the term and during the fifth year 
in conjunction with our million prepayment on december   we amended our senior credit agreement to eliminate any additional mandatory principal payments until september  the senior secured term loan bears interest at a spread above libor with the spread determined based upon our total leverage ratio  as defined in the senior credit agreement 
the initial interest rate on the credit facility was libor plus basis points  and was subject to step downs in the spread over libor based upon potential future improvements in our total leverage ratio 
the unused portion of the revolving credit facility required a basis points fee per annum  also subject to a step down based upon potential future improvements in our total leverage ratio 
as of july  the spread on both the senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility was reset to libor plus basis points per annum for the senior secured term loan and reduced by basis points per annum for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate on the senior secured term loan at december  was 
the senior credit agreement contains financial covenants  including a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio  as well as affirmative and negative covenants 
among the negative covenants are restrictions on our ability to borrow money  including restrictions on a the incurrence of more than million of new debt  including capital leases subject to certain exceptions  b the incurrence of more than million in letters of

the senior credit agreement provides that we must maintain hedge agreements so that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured credit facility is subject to fixed interest rate protection for a period of not less than years from the initial funding date 
on october  in conjunction with the funding of the senior secured credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of interest per annum and receive a floating rate interest payment based on three month libor on an equivalent amount 
the initial notional amount of the swap agreement was million on october  and it amortizes each quarter down to million on june  in addition  on october  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement to limit the maximum interest rate on a portion of our senior secured term loan to per annum 
the amount of principal protected by this agreement increases from million at december  to million on june  both the interest rate swap and cap expire on september  obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payment obligations by year thereafter total senior secured term loan schedule principal payments estimated interest and fees operating leases facility exit obligation software licenses total obligations under our senior credit agreement represent the future minimum principal debt payments due under the senior secured term loan 
estimated interest and fees expected to be incurred on the senior secured term loan are based on known rates and scheduled principal payments as of december  see note to the audited financial statements 
we lease our facilities under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through approximately one half of our operating lease commitments are related to our corporate headquarters lease  which extends through december our corporate headquarters lease includes escalating rent payments from to the rent expense related to our worldwide office space leases are recorded monthly on a straight line basis in accordance with gaap 
facility exit obligation represents estimated future lease costs from a facility acquired from surfcontrol that is being exited as more fully described in note to the audited financial statements 
these costs will be paid over the respective lease term through these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
software license obligations represent purchase commitments for software licenses made in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits as more fully described in note to the audited financial statements have been excluded from the contractual payment obligations table above 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
share repurchase program

in  we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
in  we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices 
in january  we adopted a b plan that provides for quarterly purchases of our common stock in open market transactions 
depending on market conditions and other factors  purchases by our agent under this program may be commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice to us 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of approximately million at an average price of per share 
as of december   we had cumulatively repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
under the terms of the senior credit agreement  we are restricted from repurchasing our common stock for an aggregate purchase price that exceeds the sum of million plus of the aggregate amount of our consolidated net income  as defined in our senior credit agreement  during the period from the effective date of the facility through the most recent quarter end for which we have filed quarterly financial statements 
as of december   we can repurchase up to million of our common stock under our senior credit agreement  excluding shares we had repurchased through december  we intend to purchase shares during the remainder of prospective capital needs 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances  revolving credit balances and our ongoing cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  including our capital expenditures  debt repayment obligations and stock repurchases  if any  for at least the next months 
during  we made voluntary prepayments on our senior secured term loan of million and repurchased million of our common stock 
our cash requirements may increase for reasons we do not currently foresee or we may make acquisitions as part of our growth strategy that increase our cash requirements 
we may elect to raise funds for these purposes through capital markets transactions or debt or private equity transactions as appropriate 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating and capital requirements in interest bearing  investment grade securities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and senior secured term loan 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments such as money market funds 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and the interest expense incurred on our senior secured term loan and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our money market funds and from our borrowings under our variable rate senior secured term loan used in connection with the acquisition of surfcontrol in october our senior credit agreement provides that we must maintain hedge agreements so that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured term loan is subject to fixed interest rate protection for a period of not less than years from the date of the initial funding of the loan 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would materially affect our interest expense 
however  the impact of this type of adverse movement would be partially mitigated by our interest rate swap and cap agreements 
based on our outstanding senior secured term loan balance at december  and taking into consideration our interest rate swap and cap  our interest expense would increase by approximately  during if there were a basis point adverse move in the interest rate yield curve 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive investments at december  changes in interest rates over time will  however  affect our interest income 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and zero cost collar contracts to hedge foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets  liabilities and expenses 
we bill certain international customers in euros  british pounds  australian dollars  chinese yuan renminbi and japanese yen 
we also keep working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries in the local currencies in which they do business 
as exchange rate fluctuations can significantly vary our sales and expense results when converted to us dollars  our objective is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we began hedging our israeli shekel denominated operating expenses during due to our increase in israeli shekel operating expenses and increased volatility of the israeli shekel

we do not expect euro billings to represent more than of our total billings during the approximate million notional increase in our british pound hedged position at december  compared to december  is primarily the result of increased british pound denominated accounts receivable in and a reduction in british pound denominated acquisition related obligations in all of the british pound hedging contracts in place as of december  will be settled before february  for and  less than of our total billings were denominated in the british pound 
we do not expect british pound billings to represent more than of our total billings during given our foreign exchange position  a change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures
