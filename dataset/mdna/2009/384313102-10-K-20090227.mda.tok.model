we corrected this error in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in an overstatement of fourth quarter income tax expense of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the gain from the sale of our former cathodes business reported in discontinued operations should have been million higher million net of tax than the actual reported gain  as the amount was incorrectly recorded to the cumulative translation adjustment account in equity in this error was corrected in the fourth quarter of this resulted in an understatement of net income of million in the fourth quarter of and a corresponding overstatement of net income in the fourth quarter of we have determined that the impact of these items was not material to any of the quarterly or annual periods affected 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we have four major product categories graphite electrodes  refractory products  advanced graphite materials  and natural graphite products 
reportable segments 
our businesses are reported in the following categories industrial materials  which consists of graphite electrodes and refractory products 
engineered solutions  which includes advanced graphite materials and natural graphite products 
reference is made to the information under part i for background information on our businesses  industry and related matters 
global economic conditions and outlook we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or country conditions fluctuate 
our discussions about market data and global economic conditions below are based on or derived from published industry accounts and statistics 
and overall  global and regional economic conditions remained relatively stable in and we estimate that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in and billion metric tons in  about a and increase  respectively  over the prior year 
in  china s production grew almost and represented the single largest contributor to the growth in global steel demand 
chinese steel production was approximately basic oxygen furnace related for however  china also was the growth leader for new eaf steel production 
overall  eaf steel production capacity grew  primarily driven by new eaf furnaces in china  and to a lesser extent  in russia  the middle east and north america 
in  china s production grew almost and represented the single largest contributor to the growth in global steel demand 
chinese steel production was basic oxygen furnace related in china remained the growth leader for new eaf steel production 
overall  eaf steel production capacity continued to grow in  primarily driven by new eaf furnaces in china  and to a lesser extent  in russia  the middle east and north america 
this contributed to a more favorable global pricing environment in demand for our engineered solutions products increased significantly in and  as compared to prior years 
the increases were mainly in the energy related markets  including solar  oil and gas exploration  transportation industries and markets for our natural graphite products 
global and regional economic conditions remained relatively stable in the first half of in september it became apparent that the global economy was entering into difficult times due to the financial industry crisis 
credit markets became frozen  liquidity diminished  business activity slowed at an extreme pace leading the global economy into its worst crisis in years 
due to the negative global economic situation and falling steel demand from key steel end markets automotive  construction  and appliances  a significant number of global steel producers reduced their operating rates in the fourth quarter 
based on preliminary figures  worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  about a decrease as compared to china s steel production grew at a much lower rate than in recent years due to a slowdown in economic growth and falling steel demand 
in  china s steel production grew by about  a significant decline compared to china s recent double digit annual growth rates 
steel production in the rest of the world declined by in the percent of eaf to total steel production remained at approximately in eaf steel production was estimated to have been million metric tons in  about a decrease compared to for the first nine months of the year  eaf production grew by over  however  eaf production experienced a decline of in the fourth quarter 
china s eaf steel production increased compared to the prior year 
the rest of the world s eaf production declined by  as a result of lower operating rates in the fourth quarter 

table of contents demand for our engineered solutions segment increased in as compared to the increases were mainly in the energy related markets  including solar  oil and gas exploration  transportation industries  and etm markets 
outlook 
consensus among economists is that the global economic crisis is deepening  with slowdowns in major advanced economies now spreading into major emerging markets 
a decline in growth rates is expected for advanced economies such as the united states and europe 
while in emerging countries such as china  india  and brazil  economists expect very low growth compared with recent historical trends 
the challenging environment of the fourth quarter for our industrial materials business segment continues and we expect a similar scenario for at least the first half of it is expected due to the financial crisis and global economic slowdown that much of the new eaf capacity projected to be started or completed in the timeframe will be postponed 
longer term  it is expected that eaf will continue to grow as a percent of total steel driven primarily by new eaf furnaces in china  russia  the middle east and north america 
because our engineered solutions business crosses many markets  the negative global economy will impact each market in varying degrees 
however  we believe our engineered solutions products will be faced with reduced demand in economic conditions and the market environment continue to be extremely volatile and uncertain 
as a result  we are not able to predict at this time an outlook for the full year however  we do expect capital expenditures to be approximately million depreciation expense to be approximately million our outlook could be significantly impacted by  among other things  factors described under item a risk factors and item a forward looking statements in this report 
financing transactions on february   we completed a substantial amendment and restatement of the credit agreement to effect a refinancing of the revolving facility 
we believe the refinancing enhanced liquidity 
the revolving facility now provides for loans and letters of credit in a maximum amount outstanding at any time of up to million and matures in july we have approximately million of working capital liquidity available to use through our factoring and supply chain arrangements currently in place 
during  we redeemed million of the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes due  at of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
during  we also converted to equity the million principal amount of our convertible senior debentures for  shares of our common stock and million in cash  million of which represented the present value of all remaining scheduled interest payments from the date of conversion until january  during  we entered into a supply chain financing arrangement  as discussed in more detail under liquidity and capital resources  below 
during  we purchased approximately million of inventory under this arrangement 
during  we sold million of receivables at a cost lower than the cost to borrow a comparable amount for a comparable period under the revolving facility 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 
proceedings against us we are involved in various other investigations  lawsuits  claims  demands  environmental compliance programs  and other legal proceedings arising out of or incidental to the conduct of our business 
while it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these matters and proceedings  we do not believe that their ultimate disposition will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents realizability of net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december  we had million of gross deferred income tax assets  of which million required a valuation allowance 
in addition  we had million of gross deferred income tax liabilities 
our valuation allowance means that we do not believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized 
until we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets  income tax benefits in each current period will be fully reserved 
our valuation allowance does not affect our ability and intent to utilize the deferred income tax assets as we generate sufficient future profitability 
we are executing current strategies and developing future strategies  to improve sales  reduce costs and improve our capital structure in order to improve us taxable income of the appropriate character to a level sufficient to fully realize these benefits in future years 
the current us tax attributes  if utilized  will allow us to significantly reduce our cash tax obligations in the us customer base we are a global company and serve all major geographic markets 
sales of our products to customers outside the us accounted for about of our net sales in  of our net sales in  and of our net sales in in  seven of our ten largest customers were based in europe  one in india  one in south america and one in the middle east 
in  our ten largest customers were purchasers of industrial materials products 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than of our net sales in results of operations financial information discussed below excludes our cathodes business that was sold in december and has been accounted for as discontinued operations 
compared to consolidated 
net sales of  million in represented a million or increase from net sales of million in net sales for our industrial materials segment increased million  or  primarily due to favorable price mix increases and favorable currency impacts in compared to engineered solutions net sales increased million  or  due to price mix increases and favorable currency impacts in compared to cost of sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in cost of sales increased due to higher sales volumes  higher raw material and operating costs  and unfavorable currency impacts 
these increases were offset by a decrease due to reduced period costs associated with the exit of the carbon electrode business and productivity savings realized from the sale of our vyazma  russia facility 
gross profit of million in represented an million  or  increase from gross profit of million in gross margin increased to of net sales in from of net sales in research and development expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in  with the decrease primarily due to salary reductions related to administration and support for our research and development function 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was due to a million decrease in selling expenses  a million decrease in administrative expenses  and a million decrease in other overhead 
these decreases in selling expenses were caused by decreased traveling and discretionary expenses as a result of our global cost cutting initiative 
administrative expenses and other overhead also decreased due to this initiative and also due to cost savings realized by insourcing our accounting function in parma  ohio 
beginning in  the united states department of justice doj and certain foreign antitrust authorities commenced investigations into alleged violations of the antitrust laws in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
these antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims have been resolved 
several of the investigations resulted in the 
table of contents imposition of fines against us which have been timely paid 
in january  we paid the last scheduled installment of the fine imposed by the doj 
other income was million in compared to million in this increase was caused primarily by an increase in the gain on sale of assets 
the gain on sale of assets increased by million in  caused primarily by the gain on the sale of our caserta  italy facility of million and the million gain from the sale of our vyazma  russia facility 
this was offset by a million charge incurred in related to the buy back of our senior notes

effects of inflation we incur costs in the us and each of the six us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by the effects of inflation on our costs incurred in each of these countries 
see currency translation and transactions for a further discussion of highly inflationary countries 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  natural gas derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas cost exposure 
currency translation and transactions we translate the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders equity and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 

table of contents we account for our russian and mexican subsidiaries using the dollar as the functional currency  as sales and purchases are predominantly dollar denominated 
our remaining subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses  including those from non permanent intercompany loans  as part of other income expense  net 
significant changes in currency exchange rates impacting us are described under effects of changes in currency exchange rates and results of operations 
effects of changes in currency exchange rates when the currencies of non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the us dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the us dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
in certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities  and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets  we sell in currencies other than the dollar 
accordingly  when these currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
many of the non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic changes  which have significantly impacted currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales  cost of sales or net income

at december  and  the aggregate principal amount of these loans was million and million  respectively 
these loans are subject to remeasurement gains and losses due to changes in currency exchange rates 
certain of these loans had been deemed to be essentially permanent prior to settlement and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the remaining loans are deemed to be temporary and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as currency gains losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations

the cost and availability of funding has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets 
we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet all of our present needs 
continued turbulence in the united states and international financial markets  however  could adversely affect the cost and availability of financing to us in the future 
our sources of funds have consisted principally of cash flow from operations and debt and equity financings 
our uses of those funds other than for operations have consisted principally of capital expenditures  our equity investment in a non consolidated affiliate  payment of restructuring costs  pension and post retirement contributions  debt reduction payments and other obligations 
as of december   we have several future obligations accrued that will utilize a material amount of such funds 
these obligations include our employee incentive compensation payout of approximately million  which will be paid during the second quarter of a portion of this payout may be made in common stock 
we also plan to contribute million to our pension plans during at december   we had total long term debt of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and a stockholders equity of million 
as part of our cash management activities  we manage accounts receivable credit risk  collections  and accounts payable vendor terms to maximize our free cash at any given time and minimize accounts receivable losses 
during and  certain subsidiaries sold receivables totaling million and million  respectively  at a cost lower than the cost to borrow a comparable amount for a comparable period under the revolving facility 
proceeds of the sale of receivables were used to reduce debt and fund operations 
if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable would have been about million higher at december  and million higher at december  all such receivables sold during and were sold without recourse  and no amount of accounts receivable sold remained on the consolidated balance sheet at december  lower sales volumes for our products and reduced credit quality of our customers may limit the amount of receivables that we sell in the future 
we expect a negative cash impact of approximately million as we sell fewer receivables during the first half of our current receivable sales facility automatically renews for one year periods on june  and each year thereafter unless a termination notice is sent by either party days prior to this date 
during  we entered into a supply chain financing arrangement with a financing party 
under this arrangement  we essentially assigned our rights to purchase needle coke from our supplier to the financing party 
the financing party purchases the product from our supplier under the standard payment terms and then immediately resells it to us under longer payment terms 
the financing party pays the supplier the purchase price for the product and then we pay the financing party 
our payment for this needle coke will include a mark up the mark up 
the mark up is subject to quarterly reviews 
in effect  we have a longer period of time to pay the financing party than by purchasing directly from the supplier which helps us maintain a balanced cash conversion cycle between inventory payments and the collection of receivables 
at december   we have purchased approximately million of inventory under this arrangement 
in connection with these purchases  we have incurred a mark up of approximately million 
in the future  particularly in the first half of  we may not be able to utilize this financing arrangement to the full extent allowed under the agreement as lower demand for our products may diminish our need for needle coke 
we expect a negative cash impact of approximately million in the first half of related to the lower utilization of this facility 
this agreement is subject to termination days after notice is sent by either party 
for  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  of which approximately million relates to carryover costs from projects that commenced in prior years 
the balance of our planned capital expenditures relates primarily to maintenance and repair of production equipment 
due to the global economic conditions  we have reduced our planned capital expenditures to lower levels than in prior years 

table of contents in the event that operating cash flow  the sales of receivables and the financing of needle coke purchases fail to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our business needs  including capital expenditures  any such shortfall would be made up by increased borrowings under our revolving facility 
we use cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  funds from receivable and payable factoring arrangements and funds available under the revolving facility subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants and representations under the revolving facility as well as cash on hand as our primary sources of liquidity 
the revolving facility is secured  and provides for maximum borrowings of up to million and  subject to certain conditions including a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test  an accordion feature that permits graftech finance to establish additional credit facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount  together with the revolving facility  of up to million 
the revolving facility matures in july eleven banks are participants in our credit facility 
all of these eleven banks currently have s p ratings of a or better 
based on these ratings  we do not foresee a significant risk that our availability under this facility may be reduced in the future 
at december   million was drawn from the facility  and million was available after consideration of outstanding revolving and swingline loans of million and letters of credit of million 
it is possible that our future ability to borrow under the revolving facility may effectively be less because of the impact of additional borrowings upon our compliance with the maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratio permitted or minimum interest coverage ratio required under the revolving facility 
we also have approximately million of working capital liquidity available to us through our factoring and supply chain financing arrangements currently in place 
as of december   we had a corporate s p rating of bb and a moody s rating of ba based on our current business plan  we do not believe that it is likely that this credit rating will be downgraded during however  continued deterioration of the current economic environment  the termination of our accounts receivable factoring program or the termination of our supply chain financing agreement may result in higher borrowings on our revolving facility  which could negatively impact our rating 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants contained in the senior notes and the revolving facility  as applicable 
these covenants include maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least and a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of based on a rolling average of the prior four quarters 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with these covenants over the next twelve months 
if we were to believe that we would not continue to comply with these covenants  we would seek an appropriate waiver or amendment from the lenders thereunder 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all 
at december   approximately of our debt consists of fixed rate obligations 
at december   the revolving facility had an effective interest rate of and our million principal amount of senior notes had a fixed rate of

the following tables summarize our long term contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december  payment due by period total year ending december two years ending december two years ending december years ending after december dollars in thousands contractual and other obligations long term debt operating leases purchase obligations a total contractual obligations postretirement  pension and related benefits b interest c other long term obligations uncertain income tax provisions total contractual and other obligations a b c other commercial commitments lines of credit d letters of credit guarantees total other commercial commitments a effective april  we entered into a ten year service contract with cgi group inc cgi valued at that time at million million at december  pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our global information services 
under the outsourcing provisions of this contract  cgi managed our data center services  networks  desktops laptops and legacy systems 
this contract was amended to reduce the scope of cgi s management of our data center services  networks  desktops and telecommunications 
we are dependent on cgi for these services 
a failure by cgi to provide any of these services to us in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
b represents estimated postretirement  pension and related benefits obligations based on actuarial calculations 
c excludes the accounting for deferred financing costs or gains on the sale of hedge instruments 
payments assume senior notes  with a fixed rate of interest of  mature on february  d local lines of credit are established by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes and are not part of the revolving facility 
the total amount available under these lines of credit amounted to million at december  cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
our business strategies include efforts to enhance our capital structure by further reducing our gross obligations 
further  we have placed a high priority on accelerating the amount and speed of cash generated every day 
our efforts include leveraging our global manufacturing network by driving higher utilization rates and more productivity from our existing assets  accelerating commercialization initiatives across all of our businesses and realizing other global efficiencies 
in addition  we may continue to exchange or repurchase senior notes as described below 

table of contents typically  our cash flow from operations fluctuates significantly between quarters due to various factors 
these factors include customer order patterns  fluctuations in working capital requirements  and other factors 
in  and  we had positive cash flow from operations primarily from improved operating results 
we expect cash flow from operations to be positively impacted by reduced cash interest payments of about million related to our reduced senior note and debenture obligations  lower inventory and accounts receivable balances  and decreases in cash outlays for restructuring activities 
we expect our cash flow from operations to be negatively impacted by lower sales  increased interest expense related to higher revolving facility draws  higher raw material prices  the payment of certain international deferred taxes  and planned pension and post retirement contributions 
our debt and other obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity 
cash flow from operations services payment of our debt and other obligations  including our incentive compensation program payout in the second quarter of  thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 
although our current debt level is at a low level  continued or further downturns in the global economy may require increased borrowings under our revolving facility  particularly if our accounts receivable and supply chain financing arrangements are terminated 
such downturns could significantly negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows  which  coupled with increased borrowings  could negatively impact our credit ratings  our ability to comply with debt covenants  our ability to secure additional financing and the cost of such financing  if available 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with financial covenants in in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we reduced our sales of  or refused to sell except for cash on delivery  our products to some customers and potential customers 
in the current economic environment  our customers may experience liquidity shortages or difficulties in obtaining credit  including letters of credit 
our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide have not been material during the last years individually or in the aggregate 
we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
in addition  we have historically factored a portion of our accounts receivable and used the proceeds to reduce debt 
our ability to factor accounts receivable in the future may be limited by lower receivables balances as a result of decreased sales or by reduced credit ratings of customers 
we may continue from time to time and at any time to redeem or to repurchase senior notes in open market or privately negotiated transactions  opportunistically on terms that we believe to be favorable 
during  we redeemed a total of million of our senior notes 
these purchases were  and any future purchases may be  effected for cash from cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under the revolving facility or new credit facilities  or proceeds from sale of debt or equity securities or assets  in exchange for common stock or other equity or debt securities  or a combination thereof 
we will evaluate any such transaction in light of then prevailing market conditions and our then current and prospective liquidity and capital resources  including projected and potential needs and prospects for access to capital markets 
any such transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  be material 
in december  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
share repurchases may take place from time to time in the open market  or through privately negotiated transactions  as market conditions warrant 
we intend to fund any such share repurchases from available cash and cash flows 
these share repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
related party transactions 
since january   we have not engaged in or been a party to any material transactions with affiliates or related parties other than transactions with our current or former subsidiaries including carbone savoie and aet and compensatory transactions with directors and officers including

costs relating to protection of the environment we have been and are subject to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition  we have an on going commitment to rigorous internal environmental protection standards 
environmental considerations are part of all significant capital expenditure decisions 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding environmental expenses and capital expenditures 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands expenses relating to environmental protection capital expenditures related to environmental protection critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical 
reliance on estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use and rely on estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges and contingencies  tax valuation allowances  evaluation of goodwill  our investment in a non consolidated affiliate and other intangible assets  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and various other recorded or disclosed amounts  including inventory valuations 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
employee benefit plans 
we sponsor various retirement and pension plans  including defined benefit and defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans that cover most employees worldwide 
excluding the defined contribution plans  accounting for these plans requires assumptions as to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  expected salary increases and health care cost trend rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies by recording an estimated loss when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as those relating to environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss is significantly different from the estimated loss  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as incurred 
impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of the future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated fair value  our assets may be overstated 
future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over our current technology  significant negative economic or industry trends  changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets  and future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to make the following assessments estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction  estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that we include within the consolidated balance sheets  and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable 
table of contents income and  if we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
if our estimates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets or liabilities may be overstated or understated 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue from sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  title has passed  the amount is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
product warranty claims and returns are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue 
volume discounts and rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue in conjunction with the sale of the related products 
changes to estimates are recorded when they become probable 
shipping and handling revenues relating to products sold are included as an increase to revenue 
shipping and handling costs related to products sold are included as an increase to cost of sales 
stock based compensation plans 
we account for stock based compensation under sfas no 
r 
accordingly  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair market value of the award and recognized over the requisite service period 
the fair value of restricted stock is based on the trading price of our common stock on the date of grant  less required adjustments to reflect dividends paid and expected forfeitures or cancellations of awards throughout the vesting period  which ranges between one and three years 
our stock option compensation expense calculated under the fair value method  using a black scholes model  is recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period

description of our financing structure the information required by this item with respect to our financing structure is set forth under long term debt and liquidity in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report  and is incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commercial energy rates 
we  from time to time  routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage these well defined risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described below 
since the counterparties  if any  to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk  despite the current worldwide economic situation 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from floating rate long term debt tied to libor or euro libor 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  and investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  to the extent denominated in currencies other than the dollar 
our exposure to changes in energy costs results primarily from the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations 
interest rate risk management 
we periodically implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to 
table of contents minimize our interest expense and the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
when we sell a fair value swap  the gain or loss is amortized as a credit or charge to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
when we effectively reduce the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes through debt for equity exchanges  repurchases or otherwise  the related portion of such credit or charge is accelerated and recorded in the period in which such reduction occurs 
we periodically enter into agreements with financial institutions that are intended to limit  or cap  our exposure to incurrence of additional interest expense due to increases in variable interest rates 
these instruments effectively cap our interest rate exposure 
currency rate management 
we enter into foreign currency instruments from time to time to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
these foreign currency instruments  which include  but are not limited to  forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options  attempt to hedge global currency exposures  net  relating to non dollar denominated debt and identifiable foreign currency receivables  payables and commitments held by our foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate 
purchased foreign currency options are instruments  which give the holder the right  but not the obligation  to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates 
the result is the creation of a range in which a best and worst price is defined  while minimizing option cost 
forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value 
we did not enter into any such contracts during during  we entered into one such contract  which at december  represented an unrealized gain of million 
commercial energy rate management 
we periodically enter into natural gas derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas cost exposure 
the outstanding contracts at december  represented an unrealized loss of million 
the outstanding contracts at december  represented an unrealized loss of million 
sensitivity analysis 
we used a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential effect of changes in currency exchange rates on gross margin and changes in interest rates on interest expense 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the dollar across all other currencies would have changed our reported gross margin for by about million 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased our interest expense by million for the year ended december
