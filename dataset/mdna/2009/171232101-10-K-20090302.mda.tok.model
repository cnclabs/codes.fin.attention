table of contents critical accounting estimates and judgments the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management for transactions that are not yet complete 
such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
those estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the determination of loss reserves and the recoverability of related reinsurance recoverables and the evaluation of whether a decline in value of any investment is temporary or other than temporary 
these estimates and judgments  which are discussed within the following analysis of our results of operations  require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and therefore are subject to change as facts and circumstances develop 
if different estimates and judgments had been applied  materially different amounts might have been reported in the financial statements 
overview the following highlights do not address all of the matters covered in the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or contain all of the information that may be important to chubb s shareholders or the investing public 
this overview should be read in conjunction with the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net income was billion in compared with billion in and billion in the lower net income in was due primarily to two factors 
first  underwriting income in our property and casualty insurance business was substantially lower in than in and second  we had realized investment losses in compared with realized investment gains in and underwriting results were highly profitable in  and  but more so in and our combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in the less profitable results in were due in large part to higher catastrophe losses and the cumulative impact of rate reductions experienced in our commercial and professional liability classes over the past several years 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in during  we experienced overall favorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end  due primarily to favorable loss experience in certain professional liability and commercial liability classes as well as lower than expected emergence of losses in the homeowners and commercial property classes 
during  we experienced overall favorable development of million due primarily to favorable loss trends in the professional liability classes  lower than expected emergence of losses in the homeowners and commercial property classes and better than expected reported loss activity in the run off of our reinsurance assumed business 
during  we experienced overall favorable development of million due primarily to lower than expected emergence of losses in the homeowners and commercial property classes 
total net premiums written decreased by in both and the lack of growth in both years reflected our continued emphasis on underwriting discipline in a highly competitive market environment 
net premiums written in the united states decreased by in and in net premiums written outside the united states increased by in and in  such growth was largely attributable to the impact of currency fluctuation 
property and casualty investment income after tax increased by in and in the growth in was limited as average invested assets increased only modestly during the year

table of contents net realized investment losses before taxes were million in compared with net realized gains before taxes of million in and million in the net realized losses in were primarily attributable to other than temporary impairment losses on equity securities 
the net realized gains in and were primarily attributable to gains from investments in limited partnerships 
a summary of our consolidated net income is as follows years ended december in millions property and casualty insurance corporate and other realized investment gains losses consolidated income before income tax federal and foreign income tax consolidated net income property and casualty insurance a summary of the results of operations of our property and casualty insurance business is as follows years ended december in millions underwriting net premiums written decrease increase in unearned premiums premiums earned losses and loss expenses operating costs and expenses increase in deferred policy acquisition costs dividends to policyholders underwriting income investments investment income before expenses investment expenses investment income other income property and casualty income before tax property and casualty investment income after tax property and casualty income before tax in was lower than in due to substantially lower underwriting income 
the decrease in underwriting income in was due in large part to higher catastrophe losses and the cumulative impact of rate reductions experienced over the past several years in our commercial and specialty insurance businesses 
property and casualty income before tax in was higher than in due to higher underwriting income  particularly in our specialty insurance business  as well as a substantial increase in investment income due to an increase in invested assets 

table of contents the profitability of our property and casualty insurance business depends on the results of both our underwriting and investment operations 
we view these as two distinct operations since the underwriting functions are managed separately from the investment function 
accordingly  in assessing our performance  we evaluate underwriting results separately from investment results 
underwriting operations underwriting results we evaluate the underwriting results of our property and casualty insurance business in the aggregate and also for each of our separate business units 
net premiums written net premiums written amounted to billion in  a decrease of compared with net premiums written in decreased compared with net premiums written by business unit were as follows years ended december increase increase decrease decrease vs 
vs 
dollars in millions personal insurance commercial insurance specialty insurance total insurance reinsurance assumed total net premiums written from our insurance business were flat in compared with and grew in compared with premiums in the united states  which represent about of our insurance premiums  decreased in and in insurance premiums outside the us grew in and in the growth outside the us in and was largely attributable to the impact of currency fluctuation due to the weakness of the us dollar 
in both years  such growth was when measured in local currencies 
the overall lack of premium growth in both and reflected our continued emphasis on underwriting discipline in a highly competitive market environment 
rates were under competitive pressure that varied by class of business and geographic area 
in both years  we retained a high percentage of our existing customers and renewed these accounts at what we believe are acceptable rates relative to the risks 
while we continued to be disciplined  we found opportunities to write new business at acceptable rates  however  the number of such opportunities declined throughout and most of during the second half of  the property and casualty insurance market experienced disruption as a result of broader issues in the financial markets and the economies of the united states and other countries 
the crisis in the financial markets had an adverse impact on some of our competitors 
this has resulted in an increase in opportunities for us to write new business and we expect further opportunities in there are some factors that indicate that rates should increase during  but the timing and magnitude of those changes are difficult to predict 
although these developments should have a positive effect on our business in  we expect that the continued economic downturn will negatively impact our business in we expect net written premiums  excluding the impact of currency fluctuation  will be flat to modestly higher in compared with assuming the foreign currency to us dollar 
table of contents exchange rates remain at current levels  premium growth expressed in us dollars would be adversely affected  resulting in a modest decrease in premiums in compared to net reinsurance assumed premiums written decreased by in and in the significant premium decline reflects the sale of our ongoing reinsurance assumed business to harbor point limited in december  which is discussed below 
reinsurance ceded our premiums written are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers  who assume a portion of the risk under certain insurance policies we write that are subject to the reinsurance 
reinsurance rates generally remained steady in due in part to a relatively low level of catastrophes in capacity restrictions continued in some segments of the marketplace in both years 
our overall reinsurance costs were similar in and we did not renew our casualty clash treaty in as we believed the cost was not justified given the limited capacity and terms available 
the treaty had provided coverage of approximately of losses between million and million per insured event 
on our commercial property per risk treaty  in we increased the reinsurance coverage at the top of the program by million 
the structure of our property catastrophe program for events in the united states was modified in but the overall coverage was similar to the previous program 
in place of traditional reinsurance  we purchased fully collateralized four year reinsurance coverage for homeowners related losses sustained from qualifying hurricane loss events in the northeastern part of the united states 
this reinsurance was purchased from east lane re ltd  a cayman islands reinsurance company  which financed the provision of reinsurance through the issuance of million in catastrophe bonds to investors under two separate bond tranches 
reinsurance rates for property risks declined somewhat in capacity restrictions for certain coverages continued in the marketplace 
the overall cost of our property reinsurance program was modestly lower in than that in on our commercial property per risk treaty  in we increased the reinsurance coverage in the top layer of the treaty by million 
this treaty now provides approximately million of coverage per risk in excess of our million retention 
the structure of our property catastrophe program for events in the united states was again modified in  but the overall coverage remains similar to the previous program 
we purchased million of fully collateralized three year reinsurance coverage in place of traditional reinsurance 
this reinsurance was purchased from east lane re ii ltd  a cayman islands reinsurance company  which financed the provision of reinsurance through the issuance of million in catastrophe bonds to investors under three separate bond tranches 
the current traditional catastrophe reinsurance treaty  in combination with the collateralized coverage purchased in  provides coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and billion  with additional coverage of about of losses between billion and billion in the northeastern part of the united states  where we have our greatest concentration of catastrophe exposure 
the fully collateralized four year reinsurance coverage purchased in for homeowners related losses sustained from qualifying hurricane loss events in the northeastern part of the united states remains in effect and now provides coverage of approximately of covered losses between billion and billion 
we have additional reinsurance from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund  which is a state mandated fund designed to reimburse insurers for a portion of their residential catastrophic hurricane 
table of contents losses 
our participation in this program limits our initial retention in florida for homeowners related losses to approximately million 
on our property catastrophe treaty for events outside the united states  in  we increased the reinsurance coverage in the top layer of the treaty by million and modestly increased our participation in the program 
the treaty now provides coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and million 
our property reinsurance treaties generally contain terrorism exclusions for acts perpetrated by foreign terrorists  and for nuclear  biological  chemical and radiological loss causes whether such acts are perpetrated by foreign or domestic terrorists 
we do not expect the changes we made to our reinsurance program during and to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
most of our ceded reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss and catastrophe contracts that protect against a specified part or all of certain types of losses over stipulated amounts arising from any one occurrence or event 
therefore  unless we incur losses that exceed our initial retention under these contracts  we do not receive any loss recoveries 
as a result  in certain years  we cede premiums to other insurance companies and receive few  if any  loss recoveries 
however  in a year in which there is a significant catastrophic event or a series of large individual losses  we may receive substantial loss recoveries 
the impact of ceded reinsurance on net premiums written and earned and on net losses and loss expenses incurred for the three years ended december  is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our property reinsurance treaties represent the most significant component of our reinsurance program 
our major property reinsurance treaties expire on april  while we expect that reinsurance rates for property risks will increase in  the final structure of our program and amount of coverage purchased will be determinants of our total reinsurance costs in profitability the combined loss and expense ratio  expressed as a percentage  is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance business 
management evaluates the performance of our underwriting operations and of each of our business units using  among other measures  the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
it is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned loss ratio plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written expense ratio after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the combined ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under statutory accounting principles  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately  not at the time premiums are earned 
management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with gaap  among other measures  to assess the overall performance of our underwriting operations 
to convert statutory underwriting results to a gaap basis  policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
underwriting income determined in accordance with gaap is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and gaap underwriting expenses incurred 

table of contents underwriting results were highly profitable in each of the last three years  but somewhat less so in the combined loss and expense ratio for our overall property and casualty business was as follows years ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined loss and expense ratio the relatively low loss ratio in each of the last three years reflected the favorable loss experience which we believe resulted from our disciplined underwriting in recent years 
results in all three years  particularly and  benefited from favorable prior year loss development 
for more information on prior year loss development  see property and casualty insurance loss reserves  prior year loss development 
the loss ratio was higher in compared to due to higher catastrophe losses as well as declining earned premium rates and several large non catastrophe losses 
the loss ratio improved in compared to due to mild loss trends in certain classes of business 
in  net catastrophe losses incurred were million  which represented percentage points of the loss ratio 
about million of the catastrophe losses in related to hurricane ike  including our estimated share of an assessment from the texas windstorm insurance association  a windstorm insurance entity created by the state of texas 
net catastrophe losses incurred were million in  which represented percentage points of the loss ratio 
net catastrophe losses incurred in were million  which were offset in part by a million reduction in previously accrued reinsurance reinstatement premium costs related to hurricane katrina 
the net impact of catastrophes in accounted for percentage points of the loss ratio 
we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance treaties during the three year period ended december  because there was no individual catastrophe for which our losses exceeded our retention under the treaties 
our expense ratio was similar in and  as an increase in commissions was substantially offset by lower operating costs related to the run off of our reinsurance business 
the increase in commissions was largely the result of premium growth outside the united states in countries where commission rates are higher than in the united states as well as modestly higher commission rates in the united states in certain classes of business 
the compensation and other operating cost component of our expense ratio related to our ongoing businesses was identical in both years 
the expense ratio increased in compared to due primarily to higher commissions  largely the result of premium growth outside the united states in certain classes of business with relatively higher commission rates 
in lieu of paying contingent commissions  beginning in  we implemented a new guaranteed supplemental compensation program for agents and brokers in the united states with whom we previously had contingent commission agreements 
under this arrangement  agents and brokers are paid a percentage of written premiums on eligible lines of business in a calendar year based upon their prior performance 
the change in our commission arrangements created a difference in the timing of expense recognition  which resulted in a one time benefit to income during the transition year 
the impact of the change in was to increase deferred policy acquisition costs by approximately million 
the change had no effect on the expense ratio 

table of contents review of underwriting results by business unit personal insurance net premiums written from personal insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  increased by in and in net premiums written for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase increase vs 
vs 
dollars in millions automobile homeowners other total personal personal automobile premiums decreased in and due to a highly competitive us marketplace 
the termination of a collector vehicle program also contributed to the decrease in premium growth in our homeowners business was constrained in due to an increasingly competitive market as well as the slowdown in new housing construction as a result of the downturn in the us economy in the last half of the year 
the premium growth in was due primarily to increases in coverage relative to increases in the replacement cost of insured properties 
the in force policy count for this class of business decreased slightly in and was relatively flat in compared to our other personal business includes insurance for excess liability  yacht and accident and health coverages 
the substantial growth in this business in and was due primarily to a significant increase in accident and health premiums 
growth in accident and health business was particularly strong outside the united states in both years  growth was also strong in in the united states due in large part to a select initiative 
excess liability premiums also grew in both years  although more so in  due in part to a modest increase in rates 
our personal insurance business produced highly profitable underwriting results in each of the last three years  but less so in each succeeding year 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december automobile homeowners other total personal our personal automobile results were profitable in each of the past three years 
results in all three years benefited from lower claim frequency and modest favorable prior year loss development 
homeowners results were highly profitable in each of the last three years 
results in were adversely impacted by the higher severity of large non catastrophe losses 
results in benefited from relatively low catastrophe losses 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in other personal business produced modestly profitable results in each of the past three years 
our accident and health business was profitable in compared with highly profitable results in and our yacht business was unprofitable in compared with profitable results in and yacht results in were adversely affected by several large non catastrophe losses as well as several losses related to hurricane ike 
our excess liability business showed significant improvement in  
table of contents producing near breakeven results 
results for this business were unprofitable in and more so in due to inadequate pricing and unfavorable prior year loss development

vs 
dollars in millions multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial the decline in premiums in most of our commercial classes in and reflected the highly competitive marketplace  particularly for new business 
growth in the property and marine classes in was primarily from a syndicated large risks program in both the us and outside the us and a marine initiative 
the competitive rate pressures in in some of the commercial classes continued in these pressures affected all classes of business in the second half of and throughout  particularly for new business 
this resulted in modest decreases in renewal rates in most classes in both years 
rate declines were more pronounced in certain classes  such as workers compensation and large property risks  and also varied by geographic area 
retention levels of our existing customers remained steady over the last three years 
new business volume was slightly higher in but down in compared with the respective prior years 
the increase in was due to a few large accounts written in the first half of the year 
new business volume in the second half of and throughout was down as it became more difficult to find new opportunities at acceptable rates 
we have continued to maintain our underwriting discipline in the highly competitive market  renewing business and writing new business only where we believe we are securing acceptable rates and appropriate terms and conditions for the exposures 
our commercial insurance business produced less profitable underwriting results in than in and the less profitable results in were largely due to substantially higher catastrophe losses in the multiple peril and property and marine classes  primarily from hurricane ike 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for our commercial insurance business in  whereas such impact was percentage points in and negligible in results in all three years benefited from favorable loss experience  disciplined risk selection and appropriate terms and conditions in recent years 

table of contents the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within commercial insurance were as follows years ended december multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial multiple peril results were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
the less profitable results in were in the property component of this business largely due to higher catastrophe losses 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in the property component benefited from low non catastrophe losses in all three years  particularly outside the united states in results in the liability component were highly profitable in all three years 
results for our casualty business were similarly profitable in each of the past three years 
the automobile component of our casualty business was highly profitable in each of the past three years  but more so in results in the primary liability component were profitable in each of the past three years 
results in the excess liability component were profitable in and  to a lesser extent  in  compared with unprofitable results in excess liability results in and benefited from favorable prior year loss development  whereas results in were adversely affected by unfavorable loss development 
casualty results in and were adversely affected by incurred losses related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
our analysis of these exposures resulted in increases in the estimate of our ultimate liabilities 
such losses represented percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in and percentage points in the impact of such losses was not significant in workers compensation results were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
results in all three years benefited from our disciplined risk selection during the past several years as well as favorable claim cost trends  resulting in part from the positive effect of reforms in california 
the modestly less profitable results in were primarily due to lower earned premiums  which were due to rate reductions associated with state reforms and increased competition 
property and marine results were unprofitable in compared with highly profitable results in and the deterioration in results was due primarily to higher catastrophe losses  and to a lesser extent  an increase in the frequency and severity of large non catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio in and percentage points in the impact of catastrophes was negligible in excluding the impact of catastrophes  the combined ratio was  and in  and  respectively 

table of contents specialty insurance net premiums written from specialty insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  decreased by in and were flat in compared with the respective prior years 
net premiums written for the classes of business within the specialty insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase increase decrease decrease vs 
vs 
dollars in millions professional liability surety total specialty the decline in premiums in and for the professional liability classes of business was due to the highly competitive rate environment  particularly in the directors and officers liability component  and our commitment to maintain underwriting discipline in this environment 
renewal rates for the professional liability classes declined in compared to this downward trend continued in in most classes of business although it slowed as the year progressed  with overall rates for the professional liability classes being flat in the fourth quarter of rates for directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability insurance for financial institutions  however  increased throughout  particularly for those companies implicated in the crisis in the financial markets 
retention levels in the professional liability classes remained strong over the last three years 
new business volume declined modestly in each of the past two years due to the aggressive competition in the marketplace 
consistent with our strategy in recent years  we continued to direct our focus on small and middle market publicly traded and privately held companies 
we continued to get what we believe are acceptable rates and appropriate terms and conditions on both new business and renewals 
the substantial growth in net premiums written for our surety business in was due primarily to strong public sector construction 
growth slowed in due to a more competitive environment and the impact of the weaker economy on the construction business 
we expect these conditions will persist into our specialty insurance business produced profitable underwriting results in each of the last three years 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within specialty insurance were as follows years ended december professional liability surety total specialty our professional liability business produced highly profitable results in and compared with profitable results in the profitability of our professional liability business was particularly strong outside the united states in and the employment practices liability and fiduciary liability classes each produced highly profitable results in and  compared to profitable results in the directors and officers liability class was profitable in all three years  particularly in our errors and omissions liability business produced near breakeven results in and compared with highly unprofitable results in the fidelity class was highly profitable in each of the past three years 

table of contents collectively  the results for the professional liability classes benefited from favorable prior year loss development in and in and  to a much lesser extent  in  due to the recognition of the positive loss trends we have been experiencing related to accident years and prior 
these trends were largely the result of a favorable business climate  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
the expected loss ratio for the accident year in our professional liability business is above breakeven  and higher than the prior two years  due in part to the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing crisis in the financial markets 
our surety business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
results in were less profitable than results in and due to the adverse impact of one large loss 
our surety business tends to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses 
when losses occur  they are mitigated  at times  by recovery rights to the customer s assets  contract payments  collateral and bankruptcy recoveries 
the majority of our surety obligations are intended to be performance based guarantees 
we manage our exposure on an absolute basis and by specific bond type 
we have substantial commercial and construction surety exposure for current and prior customers  including exposures related to surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced deterioration in creditworthiness since we issued bonds to them 
we therefore may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses  especially in light of the ongoing economic downturn 
such losses would be recognized if and when claims are filed and determined to be valid  and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
reinsurance assumed in december  we completed a transaction involving a new bermuda based reinsurance company  harbor point limited 
as part of the transaction  we transferred our ongoing reinsurance assumed business and certain related assets  including renewal rights  to harbor point 
harbor point generally did not assume our reinsurance liabilities relating to reinsurance contracts incepting prior to december  we retained those liabilities and the related assets 
for a transition period of about two years  harbor point underwrote specific reinsurance business on our behalf 
we retained a portion of this business and ceded the balance to harbor point in return for a fronting commission 
we received additional payments based on the amount of business renewed by harbor point 
these amounts were recognized in income as earned 
net premiums written from our reinsurance assumed business  which is in run off  decreased by in and in the significant decrease in premiums in both years was expected in light of the sale of our ongoing reinsurance assumed business to harbor point 
reinsurance assumed results were profitable in each of the past three years 
while the volume of business declined substantially in each of the past three years  results in all three years  particularly in  benefited from significant favorable prior year loss development 
catastrophe risk management our property and casualty subsidiaries have exposure to losses caused by natural perils such as hurricanes and other windstorms  earthquakes  severe winter weather and brush fires and from man made catastrophic events such as terrorism 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 

table of contents natural catastrophes the extent of losses from a natural catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we regularly assess our concentration of risk exposures in catastrophe exposed areas globally and have strategies and underwriting standards to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
we have invested in modeling technologies and a risk concentration management tool that allow us to monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses in catastrophe exposed areas in the united states  such as california and the gulf and east coasts  as well as in such areas in other countries 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
we also continue to actively explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our ability to manage exposure under the insurance policies we issue 
despite these efforts  the occurrence of one or more severe natural catastrophic events in heavily populated areas could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
terrorism risk and legislation the september  attack changed the way the property and casualty insurance industry views catastrophic risk 
that tragic event demonstrated that numerous classes of business we write are subject to terrorism related catastrophic risks in addition to the catastrophic risks related to natural occurrences 
this  together with the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance  has required us to change how we identify and evaluate risk accumulations 
we have licensed a terrorism model that provides loss estimates under numerous event scenarios 
also  the above noted risk concentration management tool enables us to identify locations and geographic areas that are exposed to risk accumulations 
the information provided by the model and the tracking tool has resulted in our non renewing some accounts and has restricted us from writing others 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
the terrorism risk insurance act of tria established a temporary program under which the federal government will share the risk of loss arising from certain acts of foreign terrorism with the insurance industry 
the program  which was applicable to most lines of commercial business  was scheduled to terminate on december  in december  tria was extended through december  certain lines of business previously subject to the provisions of tria  including commercial automobile  surety and professional liability insurance  other than directors and officers liability  were excluded from the program 
in december  tria was extended through december  the amended law eliminated the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terrorism  now providing protection from all acts of terrorism 
otherwise  there were no significant changes to the key features of the program 
as a precondition to recovery under tria  insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united states for tria lines of business are required to make insurance for covered acts of terrorism available under their policies 
each insurer has a separate deductible that it must meet in the event of an act of terrorism before federal assistance becomes available 
the deductible is based on a percentage of direct us earned premiums for the covered lines of business in the previous calendar year 
for  that deductible is of direct premiums earned in for these lines of business 
for losses above the deductible  the federal government will pay for of covered losses  while the insurer retains 
there is a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of billion 
if acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the billion annual limit  insurers are not liable for additional losses 
while the provisions of tria will serve to mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial  approximating billion in 
table of contents for certain classes of business  such as workers compensation  terrorism insurance is mandatory 
for those classes of business where it is not mandatory  policyholders may choose not to accept terrorism insurance  which would  subject to other statutory or regulatory restrictions  reduce our exposure 
we will continue to manage this type of catastrophic risk by monitoring terrorism risk aggregations 
nevertheless  given the unpredictability of the targets  frequency and severity of potential terrorist events as well as the very limited terrorism reinsurance coverage available in the market  the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we also have exposure outside the united states to risk of loss from acts of terrorism 
in some jurisdictions  we have access to government mechanisms that would mitigate our exposure 
loss reserves unpaid losses and loss expenses  also referred to as loss reserves  are the largest liability of our property and casualty subsidiaries 
our loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims  less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries 
estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as prevailing economic  legal and social conditions 
our loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
we regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial techniques 
we update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops  additional claims are reported and or settled and new information becomes available 
any changes in estimates are reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimates are changed 
incurred but not reported ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses 
reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves 
the ibnr reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us  some of which are not yet known to the insured  as well as a provision for future development on reported claims 
a relatively large proportion of our net loss reserves  particularly for long tail liability classes  are reserves for ibnr losses 
in fact  more than of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr losses 

table of contents our gross case and ibnr loss reserves and related reinsurance recoverable by class of business were as follows net gross loss reserves reinsurance loss december  case ibnr total recoverable reserves in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance professional liability surety total specialty total insurance reinsurance assumed total net gross loss reserves reinsurance loss december  case ibnr total recoverable reserves in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance professional liability surety total specialty total insurance reinsurance assumed total 
table of contents loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  decreased by million or in loss reserves related to our insurance business increased by million  which reflects a decrease of approximately million related to currency fluctuation due to the strength of the us dollar at december  compared with december  loss reserves related to our reinsurance assumed business  which is in run off  decreased by million 
gross case reserves for our professional liability classes decreased by million in due primarily to generally low reported loss activity as well as settlements related to previously established case reserves and  to a lesser extent  the impact of currency fluctuation 
the significant increase in gross loss reserves for the commercial property and marine business was due to losses related to hurricane ike as well as several large non catastrophe losses incurred during the year that remained unpaid as of december  in establishing the loss reserves of our property and casualty subsidiaries  we consider facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
based on all information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
however  as described below  there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process 
it is therefore possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of december  may change  which could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
estimates and uncertainties the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
given the inherent complexity of the loss reserving process and the potential variability of the assumptions used  the actual emergence of losses could vary  perhaps substantially  from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements  particularly in those instances where settlements do not occur until well into the future 
our net loss reserves at december  were billion 
therefore  a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
reserves other than those relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
short tail classes consist principally of homeowners  commercial property and marine business 
for these classes  claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs and the claims relate to tangible property 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is less complex 
most of our loss reserves relate to long tail liability classes of business 
long tail classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and other professional liability coverages  commercial primary and excess liability  workers compensation and other liability coverages 
for many liability claims significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim 
as a result  loss experience in the more recent accident years for the long tail liability classes has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred or  in the case of claims made policies  the calendar year in which a loss is reported 
liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes 
table of contents is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability than for short tail classes 
as a result  the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates 
most of our reinsurance assumed business is long tail casualty reinsurance 
reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods 
the estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to us and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company 
our actuaries perform a comprehensive review of loss reserves for each of the numerous classes of business we write at least once a year 
the timing of such review varies by class of business and by jurisdiction 
the review process takes into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims in each particular class of business 
additionally  each quarter our actuaries review the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations and  as necessary  conduct reserve reviews for particular classes of business 
the loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
as part of that process  our actuaries use a variety of actuarial methods that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries in the loss reserve reviews include loss development factor methods  expected loss ratio methods  bornheutter ferguson methods and frequency severity methods 
loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amount observed so far 
historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year can be predictive of the expected future patterns that are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year 
expected loss ratio methods use loss ratios for prior accident years  adjusted to reflect our evaluation of recent loss trends  the current risk environment  changes in our book of business and changes in our pricing and underwriting  to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio for a given accident year 
the expected loss ratio for each accident year is multiplied by the earned premiums for that year to calculate estimated ultimate losses 
bornheutter ferguson methods are combinations of an expected loss ratio method and a loss development factor method  where the loss development factor method is given more weight as an accident year matures 
frequency severity methods first project ultimate claim counts using one or more of the other methods described above and then multiply those counts by an estimated average claim cost to calculate estimated ultimate losses 
the average claim costs are often estimated by fitting historical severity data to an observed trend 
generally  these methods work best for high frequency  low severity classes of business 
in completing their loss reserve analysis  our actuaries are required to determine the most appropriate actuarial methods to employ for each class of business 
within each class  the business is further segregated by accident year and where appropriate by jurisdiction 
each estimation method has its own pattern  parameter and or judgmental dependencies  with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods when applied to a particular class of business can also change over time  depending on the underlying circumstances 
in many cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the relevant class of business 
the manner of application and the degree of reliance on a given method will vary by class of business  by accident year and by jurisdiction based on our actuaries evaluation of the above dependencies and the potential volatility of the loss frequency and severity patterns 
the estimation methods selected or given weight by our actuaries at a particular valuation date are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated 

table of contents these selections incorporate input from claims personnel  pricing actuaries and underwriting management on loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates 
for short tail classes  the emergence of paid and incurred losses generally exhibits a reasonably stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next 
thus  for these classes  the loss development factor method is generally relatively straightforward to apply and usually requires only modest extrapolation 
for long tail classes  applying the loss development factor method often requires more judgment in selecting development factors as well as more significant extrapolation 
for those long tail classes with high frequency and relatively low per loss severity eg  workers compensation  volatility will often be sufficiently modest for the loss development factor method to be given significant weight  except in the most recent accident years 
for certain long tail classes of business  however  anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and erratic claim severity patterns 
these classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and commercial excess liability  among others 
for these classes  the loss development factor methods may not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses in the most recent accident years since many claims either have not yet been reported to us or are only in the early stages of the settlement process 
therefore  the actuarial estimates for these accident years are based on less extrapolatory methods  such as expected loss ratio and bornheutter ferguson methods 
over time  as a greater number of claims are reported and the statistical credibility of loss experience increases  loss development factor methods are given increasingly more weight 
using all the available data  our actuaries select an indicated loss reserve amount for each class of business based on the various assumptions  projections and methods 
the total indicated reserve amount determined by our actuaries is an aggregate of the indicated reserve amounts for the individual classes of business 
the ultimate outcome is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this indicated amount  but the indicated amount is not expected to be precisely the ultimate liability 
senior management meets with our actuaries at the end of each quarter to review the results of the latest loss reserve analysis 
based on this review  management determines the carried reserve for each class of business 
in making the determination  management considers numerous factors  such as changes in actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular class of business 
in doing so  management must evaluate whether a change in the data represents credible actionable information or an anomaly 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change until sometime later 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the carried loss reserves 
in general  changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business 
among the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves are the following changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care and home repair costs  changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage  changes in the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  legislative actions  changes in the medical condition of claimants  changes in our estimates of the number and or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements  changes in our book of business  
table of contents changes in our underwriting standards  and changes in our claim handling procedures 
in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal  judicial and social conditions change 
these issues have had  and may continue to have  a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
recent examples of such issues include the number of directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of the ongoing crisis in the financial markets  the number of directors and officers liability claims arising out of stock option backdating practices by certain public companies  the number and size of directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of investment banking practices and accounting and other corporate malfeasance  and exposure to claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long term exposure to harmful products or substances 
as a result of issues such as these  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have grown  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
as part of our loss reserving analysis  we take into consideration the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process 
those factors that could materially affect our loss reserve estimates include loss development patterns and loss cost trends  rate and exposure level changes  the effects of changes in coverage and policy limits  business mix shifts  the effects of regulatory and legislative developments  the effects of changes in judicial interpretations  the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and the effects of changes in claim handling practices 
in making estimates of reserves  however  we do not necessarily make an explicit assumption for each of these factors 
moreover  all estimation methods do not utilize the same assumptions and typically no single method is determinative in the reserve analysis for a class of business 
consequently  changes in our loss reserve estimates generally are not the result of changes in any one assumption 
instead  the variability will be affected by the interplay of changes in numerous assumptions  many of which are implicit to the approaches used 
for each class of business  we regularly adjust the assumptions and actuarial methods used in the estimation of loss reserves in response to our actual loss experience as well as our judgments regarding changes in trends and or emerging patterns 
in those instances where we primarily utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses  this may be reflected  for example  in the selection of revised loss development factors 
in those long tail classes of business that comprise a majority of our loss reserves and for which loss experience is less predictable due to potential changes in judicial interpretations  potential legislative actions and potential claims issues  this may be reflected in a judgmental change in our estimate of ultimate losses for particular accident years 
the future impact of the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process is extremely difficult to predict 
there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves  particularly for long tail classes of business 
we do not derive statistical loss distributions or outcome confidence levels around our loss reserve estimate 
actuarial ranges of reasonable estimates are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
this is due  among other reasons  to the fact that actuarial ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that were unknown as of the valuation date 
the following discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions for particular classes of business 
these impacts are estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among such assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take the amounts and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for our loss reserves in total 
we believe that the estimated variation in reserves detailed below is a reasonable estimate of the possible variation that may occur in the future 
however  if such variation did occur  it would likely occur over a period of several years and therefore its 
table of contents impact on the corporation s results of operations would be spread over the same period 
it is important to note  however  that there is the potential for future variation greater than the amounts discussed below 
two of the larger components of our loss reserves relate to the professional liability classes other than fidelity and to commercial excess liability 
the respective reported loss development patterns are key assumptions in estimating loss reserves for these classes of business  both as applied directly to more mature accident years and as applied indirectly eg  via bornheutter ferguson methods to less mature accident years 
reserves for the professional liability classes other than fidelity were billion  net of reinsurance  at december  based on a review of our loss experience  if the loss development factor for each accident year changed such that the cumulative loss development factor for the most recent accident year changed by  we estimate that the net reserves for professional liability classes other than fidelity would change by approximately million  in either direction 
this degree of change in the reported loss development pattern is within the historical variation around the averages in our data 
reserves for commercial excess liability excluding asbestos and toxic waste claims were billion  net of reinsurance  at december  these reserves are included within commercial casualty 
based on a review of our loss experience  if the loss development factor for each accident year changed such that the cumulative loss development factor for the most recent accident year changed by  we estimate that the net reserves for commercial excess liability would change by approximately million  in either direction 
this degree of change in the reported loss development pattern is within the historical variation around the averages in our data 
reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
instead  we rely on an exposure based analysis that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures 
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  we generally evaluate our exposure on a policyholder by policyholder basis  considering a variety of factors that are unique to each policyholder 
quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management s judgment 
we establish case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
we believe that the loss reserves carried at december  for asbestos and toxic waste claims were adequate 
however  given the judicial decisions and legislative actions that have broadened the scope of coverage and expanded theories of liability in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  it is possible that our estimate of loss reserves relating to these exposures may increase in future periods as new information becomes available and as claims develop 
asbestos reserves 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
tort theory affecting asbestos litigation has evolved over the years 
early court cases established the continuous trigger theory with respect to insurance coverage 
under this theory  insurance coverage is deemed to be triggered from the time a claimant is first exposed to asbestos until the manifestation of any disease 
this interpretation of a policy trigger can involve insurance policies over many years and increases 
table of contents insurance companies exposure to liability 
until recently  judicial interpretations and legislative actions attempted to maximize insurance availability from both a coverage and liability standpoint 
new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued despite the fact that usage of asbestos has declined since the mid s 
many claimants were exposed to multiple asbestos products over an extended period of time 
as a result  claim filings typically name dozens of defendants 
the plaintiffs bar has solicited new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
a vast majority of asbestos bodily injury claims have been filed by claimants who do not show any signs of asbestos related disease 
new asbestos cases are often filed in those jurisdictions with a reputation for judges and juries that are extremely sympathetic to plaintiffs 
approximately manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products have filed for bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
a bankruptcy sometimes involves an agreement to a plan between the debtor and its creditors  including current and future asbestos claimants 
although the debtor is negotiating in part with its insurers money  insurers are generally given only limited opportunity to be heard 
in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims  bankruptcy proceedings have also caused increased settlement demands against remaining solvent defendants 
there have been some positive legislative and judicial developments in the asbestos environment over the past several years various challenges to mass screening claimants have been mounted  including a june us district court decision in texas 
many believe that this decision is leading to higher medical evidentiary standards 
for example  several asbestos injury settlement trusts suspended their acceptance of claims that were based on the diagnosis of physicians or screening companies named in the case  citing concerns about their reliability 
further investigations of the medical screening process for asbestos claims are underway 
a number of states have implemented legislative and judicial reforms that focus the courts resources on the claims of the most seriously injured 
those who allege serious injury and can present credible evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts  while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or are placed on an inactive docket  which preserves the right to pursue litigation in the future 
a number of key jurisdictions have adopted venue reform that requires plaintiffs to have a connection to the jurisdiction in order to file a complaint 
in recognition that many aspects of bankruptcy plans are unfair to certain classes of claimants and to the insurance industry  these plans are beginning to be closely scrutinized by the courts and rejected when appropriate 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve products liability on the part of traditional defendants who were engaged in the manufacture  distribution or installation of asbestos products 
we wrote excess liability and or general liability coverages for these insureds 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  their exposure has become substantial due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures involve products and non products liability on the part of peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos in small quantities and owners or operators of properties where asbestos was present 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these viable peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for large awards 

table of contents asbestos claims against the major manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products were typically presented under the products liability section of primary general liability policies as well as under excess liability policies  both of which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s exposure 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims by insureds are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of primary general liability policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits on coverage  creating potentially greater exposure 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits 
it is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non products coverage or whether insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses 
accordingly  the ultimate cost to insurers of the claims for coverage not subject to aggregate limits is uncertain 
in establishing our asbestos reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the available insurance coverage  limits and deductibles  the jurisdictions involved  past settlement values of similar claims  the potential role of other insurance  particularly underlying coverage below our excess liability policies  potential bankruptcy impact  relevant judicial interpretations  and applicable coverage defenses  including asbestos exclusions 
we have assumed a continuation of the current legal environment with no benefit from any federal asbestos reform legislation 
various federal proposals to solve the ongoing asbestos litigation crisis have been considered by the us congress over the past few years  but none have yet been enacted 
thus  the prospect of federal asbestos reform legislation remains uncertain 
our actuaries and claim personnel perform periodic analyses of our asbestos related exposures 
the analyses during noted positive developments  including several settlements  related to certain of our traditional asbestos defendants 
at the same time  the analyses indicated that our exposure to loss from claims against our peripheral defendants was somewhat higher than previously expected 
the analyses during noted an increase in our estimate of the ultimate liabilities related to certain of our traditional asbestos defendants 
based on these analyses  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million in and million in the analyses during noted no developments that would indicate the need to change our estimate of ultimate liabilities related to asbestos claims 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves related to asbestos claims

number of net loss net losses policyholders reserves paid in millions traditional defendants peripheral defendants future claims from unknown policyholders significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability related to asbestos related claims 
this uncertainty is due to several factors including the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims  plaintiffs expanding theories of liability and increased focus on peripheral defendants  the volume of claims by unimpaired plaintiffs and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims  the efforts by insureds to claim the right to non products coverage not subject to aggregate limits  the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities  the ability of claimants to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure  the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on excess liability policies we have issued  inconsistent court decisions and diverging legal interpretations  and the possibility  however remote  of federal legislation that would address the asbestos problem 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
toxic waste reserves 
toxic waste claims relate primarily to pollution and related cleanup costs 
our insureds have two potential areas of exposure hazardous waste dump sites and pollution at the insured site primarily from underground storage tanks and manufacturing processes 
the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund has been interpreted to impose strict  retroactive and joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties prps for the cost of remediating hazardous waste sites 
most sites have multiple prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present landowners or past or present site operators 
these prps had proper government authorization in many instances 
however  relative fault has not been a factor in establishing liability 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover claims arising from gradual pollution 
since  most policies have specifically excluded such exposures 
environmental remediation claims tendered by prps and others to insurers have frequently resulted in disputes over insurers contractual obligations with respect to pollution claims 
the resulting litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 

table of contents there is substantial uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given waste site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  and has not been re enacted 
federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability has occasionally shifted to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
in a few states  we have seen cases brought against insureds or directly against insurance companies for environmental pollution and natural resources damages 
to date  only a few natural resource claims have been filed and they are being vigorously defended 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
in establishing our toxic waste reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the probable liability  available insurance coverage  past settlement values of similar claims  relevant judicial interpretations  applicable coverage defenses as well as facts that are unique to each insured 
during  the analysis of our toxic waste exposures indicated that some of our insureds had become responsible for the remediation of additional polluted sites and that  as clean up standards continue to evolve as a result of technology advances  the estimated cost of remediation of certain sites had increased 
in addition  two claims were settled at substantially higher amounts than expected 
based on these developments  we increased our net toxic waste loss reserves by million in the following table presents a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  related to toxic waste claims 
the reinsurance recoverable related to these claims is minimal 
years ended december in millions reserves  beginning of year incurred losses losses paid reserves  end of year of the net toxic waste loss reserves at december   million was ibnr reserves 
reinsurance recoverable 
reinsurance recoverable is the estimated amount recoverable from reinsurers related to the losses we have incurred 
at december   reinsurance recoverable included million recoverable with respect to paid losses and loss expenses  which is included in other assets  and billion recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 
reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses represents an estimate of the portion of our gross loss reserves that will be recovered from reinsurers 
such reinsurance recoverable is estimated as part of our loss reserving process using assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used in estimating the gross loss reserves 
consequently  the estimation of reinsurance recoverable is subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves 

table of contents ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  placing reinsurance with only those reinsurers who we believe have strong balance sheets and superior underwriting ability  and we monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
nevertheless  in recent years  certain of our reinsurers have experienced financial difficulties or exited the reinsurance business 
in addition  we may become involved in coverage disputes with our reinsurers 
a provision for estimated uncollectible reinsurance is recorded based on periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers  the financial condition of the reinsurers  coverage disputes and other relevant factors 
prior year loss development because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events  changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed 
reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening 
reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases 
a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance  for the three years ended december  is as follows in millions net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years net payments for losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years foreign currency translation effect net loss reserves  end of year during  we experienced overall favorable prior year development of million  which represented of the net loss reserves as of december  this compares with favorable prior year development of million during  which represented of the net loss reserves at december   and favorable prior year development of million during  which represented of the net loss reserves at december  such favorable development was reflected in operating results in these respective years 

table of contents the following table presents the overall prior year loss development for the three years ended december  by accident year 
calendar year favorable unfavorable development accident year in millions and prior the net favorable development of million in was due to various factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced favorable development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity  including about million outside the us favorable development occurred in each of the primary professional liability classes  including directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability  fiduciary liability and employment practices liability 
a majority of this favorable development was in the and accident years 
reported loss activity related to these accident years has been less than expected due to a favorable business climate  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
as these years have become increasingly mature  and as the reported loss experience has emerged better than we expected  we have gradually decreased the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
this favorable development was recognized as one among many factors in the determination of loss reserves for more current accident years 
our estimates of expected loss ratios for more recent accident years  particularly and  were more influenced by the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing crisis in the financial markets as well as the downward trend in prices in recent years 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the homeowners and commercial property classes  primarily related to the and accident years 
the severity of late reported property claims that emerged during was lower than expected 
because the incidence of such property losses is subject to a considerable element of fortuity  reserve estimates for these classes are based on an analysis of past loss experience on average over a period of years 
as a result  the favorable development in was recognized but had a relatively modest effect on our determination of carried property loss reserves at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the commercial liability classes 
favorable development  particularly in excess liability and multiple peril liability classes in accident years through  more than offset adverse development in accident years prior to  which was mostly due to million of incurred losses related to toxic waste claims 
the severity of excess liability and multiple peril liability claims has been generally lower than expected and the effects of underwriting changes that affected these years have been more positive than expected 
these factors were reflected in the determination of the carried loss reserves for these classes at december  
table of contents we experienced favorable development of about million in the fidelity class due to lower than expected reported loss emergence  particularly outside the us  mainly related to recent accident years 
loss reserve estimates at the end of included an expectation of more late reported losses than actually occurred in  and this factor was reflected in the determination of carried fidelity loss reserves at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the run off of our reinsurance assumed business due primarily to better than expected reported loss activity from cedants 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the workers compensation class due in part to the positive effects of reforms in california 
this factor was reflected in the determination of carried loss reserves for this class at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the personal automobile business due primarily to lower than expected severity 
this factor was given only modest weight in our determination of carried personal automobile loss reserves at december  the net favorable development of million in was also due to various factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced favorable development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity  including about million outside the us a majority of this favorable development was in the through accident years 
reported loss activity related to these accident years was less than expected due to a favorable business climate  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
while these accident years were still somewhat immature  we concluded that there was sufficient evidence to modestly decrease the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the homeowners and commercial property classes  primarily related to the and accident years 
this favorable development arose from the lower than expected emergence of actual losses during relative to expectations used to establish our loss reserves at the end of the severity of late reported property claims that emerged during was lower than expected and case development  including salvage recoveries  on previously reported claims was better than expected 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the run off of our reinsurance assumed business due primarily to better than expected reported loss activity from cedants 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the fidelity class and million in the surety class due to lower than expected reported loss emergence  mainly related to more recent accident years 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the personal automobile class 
case development during on previously reported claims was better than expected  reflecting improved case management 
also  the number of late reported claims was less than expected  reflecting a continuation of recent generally favorable frequency trends 
we experienced adverse development of about million in the commercial liability classes 
adverse development in accident years prior to  mostly the million related to asbestos and toxic waste claims  was largely offset by favorable development in these classes in the more recent accident years 
the net favorable development of million in was also due to various factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced favorable development of about million in the homeowners and commercial property classes  primarily related to the accident year 
this favorable development arose from the lower than expected emergence of actual losses during relative to expectations used to establish our loss reserves at the end of the severity of late reported property claims that

we experienced favorable development of about million in the run off of our reinsurance assumed business due primarily to better than expected reported loss activity from cedants 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity 
favorable development in the and accident years more than offset continued unfavorable development in accident years through reported loss activity related to accident years and was less than expected due to a favorable business climate  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
while these accident years were somewhat immature  we concluded that there was sufficient evidence to modestly decrease the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
on the other hand  we continued to experience higher than expected reported loss activity related to the through accident years  largely from claims related to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities 
as a result  we increased the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the personal automobile class 
case development during on previously reported claims was better than expected  reflecting improved case management 
the number of late reported claims was also less than expected 
we experienced adverse development of about million in the commercial liability classes  including million related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the adverse development was primarily due to reported loss activity in accident years prior to that was worse than expected  primarily related to specific individual excess liability and other liability claims 
in item of this report  we present an analysis of our consolidated loss reserve development on a calendar year basis for each of the ten years prior to the variability in reserve development over the ten year period illustrates the uncertainty of the loss reserving process 
conditions and trends that have affected reserve development in the past will not necessarily recur in the future 
it is not appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable reserve development based on amounts experienced in prior years 
our us property and casualty subsidiaries are required to file annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such authorities 
these annual statements include an analysis of loss reserves  referred to as schedule p  that presents accident year loss development information by line of business for the nine years prior to it is our intention to post the schedule p for our combined us property and casualty subsidiaries on our website as soon as it becomes available 
investment results property and casualty investment income before taxes increased by in compared with and by in compared with growth in investment income in was due to an increase in average invested assets compared with the growth in investment income in was limited as average invested assets increased only modestly during the year as a result of substantial dividend distributions made by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb during and growth in compared with was due to an increase in invested assets  which reflected substantial cash flow from operations over the period 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in while similar in these years  the effective tax rate does fluctuate as a result of our holding a different proportion of our investment portfolio in tax exempt securities during different periods 

table of contents on an after tax basis  property and casualty investment income increased by in and in the after tax annualized yield on the investment portfolio that supports our property and casualty insurance business was in compared with in and in management uses property and casualty investment income after tax  a non gaap financial measure  to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax 
during the latter part of  the us dollar strengthened compared to several of the foreign currencies in which we hold invested assets and the yields on short term investments in the us were historically low 
assuming investment yields and foreign exchange rates remain at current levels  property and casualty investment income is expected to decrease modestly in compared with other income other income  which includes miscellaneous income and expenses of the property and casualty subsidiaries  was not significant in the last three years 
corporate and other corporate and other comprises investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocated to our operating subsidiaries and the results of our non insurance subsidiaries  including chubb financial solutions  which is in run off 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the higher loss in compared to was due to higher interest expense and lower investment income 
the higher interest expense was due to higher average debt outstanding in as a result of the issuance of additional debt during and the lower investment income was primarily the result of a decrease in the average yield on short term investments 
the higher loss in compared with was due primarily to higher interest expense as a result of the issuance of additional debt during the first half of the higher interest expense in and was not offset by an increase in investment income as the proceeds from the issuance of the debt were used to repurchase chubb s common stock 
chubb financial solutions the business of chubb financial solutions cfs was primarily structured credit derivatives  principally as a counterparty in portfolio credit default swap contracts 
in  the corporation announced its intention to exit cfs s business 
since that date  cfs has terminated early or run off nearly all of its contractual obligations within its financial products portfolio 
as of december   no credit default swap contracts remained outstanding 
cfs s aggregate exposure  or retained risk  from each of its remaining in force financial products contracts is referred to as notional amount 
notional amounts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual cash flows and are not necessarily representative of the potential for gain or loss 
the notional amounts are not recorded on the balance sheet 
cfs s remaining financial products contracts at december  included a derivative contract linked to an equity market index that terminates in and a few other insignificant transactions 
we estimate that the notional amount under the remaining contracts was about million and the fair value of our future obligations was million at december  
table of contents realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains and losses were as follows years ended december in millions net realized gains losses equity securities fixed maturities other invested assets harbor point other than temporary impairment losses equity securities fixed maturities realized investment gains losses before tax realized investment gains losses after tax decisions to sell equity securities and fixed maturities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
as a result  realized gains and losses on the sale of these investments may vary significantly from period to period 
however  such gains and losses generally have little  if any  impact on shareholders equity as all of these investments are carried at fair value  with the unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in comprehensive income 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
the net realized gains and losses on other invested assets represent the aggregate of distributions to us from the limited partnerships in which we have an interest and changes in our equity in the net assets of the partnerships based on valuations provided to us by the manager of each partnership 
due to the timing of our receipt of valuation data from the investment managers  these investments are reported on a one quarter lag 
we have not yet received fourth quarter valuations from many of the limited partnerships 
based on limited preliminary information about the performance of the limited partnerships during the fourth quarter  we expect to report a decline in our equity in the net assets of these partnerships in our first quarter results 
we cannot precisely quantify the amount of the loss that we will report  however  we currently expect that the loss before tax will be about million  but it is possible the loss could exceed that amount 
in  we transferred our ongoing reinsurance business and certain related assets to harbor point limited 
in exchange  we received from harbor point million of convertible notes and warrants to purchase common stock of harbor point 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of million  of which million was recognized in in  the notes were converted to  shares of common stock of harbor point and we recognized the remaining million gain 
we regularly review those invested assets that have a fair value that is less than cost to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
we have a monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting professionals that is responsible for identifying those securities to be specifically evaluated for a potential other than temporary impairment 
the determination of whether a decline in value of any investment is temporary or other than temporary requires the judgment of management 
in making the determination  we consider various quantitative criteria and qualitative factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair 
table of contents value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our cost  general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
a fixed maturity security is other than temporarily impaired if it becomes likely that we will not be able to collect all amounts due under the security s contractual terms or if we cannot assert that we will hold the security until we recover our cost 
an equity security is other than temporarily impaired if it becomes likely that we will not recover our cost in the near term 
if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is deemed to be other than temporary  the difference between cost and fair value is charged to income as a realized investment loss 
the fair value of the investment becomes its new cost basis 
the decision to recognize a decline in the value of a security carried at fair value as other than temporary rather than temporary has no impact on shareholders equity 
as a result of significant financial market disruption during  the fair value of many of our investments declined to a level below our cost 
the issuers of the equity securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired during were among a range of industries and not concentrated within any individual sector 
about of the fixed maturities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired were corporate securities within the financial services sector 
through december   we continued to receive contractual principal and interest payments on nearly all of our other than temporarily impaired fixed maturity securities 
if current conditions in the equity and fixed maturity markets continue in or if conditions deteriorate  additional securities may be deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
information related to investment securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and is included in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources and liquidity represent a company s overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs 
capital resources capital resources provide protection for policyholders  furnish the financial strength to support the business of underwriting insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 
at december   the corporation had shareholders equity of billion and total debt of billion 
in april  chubb repaid million of outstanding notes when due 
in may  chubb issued million of unsecured senior notes due in and million of senior notes due in in march  chubb issued billion of unsecured junior subordinated capital securities 
the capital securities will become due on april   the scheduled maturity date  but only to the extent that chubb has received sufficient net proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying capital securities 
chubb must use its commercially reasonable efforts  subject to certain market disruption events  to sell enough qualifying capital securities to permit repayment of the capital securities on the scheduled maturity date or as soon thereafter as possible 
any remaining outstanding principal amount will be due on march   the final maturity date 
the capital securities bear interest at a fixed rate of through april  thereafter  the capital securities will bear interest at a rate equal to the three month libor rate plus 
subject to certain conditions  chubb has the right to defer the payment of interest on the capital securities for a period not exceeding ten consecutive years 
during any such period  interest will continue to accrue and chubb generally may not declare or pay any dividends on or purchase any shares of its capital stock 

table of contents in connection with the issuance of the capital securities  chubb entered into a replacement capital covenant in which it agreed that it will not repay  redeem or purchase the capital securities before march   unless  subject to certain limitations  it has received proceeds from the sale of replacement capital securities  as defined 
subject to the replacement capital covenant  the capital securities may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at any time on or after april  at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus any accrued interest or prior to april  at a redemption price equal to the greater of i the principal amount or ii a make whole amount  in each case plus any accrued interest 
in  chubb issued million of unsecured senior notes due in and million purchase contracts to purchase its common stock 
the notes and purchase contracts were issued together in the form of equity units  each of which initially represented principal amount of notes and one purchase contract 
in may  the notes were successfully remarketed as required by their terms 
the interest rate on the notes was reset to from  effective may  each purchase contract obligated the holder to purchase  on or before august   for a settlement price of  a variable number of shares of chubb s common stock 
the number of shares purchased was determined based on a formula that considered the market price of chubb s common stock immediately prior to the time of settlement in relation to the per share sale price of the common stock at the time the equity units were offered 
upon settlement of the purchase contracts in august  chubb issued  shares of common stock and received proceeds of million 
in august  the million of notes were paid when due 
chubb also has outstanding million of notes due in  million of notes due in  million of debentures due in  million of debentures due in and million of notes due in  all of which are unsecured 
management regularly monitors the corporation s capital resources 
in connection with our long term capital strategy  chubb from time to time contributes capital to its property and casualty subsidiaries 
in addition  in order to satisfy capital needs as a result of any rating agency capital adequacy or other future rating issues  or in the event we were to need additional capital to make strategic investments in light of market opportunities  we may take a variety of actions  which could include the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
we believe that our strong financial position and conservative debt level provide us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financings on both a short term and long term basis 
in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of chubb s common stock 
in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of common stock 
in march  the board of directors authorized an increase of  shares to the december authorization 
in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of common stock 
in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of common stock 
in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock through a combination of an accelerated stock buyback program and open market transactions  at an aggregate cost of  million 
in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock in open market transactions at a cost of  million 
in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock in open market transactions at a cost of  million 
as of december    shares remained under the december share repurchase authorization  which has no expiration date 
the number of shares we will repurchase in will depend on the state of the global capital markets and the potential for profitable growth in the property and casualty insurance market 

table of contents ratings chubb and its insurance subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies 
these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders 
credit ratings assess a company s ability to make timely payments of interest and principal on its debt 
the following table summarizes the corporation s credit ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of february  am best standard poor s moody s fitch senior unsecured debt aa a a a junior subordinated capital securities a a a a commercial paper amb a p f financial strength ratings assess an insurer s ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders 
the following table summarizes our property and casualty subsidiaries financial strength ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of february  am best standard poor s moody s fitch financial strength a aa aa aa ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in the insurance markets 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
it is possible that one or more of the rating agencies may raise or lower our existing ratings in the future 
if our credit ratings were downgraded  we might incur higher borrowing costs and might have more limited means to access capital 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our insurance operations  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
the corporation s liquidity requirements in the past have generally been met by funds from operations and we expect that in the future funds from operations will continue to be sufficient to meet such requirements 
liquidity requirements could also be met by funds from the maturity or sale of marketable securities in our investment portfolio 
the corporation also has the ability to borrow under its credit facility and we believe we could issue debt or equity securities 
our property and casualty operations provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to chubb 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows are used to build the investment portfolio and thereby increase future investment income 
our strong underwriting results continued to generate substantial new cash in new cash from operations available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately million in compared with billion in and billion in new cash available in was lower than in due to a million increase in dividends paid by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb and higher loss payments  partially offset by lower income tax payments 
new cash available was lower in than in due to a million increase in dividends paid by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb and  to a lesser extent  higher income tax payments 

table of contents our property and casualty subsidiaries maintain substantial investments in highly liquid  short term marketable securities 
accordingly  we do not anticipate selling long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs 
chubb s liquidity requirements primarily include the payment of dividends to shareholders and interest and principal on debt obligations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to chubb s shareholders will be at the discretion of chubb s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
as a holding company  chubb s ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders and to satisfy its debt obligations relies on the availability of liquid assets  which is dependent in large part on the dividend paying ability of its property and casualty subsidiaries 
our property and casualty subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate that restrict the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
the restrictions are generally based on net income and on certain levels of policyholders surplus as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
dividends in excess of such thresholds are considered extraordinary and require prior regulatory approval 
during  and  these subsidiaries paid dividends to chubb of  million   million and million  respectively 
the maximum dividend distribution that may be made by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb during without prior approval is approximately billion 
chubb has a revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that provides for up to million of unsecured borrowings 
there have been no borrowings under this agreement 
various interest rate options are available to chubb  all of which are based on market interest rates 
the agreement contains customary restrictive covenants including a covenant to maintain a minimum consolidated shareholders equity  as adjusted 
at december   chubb was in compliance with all such covenants 
the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and to support our commercial paper borrowing arrangement 
this agreement has a termination date of october  in august  the agreement was amended to allow chubb to request on two occasions at any time during the remaining term of the agreement an extension of the maturity date for an additional one year period 
on the termination date of the agreement  any borrowings then outstanding become payable 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table provides our future payments due by period under contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type of obligation 
and and there after total in millions principal due under long term debt interest payments on long term debt a future minimum rental payments under operating leases loss and loss expense reserves b total a junior subordinated capital securities of billion bear interest at a fixed rate of through april  and at a rate equal to the three month libor rate plus thereafter 
for purposes of the above table  interest after april  was calculated using the three month libor rate as of december  the table includes future interest payments through the scheduled maturity date  april  interest payments for the period from the scheduled maturity date through the final maturity date  march   would increase the contractual obligation by billion 
it is 
table of contents our expectation that the capital securities will be redeemed at the end of the fixed interest rate period 
b there is typically no stated contractual commitment associated with property and casualty insurance loss reserves 
the obligation to pay a claim arises only when a covered loss event occurs and a settlement is reached 
the vast majority of our loss reserves relate to claims for which settlements have not yet been reached 
our loss reserves therefore represent estimates of future payments 
these estimates are dependent on the outcome of claim settlements that will occur over many years 
accordingly  the payment of the loss reserves is not fixed as to either amount or timing 
the estimate of the timing of future payments is based on our historical loss payment patterns 
the ultimate amount and timing of loss payments will likely differ from our estimate and the differences could be material 
we expect that these loss payments will be funded  in large part  by future cash receipts from operations 
the above table excludes certain commitments totaling billion at december  to fund limited partnership investments 
these commitments can be called by the partnerships generally over a period of five years or less  if and when needed by the partnerships to fund certain partnership expenses or the purchase of investments 
it is uncertain whether and  if so  when we will be required to fund these commitments 
there is no predetermined payment schedule 
the corporation does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the corporation s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources  other than as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
invested assets the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to ensure that funds will be available to meet our insurance obligations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors of chubb and its respective operating companies 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of high quality bonds  principally tax exempt securities  mortgage backed securities  corporate issues and us treasury securities  as well as foreign government and corporate bonds that support our operations outside the united states 
the portfolio also includes equity securities  primarily publicly traded common stocks  and other invested assets  primarily private equity limited partnerships  all of which are held with the primary objective of capital appreciation 
limited partnership investments by their nature are less liquid and involve more risk than other investments 
we actively manage our risk through type of asset class and domestic and international diversification 
at december   we had investments in about separate partnerships 
we review the performance of these investments on a quarterly basis and we obtain audited financial statements annually 
in our us operations  during  we invested new cash in tax exempt bonds and taxable bonds 
the taxable bonds we invested in were corporate bonds while we reduced our holdings of mortgage backed securities 
in  we invested new cash in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  taxable bonds  equity securities and limited partnerships 
the taxable bonds we invested in were corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities while we reduced our holdings of us treasury securities 
in  we invested new cash in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities and limited partnerships  whereas we decreased our holdings of taxable bonds  principally us treasury securities 
our objective is to achieve the appropriate mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
at december   of our us fixed 
table of contents maturity portfolio was invested in tax exempt bonds compared with at december  and at december  we classify our fixed maturity securities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value 
changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed maturity investments 
while a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new investments  it reduces the fair value of existing fixed maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition 
a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the fair value of existing investments  creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition 
the net unrealized depreciation before tax of our fixed maturities and equity securities carried at fair value was million at december  compared with net unrealized appreciation of million at december  and net unrealized appreciation of million at december  such unrealized appreciation and depreciation is reflected in comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
credit spreads  which refer to the difference between a risk free yield the yield on us treasury securities and the actual yields on all other fixed maturity investments  increased significantly during due to the declines in the financial markets 
this resulted in a decline in the fair value of many of our fixed maturity investments 
pension and other postretirement benefits as a result of the turmoil in the financial markets during  the fair value of the assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased significantly 
as a result  the funded status of these plans deteriorated 
due primarily to this decline  postretirement benefit costs not yet recognized in net income increased by million  which was reflected in comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
the increase in the amortization of net losses resulting from the decrease in value of these assets will not have a material adverse effect on results of operations in employee benefits are discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which is sensitive to changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we also have exposure to market risks through our debt obligations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
investment portfolio interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security that promises a fixed return to changes in interest rates 
when market interest rates rise  the fair value of our fixed income securities decreases 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our 
table of contents property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration 
expressed in years  duration is the weighted average payment period of cash flows  where the weighting is based on the present value of the cash flows 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the estimated duration of these liabilities and other factors  which allows us to prudently manage the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns

we have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
only about of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
our investment portfolio does not have any direct exposure to either sub prime mortgages or collateralized debt obligations 
our tax exempt bonds mature on average in nine years  while our taxable bonds have an average maturity of five years 
about of our tax exempt bonds are rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s with about rated aaa 
the average rating of our tax exempt bonds is aa 
while about of our tax exempt bonds are insured  the effect of insurance on the average credit rating of these bonds is insignificant 
the insured tax exempt bonds in our portfolio have been selected based on the quality of the underlying credit and not the value of the credit insurance enhancement 
about of the taxable bonds  other than mortgage backed securities  in our portfolio are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or by foreign governments or are rated aa or better 

table of contents mortgage backed securities comprised of our taxable bond portfolio at year end about of the mortgage backed securities are rated aaa and the remaining are all investment grade 
of the aaa rated securities  about are residential mortgage backed securities  consisting of government agency pass through securities guaranteed by a government agency or a government sponsored enterprise gse  gse collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and other cmos  all backed by single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets 
the other of the aaa rated securities are call protected  commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs 
about of our cmbs are senior securities with the highest level of subordination 
the remainder of our cmbs are seasoned securities that were issued in or earlier 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life of a security  potentially reducing or increasing its effective yield 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of residential mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the fair value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we seek to mitigate the risks relating to currency fluctuations by generally maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities  thereby limiting exchange rate risk to the net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held foreign currency denominated investments of billion supporting their international operations 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the euro  the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling

our publicly traded equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market price of each of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio
