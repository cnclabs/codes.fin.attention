item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel peptide based drug candidates to improve the treatment of serious and often life threatening conditions 
our product candidate  hematide  is designed to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure 
anemia is a serious condition in which blood is deficient in red blood cells and hemoglobin 
it is common in patients with chronic renal failure  cancer  heart failure  inflammatory diseases and other critical illnesses  as well as in the elderly 
if left untreated  anemia may increase the risk of other diseases or death 
hematide is a synthetic peptide based erythropoiesis stimulating agent  or esa  designed to stimulate production of red blood cells 
hematide is designed to be longer acting than currently marketed esas in the us  and therefore has the potential to offer both better care for patients and reduced cost and complexity for healthcare providers 
we are conducting phase clinical trials in patients suffering from chronic renal failure  on dialysis and pre dialysis 
we are conducting four open label  randomized controlled clinical trials 
of these trials  two trials are being conducted in pre dialysis patients and are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hematide compared to darbepoetin alfa to correct anemia and maintain hemoglobin in a corrected range over time 
the other two trials are being conducted in dialysis patients and are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hematide and its ability to maintain hemoglobin levels in a corrected range compared to epoetin alpha or epoetin beta when switched to hematide 
analysis of efficacy and safety for all of the phase studies will be based on assessments of non inferiority to the comparator drugs 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be the mean change in hemoglobin from baseline 
each study is planned to continue until the last patient has been treated for approximately weeks 
in addition  the assessment of safety will include a composite cardiovascular endpoint from a pooled safety database 
currently  we expect to release results from the phase clinical program in the first quarter of  however  the rate of accrual of cardiovascular events could affect the duration of the studies 
if the cardiovascular events accrue at a lower rate than estimated  the outcome of the composite safety endpoint analysis may not meet the pre defined non inferiority criteria due to insufficient events  causing a possible failure of our clinical program 
in order to obtain additional data to compensate for a lower than estimated cardiovascular event rate  the phase clinical program may need to be extended or additional studies may need to be conducted  if even feasible  which could delay the development of hematide and the achievement of milestones from our collaboration partner  takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or takeda 
even if the cardiovascular events accrue at the estimated rate  we could still fail to establish that hematide is non inferior to the comparator drugs upon analysis of the data from our phase clinical program 
further  our phase clinical program could be suspended or terminated prior to completion based on safety or other concerns  including recommendations of the data monitoring committee  which will be meeting periodically to review the interim safety data from our trials 
in august  we and takeda agreed to suspend development of hematide to treat chemotherapy induced anemia and to focus all development efforts on our renal program 
to date  we have not generated any product revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  reimbursement for development expenses and active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  production  license fees and milestone payments from collaborative partners  operating and capital lease financings  interest earned on investments and limited license fees and royalties from licensing intellectual property 
since inception  we have incurred net losses and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years in order to complete the development and commercialization of hematide 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 

table of contents in march  we completed a private placement raising an estimated million of net proceeds through the issuance of common stock and warrants exercisable for common stock 
we believe that the existing cash  cash equivalents and investments together with the interest thereon  will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations through at least months 
however  we expect that we will need to raise additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of hematide 
the current worldwide capital markets have been extremely volatile  and biotechnology companies have been limited or unsuccessful in obtaining funding in this environment 
continuation of this market may significantly limit our ability to raise funds such that that there can be no assurance we can raise the additional funds to support our continuing operations and maintain current development timelines  and funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
further  we have had to reduce our research capabilities and efforts  including the elimination of certain research programs even some activities related to the support of hematide 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed we could be required to further delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing would be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
further  any strategic or licensing arrangements  if available  may require us to relinquish product rights that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of i expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and investigative sites  which conduct a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials  ii payments to contract manufacturing organizations  which produce our api  iii payments to consultants  iv license fees paid to third parties for use of their intellectual property  v employee related expenses  which include salaries and related costs  and vi facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
although we cannot predict the total amount our future research and development expenses with any degree of certainty  we expect to incur substantially increasing research and development expenses in  particularly expenses arising from clinical development activities including continuation of our phase clinical trials for hematide 
in addition  we may conduct more research and perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials to obtain additional data for hematide in future periods 
the table below sets out our research and development expenses excluding stock based compensation expenses by project since as a percentage of total research and development expenses for the applicable period 
we commence tracking the costs for a project when we are working with another company or when the related prototype peptide demonstrates significant biological activity  typically in a cell free assay  and merits substantial increase in the level of effort 
hematide other research programs total does not include any projects where the expense is or greater of total research and development expenses excluding stock based compensation expense 

table of contents under the worldwide agreement with takeda  we and takeda will co develop and co commercialize hematide in the us beginning january   takeda was responsible for the first million of third party expenses related to development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of hematide 
of the first million of third party expenses related to the development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of hematide to be borne by takeda  a total of million was utilized by both parties through december  and the remainder was utilized during the first quarter of thereafter  takeda bears of the third party us development expenses  while we are responsible for of the expenses 
we retain responsibility for of our internal development expenses 
takeda will have primary responsibility and bear all costs for hematide clinical development in support of regulatory approval for all territories outside the us the process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain food and drug administration  or fda approval is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate s early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on developing hematide  in the future we may develop additional product candidates internally and in license product candidates  which will increase our research and development expenses in later periods 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business and commercial development  information technology  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  patent filing  prosecution and defense costs and professional fees for legal  consulting  auditing and tax services 
we expect to incur increasing general and administrative expense in future periods to support our research and development activities  preparation for the new drug application for hematide  costs associated with our j j litigation and development of commercial capabilities 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition collaboration revenue we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
application of this standard requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
in february and june  we entered into two separate collaboration agreements with takeda  or the arrangement  which have been combined for accounting purposes due to their proximity of negotiation 
we evaluated the multiple elements under the combined single arrangement in accordance with the provisions of eitf we determined the deliverables do not have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and we were unable to obtain verifiable objective evidence to determine the fair value of the undelivered elements 
accordingly  we concluded that there was a single unit of accounting 
effective january   we entered into an amendment to the arrangement with takeda 
the amendment provides us the ability to opt out of our obligation to participate on the joint steering committee and any related subcommittees at any time beginning january  without any other modifications 
as a result  the obligation to participate in the joint steering committee and any related subcommittee is no longer indefinite 
accordingly  we determined that we can separate the performance obligations that occur over the development period from the performance obligations that will occur during the commercialization period 
we do not expect the development period obligations to extend past january  as a result of the change in performance period from indefinite to approximately years ie  the inception of the arrangement to january   beginning on january   we recognized revenue during the development period using the contingency adjusted performance model capm 
under the capm  revenue is initially recognized in the period the payment is earned under the arrangement including amounts that are either received or due from takeda 
revenue initially recognized is based on the percentage of time elapsed from inception of the arrangement in june to the period in which the payment is earned in relation to the total projected development period 
the remaining portion of the payment is then recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated duration of the development period of the arrangement 
payments during the development period include amounts due for upfront license fees  milestone payments earned  purchases of api and reimbursement of development and commercial expenses 
the cumulative effect adjustment totaling million for the change of estimate  which results from now being able to estimate the period of performance  was recognized as additional revenue during the three months ended march  through the period of the joint steering committee obligation  we expect collaboration revenue to be directly affected by milestone payments and expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from takeda under the arrangement in future periods 
included in the reimbursable expense is the cost of api that we manufacture and supply to takeda during the development period  which we will also supply during the commercialization period 
a change in the estimated term of the development period could materially affect the amount of collaboration revenue recognized in future periods 
prior to january  we were unable to determine the period of its performance obligations under the arrangement as our required participation on the joint steering committee extends for as long as products subject to the collaboration with takeda are being sold by either of the parties 
accordingly  the contractual term of our joint steering committee obligations was considered indefinite 

table of contents as a result  revenue for the single unit of accounting was recorded on a proportional performance basis as long as the overall arrangement was determined to be profitable during the years ended december  and we accounted for the arrangement using a zero profit proportional performance model ie  revenue was recognized equal to direct costs incurred  but not in excess of cash received or receivable assuming that the overall arrangement was expected to be profitable 
we used an input based measure  specifically direct costs  to determine proportional performance because we believed that the inputs were representative of the value being conveyed to takeda through the research and development activities and delivery of the api 
we believed that using direct costs as the unit of measure of proportional performance also most closely reflected the level of effort related to our performance under the arrangement 
direct costs were those costs that directly resulted in the culmination of an earnings process for which takeda received a direct benefit 
the nature of these costs were third party and internal costs associated with conducting clinical trial activities for dialysis and pre dialysis indications  costs associated with the manufacturing of api and api stability testing  allocated payroll related costs for representatives participating on the joint steering committee and sales and marketing costs during the co commercialization period 
direct costs specifically excluded costs of a general and administrative nature  upfront payments to manufacturers unrelated to specific product manufactured such as reservation of capacity  cost for api not yet delivered to takeda  travel and expense related costs  sales and marketing costs during the development period  any research and development costs not associated with hematide  interest  depreciation and amortization expense 
revenue was recognized equal to direct costs incurred  but not in excess of cash received or receivable 
amounts resulting from payments received in advance of revenue recognized were recorded as deferred revenue until the earlier of i when we could meet the criteria for separate recognition of each element under the guidance of eitf or ii after we had fulfilled all of its contractual obligations under the arrangement 
we were required to assess the profitability of the overall arrangement on a periodic basis throughout the life of the arrangement when events or circumstances indicated a potential change in facts 
profitability was defined as a net cash inflow resulting from the arrangement over its life 
such assessment was based on estimates to determine the most likely outcome based on available facts and circumstances at each assessment date 
the estimates included the consideration of factors such as the progress and timing of clinical trials  competitive esas in the market  drug related serious adverse events and other safety issues in the clinical trials  pricing reimbursement in relevant markets and historical costs incurred compared to original estimates 
when the periodic assessment or other events or circumstances indicated a loss would result from performance under the arrangement  costs would continue to be recognized as they were incurred 
however  revenue would be deferred until either i the arrangement became profitable  at which point revenue would continue to be recognized  or ii the end of the arrangement 
license and royalty revenue royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms  when third party results are reported and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalties received under agreements that were acquired by the company in the spin out from glaxosmithkline glaxo are recorded net of the that the company is required to remit to glaxo 
clinical trial expense we record expense for estimated clinical study external costs  which are a significant component of research and development r d expenses 
these clinical trial costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
clinical studies are administered by third party contract research organizations cros 
cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for the trials  including document preparation  site 
table of contents identification pre study visits  training as well as on going program management 
for the phase studies  which represent the vast majority of the clinical trial expense  the expense recorded is based on reporting received from cros and internal analyses 
we accrue costs for work performed by cros based on the achievement of contracted activities during the period 
expense for investigator fees  which include patient costs  is based on internal estimates of activities using patient enrollment and contractual or estimated rates 
for the phase studies  the expense is activities based such as patient monitoring as reported by the cros and achievement of milestones 
other costs such as testing and drug materials are expensed as incurred 
for all studies  cro reporting is reviewed by us for appropriateness and adjustments are made as deemed necessary to ensure that the expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the cros 
however  if we do not receive complete and accurate information from the vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time  we may have to record adjustments  including potentially significant additional r d expenses in subsequent periods 
during the quarter ended june   we identified an overstatement of clinical trial expense and collaboration revenue of million in the year ended december  as a result  clinical trial expense and collaboration revenue  which includes reimbursement for these costs  includes an out of period reduction of million and million  respectively  in the year ended december  stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no

 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
for stock options granted to nonemployees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we make assumptions with respect to the remaining contractual term of the option  the volatility of the fair value of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yields of our common stock 
different estimates  most notably volatility and expected term  of the option could materially change the value of an option and the resulting expense 
investments effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no

we adopted the provisions of sfas no

effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
we did not elect to adopt the fair value option under sfas no 
 except for the series c ars rights  as more fully described in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources 
our investments  other than auction rate securities  or ars  are classified within level or level of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets  broker quotations or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
our investments in ars are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because of the lack of observable inputs 
as a result  we determined the value of these ars at december  using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the analysis considers  among other things  the amount and timing of coupon payments  contractual terms  underlying collateralization  credit risk and an illiquidity discount factor 
the analysis considers that issuers have continued to meet interest payment obligations and are expected to continue to do so at levels consistent with issuer s credit risk 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  that prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin resulted in no adjustment to retained earnings as of january  we had million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and as of december  and  our fin liability for uncertain income tax positions was million and million  respectively  which was reflected as long term income tax liabilities on our balance sheet 
we adopted a policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of other expense and interest expense  respectively  as necessary 
for the year ended december   we recognized  of interest expense related to the million fin liability for uncertain income tax positions as of december  for the years ended december  and  no interest expense related to uncertain income tax positions was required or recognized 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of penalties related to uncertain income tax positions were required and recognized 
we do not anticipate that any of the unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly over the next twelve months

we recognized million of collaboration revenue under the capm for the year ended december   which included a million cumulative adjustment resulting from an amendment to the collaboration agreements with takeda  as discussed in the notes to our audited financial statements  and an out of period reduction of million 
collaboration revenue under capm includes expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from takeda  net of takeda s own eligible expenses 
we recognized million of collaboration revenue under the zero profit proportional performance model for the year ended december  the increase in collaboration revenue in  which we expect to continue through  was primarily due to the growth in third party development expenses reimbursed by takeda related to our phase clinical trials which commenced enrollment in late  and the continued amortization of revenue under the capm from expense reimbursements and milestones received from takeda in prior periods 
we recognized  and  of license and royalty revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in license and royalty revenue in was due to payments received under a license agreement that we acquired in the spin out from glaxo  net of the that we are required to remit to glaxo 
research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of million in clinical trial costs resulting principally from additional clinical trials  manufacturing of clinical supplies and enrollment of higher number of patients and an increase of million in personnel costs resulting from increased headcount and stock based compensation expenses 
we expect to incur substantially increasing research and development expenses in  particularly expenses arising from clinical development activities related to our phase clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of million in legal and consulting fees and an increase of approximately million in personnel costs resulting from higher headcount and stock based compensation expenses 
we expect to incur increasing general and administrative expenses in future periods to support our research and development activities  preparation for the new drug application for hematide  costs associated with our j j litigation and expansion of commercial capabilities 
interest income expense  net 
the decrease in interest income  net  was due primarily to lower level of cash  cash equivalents and investments and lower interest rates during the year 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  for the year ended december  includes a million other than temporary impairment charge related to the net decrease in fair value of our investments in ars partially offset by a million gain from the series c ars rights 
table of contents received from ubs ag  as more fully described in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources 
provision for income taxes 
we are subject to federal and california state income tax 
we recorded a provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes of  consisting of  of federal tax benefit and  of net california state income tax expense 
the  of federal tax benefit was primarily due to a research and development credits refund available to us pursuant to a provision within the housing assistance tax act of  which was signed into law in july the california state income tax expense of  was primarily related to an out of period reduction to our california research and development credits that was partially offset by additional california research and development credits that were identified 
we recorded a provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of million consisting of million of current income taxes net of a million of deferred tax benefit 
the current income taxes of million resulted primarily from the inclusion in taxable income of million of the upfront license fees received from takeda during that  for tax purposes  were deferred in and recognized in and resulted in us federal and state taxable income for the year ended december  the upfront license fees from takeda were recorded as deferred revenue for financial reporting purposes and are being recognized as revenue over a period of approximately years  as more fully described in the critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates section in this annual report on form k 
the million net deferred tax benefit  and the related net deferred tax asset as of december  in the same amount  were recorded to reflect our ability to carry back tax losses generated in and as a result of certain reversing tax deductible temporary differences from december  we intend to carry back our federal taxable loss to reduce our federal income tax liability to the alternative minimum income tax liability as determined under the current us federal income tax statutes 
we considered the following positive and negative factors in determining that it was more likely than not that the million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax asset as of december  and would be realized net deductible temporary differences that were expected to reverse in and and that we would generate losses in those years that could be carried back to reduce the federal income tax liability 
there were no relevant tax strategies available that we would consider feasible 
uncertainties  such as regulatory approval of hematide and binding arbitration and litigation with certain subsidiaries of johnson johnson  that if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect our future operations 
we have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future  and therefore the net deferred tax assets were limited to the amount available to be realized with the carry back enumerated above

we recognized million and million of revenue under our arrangement with takeda for the years ended december  and  respectively  under the zero profit proportional performance model  as discussed in the notes to our audited financial statements 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to the growth in direct costs associated with the increase in clinical trial activity and headcount in connection with hematide 
we recognized immaterial revenues for the years ended december  and from royalty payments 
research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses of million was primarily due to an increase of million in clinical trial costs resulting principally from additional clinical trials and enrollment of more patients  an increase of million in personnel costs resulting from increased headcount and stock based compensation expenses and a  technology license fee for which the technological feasibility had not been established and there is no alternative future use 
the increase in research and development expenses from the year ended december  to was lowered by a milestone payment of million in connection with the nektar license that was expensed during the year ended december  general and administrative expenses

our convertible preferred stock was redeemable at the request of the holders on or after july  we were accreting the carrying value of the preferred stock to the mandatory redemption amount using the effective interest method through periodic charges to additional paid in capital 
we recorded accretion on the preferred stock through the date of the automatic conversion of all of our outstanding preferred stock into common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering in december 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through sale of capital stock  license fees  milestone payments and reimbursement for development and commercial expenses and manufacturing costs from collaborative partners  operating and capital lease financing  interest earned on investments and limited license fees and royalties from licensing intellectual property 
from inception through december   we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and convertible preferred stock and million of upfront license fees  a million milestone payment and million for the reimbursement of development and commercial expenses and purchase of api from our collaboration agreements with takeda 
of the first million of third party expenses related to the development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of hematide to be borne by takeda under the arrangement  a total of million was utilized by both parties through december  and the remainder was utilized during the first quarter of thereafter  takeda bears of the third party us development expenses  while we are responsible for of the expenses 
as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies  corporate bonds  commercial paper  auction rate securities  or ars  and money market funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation 
as of december   we had fair value of ars totaling million that were comprised of municipal issuances that are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program  closed end preferred issuances and another municipal issuance 
the ars held by us are rated aaa by a major credit rating agency  except for one ars that is rated aa by a major credit rating agency 
ars are structured to provide liquidity by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  usually every days but have stated or contractual maturities that are generally greater than one year 
through mid february  every auction reset date of the ars held by us was successful 
in mid february  overall market liquidity concerns resulted in the failure of a majority of the auctions in the ars markets 
in the following month  approximately one fifth of the auctions for ars we held were successful 
however  the overall ars market has continued to deteriorate and the ars held by us have failed in all but a single auction since mid march during this period through december   the par value of ars held by us decreased by million to million primarily due to redemptions at par value by the issuers 
we determined the fair value of our ars at december  using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the analysis considers  among other things  the amount and timing of coupon payments  contractual terms  underlying collateralization and credit risk 
in addition  we included in our analysis an illiquidity factor to estimate the discount necessary to sell a security for which there is no active market 
the analysis considers that issuers have continued to meet interest payment obligations and are expected to continue to do so at levels consistent with issuer s credit risk 
our analysis resulted in a net decrease in fair value of ars totaling million as of december  the decrease in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary and recorded as an impairment charge to other expense for the year ended december  our analysis is based on dynamic market conditions and further deterioration in the ars markets or changes in our assumptions could lead to significant reductions in determined value thus resulting in impairments in future periods 
as a result of a settlement between various regulatory agencies  including the securities and exchange commission  and ubs entities relating to sales and marketing practices of ars  in october  we received an offer from ubs ag of series c ars rights in connection with the million of par value of ars that were purchased through ubs and we continue to hold through 
table of contents december  in november  we accepted the terms of the series c ars rights and delivered the required legal release of claims against the ubs entities 
the series c ars rights give us the option to require ubs to repurchase  at par  the ars beginning on june   and prior to such date  ubs has the option to buy  at par  the ars 
in connection with the ars rights  ubs is also making available to eligible borrowers  loans potentially up to of the value of the ars 
we determined that the ars rights do not meet the definition of a derivative security under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 because the ars rights are non transferable and we must tender the related ars to receive the cash settlement 
therefore  we elected to measure the ars rights separately under the fair value option of sfas no 
in order to partially offset the changes in the fair value of the related ars 
we determined the value of the ars rights was million as of december  using a discounted cash flow analysis based on  among other things  the timing and likelihood of the recovery of the par value of the ars from ubs 
we recorded the fair value of the ars rights as a long term other asset with a corresponding credit to other income expense  partially offsetting the unrecognized losses incurred to date on the related ars  during the year ended december  the recognition of the ars rights and the other than temporary impairment on the related ars resulted in a net impact of  to other income expense for the year ended december  we anticipate that future changes in the fair value of the ars rights will be offset by the changes in the fair value of related ars with no material net impact to net loss 
based on our expected cash usage and our balance of cash and other investments  we do not anticipate the current illiquidity of these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual for at least months 
however  there can be no assurance as to the timing of when  or if the market for ars will recover in a manner that will allow us to receive a return of some or all of our principal or to meet our liquidity needs 
although our ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  if the illiquidity continues  these investments may be subject to a further decline in value  which would require us to recognize additional impairments in future periods 
we may also be required to sell these investments at prices significantly below par or assessed fair value 
if we are unable to liquidate our ars to obtain funds when needed we may be unable to fund our operations 
ubs ag may not be able to maintain the financial resources necessary to satisfy its obligations with respect to the ars rights in a timely manner or at all

in april  we entered into a license  manufacturing and supply agreement with nektar therapeutics al  corporation  or nektar  under which we obtained from nektar a worldwide  non exclusive license  with limited rights to grant sublicenses  to certain intellectual property covering pegylation technology to manufacture  develop and commercialize hematide 
in consideration of the license grant  we agreed to pay royalties on the sales of hematide 
we also agreed to pay milestone payments totaling up to million  plus possible additional milestones in connection with our partnering activities relating to hematide or merger and acquisition activities 
in july  we paid 
table of contents nektar a million milestone payment triggered by the collaboration agreements signed with takeda in february and june under the agreement  we also engaged nektar for the manufacture and supply of our requirements of bulk poly ethylene glycol reagent for the manufacture of hematide 
this relationship is managed by a managing committee formed by representatives from both us and nektar 
nektar is obligated to engage a third party manufacturer in the event of nektar s failure as defined in the agreement to supply reagent 
this agreement expires  on a country by country basis  upon the expiration of our royalty payment obligations 
the agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party s material breach provided that such other party has been given a chance to cure such breach  or by nektar for our challenge of the validity or enforceability of any patents licensed thereunder 
in september  we entered into an operating lease for additional office space in palo alto  california 
the lease commenced in november and terminates in december the total square footage covered by the new lease is  square feet  of which we leased  square feet starting in november and the remaining  square feet starting in september in december  we entered into an extension of the operating lease for office space in palo alto  california 
the lease extension commences in october and terminates in september the total square footage covered by the lease extension is  square feet  of which we lease  square feet starting in october and the remaining  square feet starting in january our future capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors and are not limited to the following the initiation  progress  timing and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for hematide  our ability to maintain and achieve milestones under our collaboration agreements with takeda  costs of litigation  outcome  timing and cost of regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements  the number of drug candidates that we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims  timing and terms of future in licensing and out licensing transactions  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  cost of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of hematide and future product candidates  if any  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
in march  we completed a private placement raising an estimated million of net proceeds through the issuance of common stock and warrants exercisable for common stock 
we believe that the existing cash  cash equivalents and investments together with the interest thereon  will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations through at least months 
however  we expect that we will need to raise additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of hematide even after taking into account the potential milestone payments that may be received under our collaboration with takeda 
the current worldwide capital markets have been extremely volatile and 
table of contents inaccessible  and biotechnology companies have been limited or unsuccessful in obtaining funding in this environment 
securing funding has been particularly difficult for small companies of our size with limited capital resources 
continuation of this market may significantly limit our ability to raise funds such that that there can be no assurance we can raise the additional funds to support our continuing operations and maintain current development timelines  and funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
hematide is the main focus of our business  which we expect to be the case for the foreseeable future 
further  we have had to reduce our research capabilities and efforts  including the elimination of certain research programs even some activities related to support of hematide 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed we could be required to further delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
further  any strategic or licensing arrangements  if available  may require us to relinquish product rights that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf no 
 which defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting and disclosure requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangements and third parties 
eitf no 
is effective retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of eitf no 
will have on our financial statements 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf no 

eitf no 
requires us to defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities 
such amounts will be recognized as expenses as the goods are delivered or the services are performed 
if we do not expect the goods to be delivered or the services to be performed  the capitalized amounts should be expensed 
the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf no 

eitf no 
provides guidance on how to determine if certain instruments or embedded features are considered indexed to our own stock  including instruments similar to our issued warrants to purchase our stock 
eitf no 
requires companies to use a two step approach to evaluate an instrument s contingent exercise provisions and settlement provisions in determining whether the instrument is considered to be indexed to its own stock and exempt from the application of sfas no 
although eitf no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   any outstanding instrument at the date of adoption will require a retrospective application of the accounting through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption 
we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of eitf no 
will have on our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements there were no significant off balance sheet arrangements at december

quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risks interest rate risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we do not believe that a decrease in interest rates would have a material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had fair value of ars totaling million that were comprised of municipal issuances that are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program  closed end preferred issuances and another municipal issuance 
the ars held by us are rated aaa by a major credit rating agency  except for one ars that is rated aa by a major credit rating agency 
based on overall market liquidity concerns  we determined that there was a net decrease in fair value of ars totaling million as of december  the table below presents the weighted average interest rates and related carrying amounts of our investment portfolio as of december  and weighted average interest rate carrying amount weighted average interest rate carrying amount in thousands in thousands cash equivalents short term investments long term investments foreign exchange risk we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies  and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
at each quarter end  we may have liabilities for costs incurred by overseas suppliers of goods or services and clinical trial programs that are denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged because of their relatively small size  uncertainty of payment date  and or short time until settlement 
an increase or decrease in exchange rates on these unhedged exposures may affect our operating results
