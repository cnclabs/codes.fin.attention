item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
the industry at approximately trillion in annual sales  automotive retailing is the largest retail trade sector in the us and has historically comprised roughly of the gdp 
new vehicles are sold through more than  automotive retail stores franchised by automotive manufacturers 
these franchise stores have designated trade territories under state franchise law protection  which limits the number of new stores for any one brand that can be opened in any given area 
new vehicle sales are highly fragmented with the largest automotive retailers generating less than of total industry revenues 
in addition to these new vehicle outlets  used vehicles are sold by approximately  independent used vehicle dealers and through private person to person transactions 
unlike many other retailing segments  automotive manufacturers provide unparalleled support to the automotive retailer 
manufacturers often bear the burden of markdown risks on slow moving inventory as they provide aggressive dealer and customer incentives to clear aged inventory in order to free the inventory pipeline for new purchases 
in addition  an automotive retailer s cash investment in new vehicle inventory is relatively small  given floorplan financing from manufacturers captive finance companies or bank lenders 
manufacturer captives have historically provided financing for working capital and acquisitions and loans to consumers to finance vehicle purchases 
in addition  the manufacturers pay market rate prices to their dealers for servicing vehicles under manufacturers warranties 
automotive retailers have much lower fixed overhead costs than automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers 
variable and discretionary costs  such as sales commissions and personnel  advertising and inventory finance expenses  can be adjusted to more closely match vehicle sales 
variable and discretionary costs account for an estimated of the retail industry s total expenses 
moreover  an automotive retailer can enhance its profitability from sales of higher margin products and services 
gross profit margins for the parts and service business are approximately 
gross profit margins for finance and insurance are virtually as they are fee driven income items 
these supplemental  high margin 
table of contents products and services provide substantial incremental revenue  decreasing reliance on the highly competitive new vehicle sales component 
was an unprecedented year of change in the industry 
us new vehicle sales were million units in compared to million units in and the trend during the year was even weaker as the year progressed 
early trends in indicate a continuation of the weak sales environment 
we expect that manufacturers will continue to offer incentives on new vehicle sales during through a combination of repricing strategies  rebates  lease programs  early lease cancellation programs and low interest rate loans to consumers 
dealerships are expected to close or consolidate at a greater rate in than has been seen historically 
given the large capital requirements necessary to operate a dealership  a more challenging retail environment  and more intense dealer competition the automotive retail industry is experiencing financial strain 
additionally  wholesale credit lines required to finance new vehicle inventories have become more expensive  been limited in overall size  and in extreme cases  have been terminated 
domestic manufacturers are under pressure to reduce their dealer networks for strategic reasons  which will likely be accomplished through natural attrition 
a significant number of dealerships closed in  with the expectation for more to close in new vehicle sales usually decline during a weak economy  however  the higher margin service and parts businesses typically benefit  because consumers tend to keep their vehicles longer 
automotive retailers benefit from their designation as an exclusive warranty and recall service provider of a manufacturer 
for the typical manufacturer s warranty  this provides an automotive retailer with a period of at least years of repeat business for service covered by warranty 
extended warranties can add two or more years to this repeat servicing period 
profitability of automotive retailers will vary and depends in part on local economic conditions  local competition and product mix  effective management of inventory  marketing  quality control and responsiveness to customers 
in the industry  new vehicles sales typically account for an estimated of a store s revenues  used vehicles sales typically account for approximately of revenues and the remaining is typically derived from service and parts sales 
in a recessionary environment  those revenue percentages typically trend higher toward service and parts  and lower toward new and used sales as customers are more inclined to service the vehicle they have 
finance and insurance sales are included in the new and used vehicle sales numbers 
industry gross profit margins were in our gross profit margin was and in and  respectively 
the macroeconomic challenges the country faces today are expected to continue through most  if not all of constrained credit markets  gas price fluctuations  falling home equity and stock prices  and low consumer confidence  are all significant factors taken into account when looking forward in the industry 
conversely  tighter cost structures  a smaller dealer base  and the scrappage of vehicles due to age and usage are all factors that will have a positive effect on the industry upon the recovery of the broader economy 
store operations our store operations are supported by centralized inventory control  centralized processing of administrative and office functions and centralized marketing 
this allows our store management personnel to concentrate on customer and employee satisfaction 
during  we improved functionality of our centralized vehicle inventory control  pricing and procurement process  implemented it initiatives related to centralizing back office car deal processing  implemented cost cutting initiatives in our stores reducing staffing and other expenses  
table of contents realigned operations and created a flatter organization to improve communication and accountability 
the following tables set forth information about our stores that were part of operations as of december  state number of stores percent of annualized revenue oregon texas california washington alaska iowa idaho colorado montana nevada north dakota nebraska new mexico total at december   we had stores held for sale as part of discontinued operations  three of which were disposed of in the first quarter of we also disposed of an additional store in march that was not part of discontinued operations

table of contents our unit and dollar sales of new vehicles from continuing operations were as follows year ended december  new car units new car sales in thousands average selling price new truck units new truck sales in thousands average selling price total new vehicle units total new vehicle sales in thousands average selling price truck units include trucks  light trucks  vans  suvs and crossovers 
as discussed above  new vehicle unit sales were negatively affected by the declining economic conditions and reduced showroom traffic in our stores throughout we purchase our new car inventory directly from manufacturers  who generally allocate new vehicles to stores based on availability  the number of vehicles sold by the store on a monthly basis and by the store s market area 
accordingly  we rely on the manufacturers to provide us with vehicles that consumers desire and to supply us with such vehicles at suitable locations  quantities and prices 
however  high demand vehicles often are in short supply 
we attempt to exchange vehicles with other automotive retailers and amongst our own stores to accommodate customer demand and to balance inventory 
used vehicle sales at each new vehicle store  we also sell used vehicles  which are significant contributors to our gross profit 
in  retail used vehicle sales generated a gross profit margin of compared to a gross profit margin of for new vehicle sales 
as part of our restructuring plan in  our investment in our used vehicle l locations was placed on hold and certain development personnel were terminated as we were unwilling to continue to absorb the expected startup losses 
since the beginning of  the used vehicle market has been negatively impacted by strong competition from the new vehicle market 
however  in  a shift towards used vehicle retail sales was experienced due to primarily to three factors 
first  the incentives that have become a mainstay of new vehicle sales were reduced 
second  due to the reduction in available credit  fewer customers qualified for new vehicle financing  or the total amount they could finance was reduced  which shifted demand towards used vehicles which have a lower transaction price and associated monthly payment 
finally  lower consumer confidence made customers less willing to make a larger investment through a new vehicle purchase 
in spite of the shift towards used vehicles sales  the challenging retail environment nonetheless led to a decline in same store used vehicle combined retail and wholesale sales of in compared to the following policies and procedures are utilized for our used vehicle sales most used vehicles are sold with a sixty day  mile bumper to bumper warranty 
we are piloting as is vehicles in certain facilities to maximize incremental retail opportunities 

table of contents in addition  as a complement to our ongoing used vehicle operation at each store  we use personnel in our support services group to identify and acquire a better mix of used vehicles desired by the customer 
we conduct our own closed used vehicle auctions in select markets and manage the disposal of used vehicles at larger auctions 
the process is centralized and controlled at the corporate level 
during  we implemented a centralized appraisal and redistribution center to help set the purchase and sales price of our used vehicles and to direct delivery to the appropriate retail location 
this center provides analytical and market information to assist the store personnel in making decisions 
we redistribute cars between lithia locations based on inventory needs 
centralizing and distributing used vehicle inventories allows customers access to a greater pool of vehicles 
our used vehicle operations give us an opportunity to generate sales to customers financially unable or unwilling to purchase a new vehicle  increase new and used vehicle sales by aggressively pursuing customer trade ins  and increase service contract sales and provide financing to used vehicle purchasers 
in  we sold approximately retail used vehicles for every retail new vehicle sold  compared to approximately retail used vehicles for every new vehicle sold in our longer term strategy is to achieve a ratio of in the current year  the improvement in this ratio is primarily due to sharply declining new vehicle sales and a shift in demand for used vehicles 
we acquire most of our used vehicles through customer trade ins  but we also buy them at closed auctions  attended only by new vehicle automotive retailers with franchises for the brands offered 
these auctions offer off lease  rental and fleet vehicles 
we also buy used vehicles at traditional dealer only auctions 
in addition to selling used vehicles to retail customers  we wholesale used vehicles that are in poor condition  are aged in our inventory or are not suitable for our brand mix 
our used vehicle sales from continuing operations were as follows year ended december  retail used vehicle units retail used vehicle sales in thousands average selling price wholesale used vehicle units wholesale used vehicle sales in thousands average selling price total used vehicle units total used vehicle sales in thousands average selling price vehicle financing we believe that arranging financing is critical to our ability to sell vehicles and related products and services 
our sales personnel and finance and insurance managers possess extensive knowledge of available financing alternatives and receive training in securing customer financing 
we try to arrange financing for every vehicle we sell and offering customer financing on a same day basis gives us an advantage  particularly over smaller competitors who do not generate enough sales to attract our breadth of finance sources 

table of contents the tightening of the credit markets experienced in reduced the number of loans originated  restricted loans to more credit worthy customers  reduced vehicle leasing programs and increased the overall cost of financing 
the manufacturers captive financing companies have suffered additional pressure as the financial crisis has raised their cost of funds and reduced their access to capital  which has prevented them from offering as many incentives designed to drive sales and the level of loan to value they are willing to finance on vehicles 
despite these negative factors  we were still able to arrange financing on of our vehicles sold during the fourth quarter of but on a significantly lower volume of sales 
changes in technology surrounding the credit application process have allowed us to tap a larger network of lenders across broader geographic areas 
additionally  some of the smaller  local banks and credit unions are picking up where some of the larger financial institutions have cut back 
we earn a portion of the financing charge by discounting each finance contract we write and subsequently sell to a lender 
we normally arrange financing for customers by selling the contracts to outside sources on a non recourse basis to avoid the risk of default 
during  we did not directly finance any of our vehicle sales 
service contracts and other products our finance and insurance managers also market third party extended warranty contracts and insurance contracts to our new and used vehicle buyers 
these products and services yield higher profit margins than vehicle sales and contribute significantly to our profitability 
extended warranty contracts provide additional coverage for new vehicles beyond the duration or scope of the manufacturer s warranty 
the service contracts we sell to used vehicle buyers provide coverage for certain major repairs 
we believe the sale of extended warranty and service contracts increases our service and parts business as well 
we also offer our customers gap coverage when they finance an automobile purchase to cover any loss the customer might otherwise incur based upon a difference in the amount owed and the proceeds received under a comprehensive insurance claim 
we receive a commission on each policy sold 
service  body and parts our service  body and parts operations are an integral part of establishing customer loyalty and contribute significantly to our overall revenue and profits 
we provide parts and service primarily for the new vehicle brands sold by our stores  but we also service other vehicles 
in  our service  body and parts operations generated million  or of total revenues 
our service  body and parts business was less affected by the challenging economic environment in than our other business lines 
this reflects the counter cyclicality of this segment of our business 
for all service work we perform  we provide a three year   mile warranty  including parts and labor  and a guaranteed price based on the estimate given at the time the service order is written 
the service and parts business provides important repeat revenues to the stores 
we market our parts and service products by notifying the owners of vehicles when their vehicles are due for periodic service 
this encourages preventive maintenance rather than post breakdown repairs 
we offer a lifetime oil and filter service  which  in  was purchased by of our new and used vehicle buyers 
this service helps us retain customers and provides opportunities for repeat parts and service business 
revenues from the service  body and parts departments are particularly important during economic downturns as owners tend to repair their existing used vehicles rather than buy new vehicles during such periods 
this mitigates some of the effects of a drop in new vehicle sales that may occur in recessionary economic environment 

table of contents we operate fifteen collision repair centers four in texas  two each in oregon and idaho  and one each in alaska  washington  montana  colorado  nevada  nebraska and iowa 
marketing we market ourselves as lithia auto stores serving our communities since in most markets our stores are identified as lithia auto stores  except where prohibited by franchise requirements 
our fixed operations provides us an opportunity to build the lithia automotive brand regardless of new vehicle franchise 
in early  we began branding our service processes as assured service 
assured service provides superior customer benefits like same day service  upfront price guarantees  and a three year  mile warranty on repairs 
we have also launched assured automotive products  which provide a higher margin on various commodity items such as tires  filters and batteries 
we emphasize customer satisfaction and we realize that customer retention is critical to our success 
through a combination of lithia owner marketing utilizing direct mail and email and customer concern resolution we aim to have customers that refer us to the their families and friends 
to increase consideration and shopping at our stores we employ all the traditional advertising media including television  newspaper  radio  direct mail  and web sites 
advertising expense  net of manufacturer credits  was million during  with of the total amount used for print media  for television  for radio  for internet and for direct mail and other sources 
all of our advertising messages seek to differentiate us from our competitors based on pricing  selection and available financing options 
some of our advertising and marketing expenditures are offset by manufacturer co op programs 
our stores also receive marketing support by our membership in various advertising cooperatives and associations  whose members pool their resources and expertise with manufacturers to advertise collectively 
in addition  by owning a cluster of stores in a particular market  we are able to advertise as a group realizing savings through volume discounts and the efficiencies of shared media 
the role of the internet in automotive retail marketing continues to grow 
most people now shop online before visiting our stores 
we maintain websites for all of our stores and a corporate site www 
lithia 
com dedicated to generating customer leads for our stores 
today  our web site enables a customer to locate our stores and identify the new vehicle brands sold at each store  view new and used vehicle inventory  including current special pricing conduct a live chat for customer assistance submit a credit application schedule service appointments  obtain kelley blue book values  visit our investor relations site  and view employment opportunities 
we are very active in search engine optimization  search engine marketing  and behavioral targeting of online advertising to generate traffic to our websites 
we also have a number of mobile website pilots underway as this new platform provides increased convenience to our customers and employees 
management information system we consolidate  process and maintain financial information  operational and accounting data  and other related statistical information on centralized computers 
we have a fully operational intranet with each store directly connected to headquarters 
our systems are based on an adp platform for the main 
table of contents database  and information is processed and analyzed utilizing customized financial reporting software from oracle corporation 
senior management can access detailed information from all of our locations regarding inventory  cash balances  total unit sales and mix of new and used vehicle sales  lease and finance transactions  sales of ancillary products and services  key cost items and profit margins  and the relative performance of the stores 
each store s general manager has access to this same information 
with this information  we can quickly analyze the results of operations  identify trends and focus on areas that require attention or improvement 
our management information system also allows our general managers to respond quickly to changes in consumer preferences and purchasing patterns  maximizing our inventory turnover 
our management information system is particularly important to successfully operating acquired stores 
following each acquisition  we immediately install our management information system at each location 
this quickly makes financial  accounting and other operational data easily available throughout the company 
with this information  we can more efficiently execute our operating strategy at each new store 
franchise agreements each of our lithia store subsidiaries operates under a separate franchise agreement with each manufacturer of the new vehicles it sells 
the typical automobile franchise agreement specifies the locations within a designated market area at which the store may sell vehicles and related products and perform certain approved services 
the designation of such areas and the allocation of new vehicles among stores are at the discretion of the manufacturer 
franchise agreements do not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory  but do have some protection under state laws 
a franchise agreement may impose requirements on the store with respect to facilities and equipment  inventories of vehicles and parts  minimum working capital  training of personnel  and performance standards for market share and customer satisfaction 
each manufacturer closely monitors compliance with these requirements and requires each store to submit monthly financial statements 
franchise agreements also grant a store the right to use and display manufacturers trademarks  service marks and designs in the manner approved by each manufacturer 
most franchise agreements are generally renewed after one to five years  and  in practice  have indefinite lives 
some franchise agreements  including those with chrysler  have no termination date 
historically  all of our agreements have been renewed 
in addition  state franchise laws protect franchised automotive retailers 
under certain of those laws  a manufacturer may not terminate or fail to renew a franchise without good cause  or prevent any reasonable changes in the capital structure or financing of a store 
the typical franchise agreement provides for early termination or non renewal by the manufacturer upon a change of management or ownership without manufacturer consent  
table of contents insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealer  death or incapacity of the dealer manager  conviction of a dealer manager or owner of certain crimes  misrepresentation of certain sales or inventory information by the store  dealer manager or owner to the manufacturer  failure to adequately operate the store  failure to maintain any license  permit or authorization required for the conduct of business  or poor market share or low customer satisfaction index scores 
agreements generally provide for prior written notice before a franchise can be terminated under most circumstances 
we also sign master framework agreements with most manufacturers that impose additional requirements on our stores 
see item a 
risk factors 
in the event of a manufacturer bankruptcy filing  any franchise agreement could be unilaterally rejected by the manufacturer as part of their plan to reorganize 
however  if the agreement was not rejected but was assumed in a confirmed plan  it could continue with the same rights and conditions that existed prior to the filing 
in the event of a chapter bankruptcy filing by a manufacturer  several factors should be considered 
first  franchise points represent a low cost distribution network for the manufacturer and it is the automotive dealer that purchases their vehicles for resale to the consumer 
therefore  terminating franchises reduces the number of outlets selling vehicles to the public and is counter to the broader objective of keeping factories in operation emerging from reorganization 
second  the majority of our franchises are in single point locations  meaning there are not multiple franchises in the same market area 
these locations are the only distribution point in the area  and we believe the manufacturers would endeavor to keep their products widely available to the general public 
however  we operate certain facilities in locations with competing operators holding the same franchise rights in the area or nearby including five stores with three or more dealers of the same brand in the market 
further  should a manufacturer in bankruptcy elect to cease producing certain brands  related franchises would be expected to be terminated 
no assurances can be given that our franchise rights would not be terminated in a manufacturer bankruptcy filing 
competition the retail automotive business is highly competitive  consisting of a large number of independent operators  many of whom are individuals  families and small retail groups 
we compete primarily with other automotive retailers  both public and privately held 
vehicle manufacturers have designated specific marketing and sales areas within which only one dealer of a vehicle brand may operate 
in addition  our franchise agreements typically limit our ability to acquire multiple dealerships of a given brand within a particular market area 
certain state franchise laws also restrict us from relocating our dealerships or establishing new dealerships of a particular brand within any area that is served by another dealer with the same brand 
accordingly  to the extent that a market has multiple dealers of a particular brand  as some of our markets do  we are subject to significant intra brand competition 
we are larger and have more financial resources than most private automotive retailers with which we currently compete in most of our regional markets 
we compete directly with retailers like ourselves in our metropolitan markets in denver  colorado  seattle  washington and concord  california 
if we enter other metropolitan markets  we may face competitors that are larger or have access to greater financial resources 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers 
we rely on advertising and merchandising  pricing  our customer guarantees and sales model  our sales expertise  service reputation and location of our stores to sell new vehicles 

table of contents regulation automotive and other laws and regulations we operate in a highly regulated industry 
a number of state and federal laws and regulations affect our business 
in every state in which we operate  we must obtain various licenses in order to operate our businesses  including dealer  sales and finance and insurance licenses issued by state regulatory authorities 
numerous laws and regulations govern our conduct of business  including those relating to our sales  operations  financing  insurance  advertising and employment practices 
these laws and regulations include state franchise laws and regulations  consumer protection laws  privacy laws  escheatment laws  anti money laundering laws and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers  as well as a variety of other laws and regulations 
these laws also include federal and state wage hour  anti discrimination and other employment practices laws 
our financing activities with customers are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations 
claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or our stores by individuals  a class of individuals  or governmental entities 
these claims may expose us to significant damages or other penalties  including revocation or suspension of our licenses to conduct store operations and fines 
our operations are subject to the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act  federal motor vehicle safety standards promulgated by the united states department of transportation  and the rules and regulations of various state motor vehicle regulatory agencies 
environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations our operations involve the use  handling  storage and contracting for recycling and or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters  transmission fluids  antifreeze  refrigerants  paints  thinners  batteries  cleaning products  lubricants  degreasing agents  tires and fuel 
consequently  our business is subject to a complex variety of federal  state and local requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety 
most of our stores utilize aboveground storage tanks  and  to a lesser extent  underground storage tanks  primarily for petroleum based products 
storage tanks are subject to periodic testing  containment  upgrading and removal under the resource conservation and recovery act and its state law counterparts 
clean up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from storage tanks or other sources 
in addition  water quality protection programs under the federal water pollution control act commonly known as the clean water act  the safe drinking water act and comparable state and local programs govern certain discharges from our operations 
similarly  certain air emissions from operations  such as auto body painting  may be subject to the federal clean air act and related state and local laws 
certain health and safety standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration of the united states department of labor and related state agencies also apply 
some of our stores are parties to proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla  typically in connection with materials that were sent to former recycling  treatment and or disposal facilities owned and operated by independent businesses 
the remediation or clean up of facilities where the release of a regulated hazardous substance occurred is required under cercla and other laws 
we incur certain costs to comply with applicable environmental  health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business 
we do not anticipate  however  that the costs of such compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition  although such outcome is possible given the nature of our operations and the extensive environmental  
table of contents public health and safety regulatory framework 
we do not have any material known environmental commitments or contingencies 
however  no assurances can be given that material environmental commitments or contingencies will not arise in the future  or that they do not already exist but are unknown to us 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  persons on a full time equivalent basis 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
a majority of our new vehicles sales are from domestic brands 
a restructuring of operations by any of the three us manufacturers may have an adverse effect on our operations 
a cessation of operations and or liquidation or a material interruption in operations by any of the three us manufacturers would likely have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are subject to a concentration of risk in the event of financial distress  including potential bankruptcy  of a major vehicle manufacturer 
chrysler accounted for over  general motors accounted for and ford accounted for of our new vehicle sales in particularly with respect to the three domestic manufactures general motors  chrysler and ford  the current recession  volatile fuel prices and tightening credit markets have resulted in significantly lower vehicle sales and a deteriorating financial condition that could affect their ability to survive 
specifically  both general motors and chrysler have publicly announced that they have depleted their available cash resources and recently received loans from the federal government but in amounts announced to be inadequate to address their intermediate term cash needs 
the treasury has conditioned any further loans upon the presentation of a restructuring plan to reflect the ability of such manufacturer to stabilize its financial condition and survive in the increasingly competitive industry 
it is unknown at this time whether such funding will be made available or if provided  would be adequate to make them viable and competitive 
in a chapter reorganization in bankruptcy court the manufacturer could cease producing certain makes of vehicles and terminate all or any of our franchises even on continuing brands without consideration  we may not be able to collect some or all of our significant receivables that are due us from such manufacturer  we may not be able to obtain financing for our new vehicle inventory  or arrange financing for our customers for their vehicle purchases and leases and consumer demand for such manufacturer s products could be adversely affected 
if any of these events were to occur  our sales and earnings may be adversely impacted 
these events would also result in a partial or complete write down of our remaining intangible franchise rights with respect to any affected franchises and would likely cause us to incur valuation allowances related to receivables due from such manufacturers 
any associated franchise terminations would likely cause us to incur charges related to operating leases and or impairment of long lived assets 
additionally  there is a continued risk to both the new and used vehicle inventory valuations for the respective brand or manufacturer 
if the impact on us results in a material adverse change to our condition  covenants and cross default provisions in certain debt agreements may be triggered  resulting in the immediate demand for amounts outstanding under the agreements 
in a chapter liquidation in bankruptcy court  the manufacturer would seek protection from its creditors and would commence an orderly wind down of operations 
the impact of a liquidation would likely have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on our results from operations  cash flows and financial condition unless the operations were promptly sold to and assumed by another manufacturer 
a continuing recession and tight credit markets can be expected to reduce consumer demand for new and used vehicles 
in  automotive sales nationwide have dropped significantly 
while the sales reduction was felt mostly by the us domestic manufacturers  sales levels by nearly all manufacturers  including import and luxury brands  are down as well  some precipitously 
unless and until the economy  credit availability and consumer confidence improves  it is unlikely that sales will increase significantly  and they may be reduced further 
our success depends in large part upon the overall demand for the particular lines of vehicles that each of our stores sell and the ability of the manufacturers to continue to deliver such vehicles 
demand for our primary manufacturers vehicles as well as the financial condition  management  marketing  production and distribution capabilities of these manufacturers can significantly affect our business 
events that adversely affect a manufacturer s ability to timely deliver new vehicles may adversely affect us by reducing our supply of popular new vehicles and leading to lower sales in our stores during those periods than would otherwise occur 
in addition  vehicle manufacturers would be adversely impacted by economic downturns or recessions  adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  significant declines in the sales of their new vehicles  increases in interest rates  declines in their credit ratings  labor strikes or similar disruptions including within their major suppliers  supply shortages or rising raw material costs  rising employee benefit costs  adverse publicity that may reduce consumer demand for their products including due to bankruptcy  product defects  vehicle recall campaigns  litigation  poor product mix or unappealing vehicle design  or other adverse events 
these and other risks could materially adversely affect any manufacturer and limit its ability to profitably design  market  produce or distribute new vehicles  which  in turn  could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition  stockholders equity  cash flows and prospects 
additionally  federal and certain state s laws mandate minimum levels of vehicle fuel economy and establish emission standards which levels and standards could be increased in the future including the use of renewable energy sources 
such laws often increase the costs of new vehicles  generally  which would be expected to reduce demand 
further  changes in these laws could result in fewer vehicles available for sale by manufacturers unwilling or unable to comply with the higher standards 
as part of the restructuring currently underway by the domestic automakers  there could be a reduction in the makes or models associated with certain franchise agreements 
the cessation of any makes for which we hold a franchise would be expected to result in a termination of that franchise 
our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in our local markets  even if those conditions are not prominent nationally 
our performance is also subject to local economic  competitive and other conditions prevailing in our various geographic areas 
our dealerships currently are located in limited markets in states and the results of our operations therefore depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending levels in those markets 
in  our markets in oregon  california  nebraska and idaho were particularly slow  which exacerbated our sales declines 

table of contents the decline of available financing  particularly in the sub prime lending market and with captive financing companies  has adversely affected our sales of both new and used vehicles 
a significant portion of vehicle buyers finance their vehicle purchases 
sub prime finance companies have historically provided financing for consumers who  for a variety of reasons  including poor credit histories and lack of a down payment  do not have access to more traditional finance sources 
recent economic developments have significantly reduced credit availability even for more credit worthy buyers 
increasing minimum credit standards of the remaining sub prime lenders has severely reduced the ability of those consumers to purchase vehicles  which has and is expected to have a material adverse effect on our new and used vehicle sales  cash flows and profitability until these conditions abate 
we are dependent on manufacturer affiliated financing companies to provide flooring sources for our new vehicle inventories 
if flooring sources are eliminated  no assurances can be given that we will be able to secure additional borrowing facilities 
additionally  our flooring debt is due upon demand  and it may be called at any time 
we currently have relationships with a number of manufacturers or their affiliated finance companies including chrysler financial  mercedes financial  toyota motor credit corporation  ford motor credit company  general motors acceptance corporation llc  volkswagen credit  inc  american honda finance corporation and bmw financial services na  llc 
certain of these companies have indicated current financial constraints 
other companies may currently  or in the future  have additional financial uncertainty 
as a result  credit that has typically been extended to us by the companies may be modified with terms unacceptable to us or revoked entirely 
if these events were to occur  we may not be able to pay our flooring debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance the vehicles 
even if new financing were available  it may not be on terms acceptable to us 
our restructuring plan to reduce our operating losses  exposure to domestic brands  and level of debt has resulted in our placing numerous domestic stores in discontinued operations 
our ability to dispose of such stores without further losses is not assured 
the recent drop in new vehicle sales  particularly with respect to domestic brands  has resulted in an increased effort to reduce both the number and the percentage of our stores selling domestic brands 
further  the continuing challenges we have in successfully competing in metropolitan markets that are heavily concentrated with domestic stores  has resulted in our efforts to dispose of those stores as well 
currently  we have stores remaining in discontinued operations 
the uncertainty surrounding the strength or survivability of certain domestic manufacturers  the poor financial performance of most of the stores selected and the tight credit market for the few interested purchasers for those stores  may make it impossible to sell the remaining stores placed in discontinued operations and could result in further operating losses and or the closure of the stores 
if manufacturers discontinue or change sales incentives  warranties and other promotional programs  our results of operations  cash flows  or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we depend upon the manufacturers for sales incentives  warranties and other programs that are intended to promote new vehicle sales or support dealership profitability 
manufacturers historically have made many changes to their incentive programs during each year 
some of the key incentive programs include customer rebates  dealer incentives on new vehicles  special rates on certified  pre owned cars  below market financing on new vehicles and special leasing terms  warranties on new and used vehicles  and 
table of contents sponsorship of used vehicle sales by authorized new vehicle dealers 
a discontinuation or change in our manufacturers incentive programs could adversely affect our business 
recently  some manufacturers have tightened or eliminated certain financing incentives including leasing programs which have resulted in the loss of sales 
further  some manufacturers use a dealership s csi scores as a factor governing participation in incentive programs 
we may not meet such minimum scores  and as a consequence  may be precluded from receiving certain incentives 
volatility in vehicle fuel prices changes consumer demand and significant increases can be expected to reduce vehicle sales 
historically  in times of rapid increase in crude oil and fuel prices  sales of vehicles have dropped  particularly in the short term  as the economy slows  consumer confidence wanes and fuel costs become more prominent to the consumer s buying decision 
that condition existed in mid and was a significant contributor to reduced sales  particularly for less fuel efficient vehicles 
while gasoline prices significantly abated by year end  limited supply and an increasing demand over time is expected to result in significant price increases in the future 
in sustained periods of higher fuel costs  consumers who do purchase vehicles tend to prefer smaller  more fuel efficient vehicles or hybrid powered vehicles currently in limited supply 
the ability of our stores to make new vehicle sales depends in large part upon the manufacturers and  therefore  any disruption or change in our relationships with manufacturers may materially and adversely affect our profitability 
we depend on the manufacturers to provide us with a desirable mix of new vehicles 
the most popular vehicles usually produce the highest profit margins and are frequently in short supply 
if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of the most popular models  our profitability may be adversely affected 
sales of less desirable models may reduce our profit margins 
each of our stores operates pursuant to a franchise agreement with each of the respective manufacturers for which it serves as franchisee 
manufacturers exert significant control over our stores through the terms and conditions of their franchise agreements  including provisions for termination or non renewal for a variety of causes 
from time to time  certain of our stores have failed to comply with certain provisions of their franchise agreements 
these agreements and state law  however  generally afford us the opportunity to cure violations and no manufacturer has terminated or failed to renew any franchise agreement with us 
if a manufacturer terminates or fails to renew one or more of our significant franchise agreements  such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
our franchise agreements also specify that  in certain situations  we cannot operate a franchise by another manufacturer in the same building as the manufacturer s franchised store 
this may require us to build new facilities at a significant cost 
in addition  some manufacturers are in the process of realigning their stores along defined channels  such as combining chrysler and jeep in one location 
as a result  manufacturers may require us to move or sell certain stores 
moreover  our manufacturers generally require that the store meet defined image standards 
all of these commitments could require us to make significant capital expenditures 
some of our franchise agreements prohibit transfers of ownership interests of a store or  in some cases  its parent 
the most prohibitive restriction  which has been imposed by various manufacturers  provides that  under certain circumstances  we may lose a franchise if a person or entity acquires an ownership interest in us above a specified level ranging from to depending on the particular manufacturer s restrictions and falling as low as if another vehicle manufacturer is the entity acquiring the ownership interest without the approval of the applicable manufacturer 
violations by our stockholders or prospective stockholders are generally outside of our control and may result in the 
table of contents termination or non renewal of one or more of our franchises  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
import product restrictions and foreign trade risks may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles profitably 
certain vehicles we sell  as well as certain major components of vehicles we sell  are manufactured outside the united states 
accordingly  we are affected by import and export restrictions of various jurisdictions and are dependent to some extent on general economic conditions in  and political relations with  a number of foreign countries 
additionally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may increase the price and adversely affect our sales of vehicles produced by foreign manufacturers 
imports into the united states may also be adversely affected by increased transportation costs and tariffs  quotas or duties  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
environmental  health or safety regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  or financial condition or cause us to incur significant expenditures 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental  health and safety regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  handling  use  treatment  recycling  transportation  disposal and remediation of hazardous material and the emission and discharge of hazardous material into the environment 
under certain environmental regulations or pursuant to signed private contracts  we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our present or our previously owned facilities  and at third party waste disposal sites 
we are aware of contamination at certain of our facilities  and we are in the process of conducting investigations and or remediation at some of these properties 
in certain cases  the current or prior property owner is conducting the investigation and or remediation or we have been indemnified by either the current or prior property owner for such contamination 
there can be no assurances that these owners will remediate or continue to remediate these properties or pay or continue to pay pursuant to these indemnities 
we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations 
if we violate or fail to fully comply with these regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
environmental  health and safety regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent 
there can be no assurances that the costs of compliance with these regulations will not result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition or that additional environmental  health or safety matters will not arise or new conditions or facts will not develop in the future at our currently or formerly owned or operated facilities  or at sites that we may acquire in the future  which will require us to incur significant expenditures 
with the breadth of our operations and volume of transactions  compliance with the many federal and state laws and regulations cannot be assured 
new regulations are enacted on an ongoing basis 
these regulations can impact our profitability and require continued training and vigilance 
fines  judgments and administrative sanctions can be severe 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations in each of the states in which we have stores 
new laws and regulations are enacted on an ongoing basis 
with the number of stores we operate  the number of personnel we employ and the large volume of transactions we handle  it is likely that technical mistakes will be made 
it is also likely that these regulations may impact our profitability and require ongoing training 
current practices in stores may become prohibited 
we are responsible for ensuring that continued compliance with laws is maintained 
if there are unauthorized activities of serious magnitude  the state and federal authorities have the power to impose civil monetary penalties and sanctions  suspend or withdraw dealer licenses or take other actions 
these actions could materially impair our activities or our ability to acquire new stores in those states where violations occurred

table of contents private causes of action on behalf of individuals or a class of individuals could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief 
our ability to increase revenues through acquisitions depends on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate additional stores 
general 
while we are not currently purchasing new stores  when market conditions stabilize  our financial performance improves and funding is available  we would intend to again renew our growth strategy 
the us automobile industry is considered a mature industry in which minimal growth is expected in unit sales of new vehicles 
accordingly  a principal component of our growth in sales would be to make acquisitions in our existing markets and in new geographic markets 
to complete the acquisitions of additional stores  we need to successfully address each of the following challenges 
limitations on our capital resources may prevent us from capitalizing on acquisition opportunities 
acquisitions of additional stores will require substantial capital investment 
limitations on our capital resources would restrict our ability to complete new acquisitions 
we have financed our past acquisitions from a combination of the cash flow from our operations  borrowings under our credit arrangements  issuances of our common stock and proceeds from our private debt offering 
the use of any of these financing sources could have the effect of reducing our earnings per share 
manufacturers may restrict our ability to make new acquisitions 
we are required to obtain consent from the applicable manufacturer prior to the acquisition of a franchised store 
in determining whether to approve an acquisition  a manufacturer considers many factors  including our financial condition  ownership structure  the number of stores currently owned and our performance with those stores 
most major manufacturers have now established limitations or guidelines on the number of such manufacturers stores that may be acquired by a single owner  number of stores that may be acquired in any market or region  percentage of market share that may be controlled by one automotive retailer group  ownership of stores in contiguous markets  frequency of acquisitions  and requirement that no other manufacturers brands be sold from the same store location 
in addition  each manufacturer has site control agreements in place that limit our ability to change the use of the facility without their approval 
a manufacturer also considers our past performance as measured by their customer satisfaction index  or csi  scores and sales performance at our existing stores 
at any point in time  some of our stores may have csi scores below the manufacturers sales zone averages or have achieved sales performances below the targets manufacturers have set 
our failure to maintain satisfactory csi scores and to achieve market share performance goals could restrict our ability to complete future acquisitions 
we currently have  and at any point in the future may have  manufacturers that restrict our ability to complete future acquisitions 
competition with other automotive retailers for attractive acquisition targets could restrict our ability to complete new acquisitions 
in the current economic environment  we are presented with an increasing number of attractive acquisition opportunities 
however  when the economy improves  we would expect to compete with several other public and private national automotive retailers  some of which have greater financial and managerial resources 

table of contents indefinite lived intangible assets franchise value comprise a meaningful portion of our total assets million at december  
we must test our intangible assets for impairment at least annually  which may result in a further non cash write down of franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  shareholders equity and loan covenants 
indefinite lived intangibles are subject to impairment assessments at least annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred by applying a fair value based test 
our remaining principal intangible assets are our rights under our franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers 
the risk of impairment losses increases if operating losses are suffered at those stores  if a manufacturer files for bankruptcy or if the stores are closed 
impairment losses result in a non cash write down of the affected franchise values 
furthermore  impairment losses could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity 
a deferred tax asset position comprises a meaningful portion of our total assets approximately million at december  
we are required to assess the recoverability of this asset on an ongoing basis 
future negative operating performance or other negative evidence may result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of this amount 
this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  shareholder s equity and loan covenants 
deferred tax assets are evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if they are expected to be recoverable in the future 
this evaluation considers positive and negative evidence in order to assess whether it is more likely than not that a portion of the asset will not be realized 
the risk of a valuation allowance increases if continuing operating losses are incurred 
a valuation allowance on our tax asset could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity 
our operating losses as well as our indebtedness and lease obligations could materially adversely affect our financial health  limit our ability to finance future acquisitions and capital expenditures  and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 
our indebtedness and lease obligations could have important consequences to us  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future  a substantial portion of our current cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations and other purposes  and some of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which exposes us to the risk of increasing interest rates 
in addition  our debt instruments contain numerous covenants that limit our discretion with respect to business matters  including acquisitions  paying dividends  redeeming our convertible notes prior to maturity  repurchasing our common stock  incurring additional debt or disposing of assets 
other covenants are financial in nature  including current and fixed charge ratios or minimum net worth requirements 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement or indenture 
in addition  a default under one agreement or indenture could result in a default and acceleration of our repayment obligations under the other agreements or indentures under the cross default provisions in those agreements or indentures 

table of contents certain debt agreements contain subjective acceleration clauses based on a lender deeming itself insecure or if a material adverse change in our business has occurred 
if these clauses are implicated and the lender declares that an event of default has occurred  the outstanding indebtedness would likely be immediately due and owing 
if these events were to occur  we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
even if new financing were available  it may not be on terms acceptable to us 
as a result of this risk  we could be forced to take actions that we otherwise would not take  or not take actions that we otherwise might take  in order to comply with these agreements and indentures 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to attract additional qualified management personnel could adversely affect our operations and growth 
our success depends to a significant degree on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  particularly sidney b 
deboer  our chairman and chief executive officer  and bryan b 
deboer  our president and chief operating officer 
further  we have identified sidney b 
deboer and or bryan b 
deboer in most of our store franchise agreements as the individuals who control the franchises and upon whose financial resources and management expertise the manufacturers may rely when awarding or approving the transfer of any franchise 
the sole voting control of our company is currently held by sidney b 
deboer who may have interests different from your interests 
further  all of the class b shares of the company held by lithia holdings are pledged  with other assets  to secure personal indebtedness of mr 
deboer 
the failure to repay the indebtedness could result in the sale of such shares and the loss of such control  which may violate agreements with certain manufacturers  including toyota motor sales usa 
lithia holding company  llc  of which sidney b 
deboer  our chairman and chief executive officer  is the sole managing member  holds all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock 
a holder of class b common stock is entitled to ten votes for each share held  while a holder of class a common stock is entitled to one vote per share held 
on most matters  the class a and class b common stock vote together as a single class 
as of march   lithia holding controlled approximately of the aggregate number of votes eligible to be cast by stockholders for the election of directors and most other stockholder actions 
therefore  lithia holding will control the election of our board of directors and will be in a position to control the policies and operations of the company 
in addition  because mr 
deboer is the managing member of lithia holding  he currently controls and will continue to control  all of the outstanding class b common stock  thereby allowing him to control the company 
so long as at least of the total number of shares outstanding are shares of class b common stock  the holders of class b common stock will be able to control all matters requiring approval of or less of the aggregate number of votes 
lithia holdings has pledged all of the class b common stock with other personal assets of mr 
deboer  to secure a personal loan to mr 
deboer from u s bank  na 
should he be unable to repay the loan  the bank could foreclose against the class b common stock  which would result in the automatic conversion of such shares to class a common stock 
in such event  mr 
deboer would no longer be in control of the company and this loss change in control  if not consented to by the manufacturers  would be a technical violation under most of the dealer sales and service agreements held by the company 
however  applicable state franchise laws prohibit manufacturers from unreasonably withholding consent to a change in control or the appointment of a new individual responsible for the operations of a store should a loss in control also result in the removal of both sid deboer and bryan deboer who are currently named 
further  the current pledge of class b common stock does not comply with the exception to such pledges provided in the framework agreement between the company and toyota motor sales  usa  inc mr 
deboer is in the process of seeking from toyota motors sales approval of this pledge 
failure to receive such approval could result in disallowance of future toyota store acquisitions by the company but would not be a violation of any of the sales and service agreements on existing toyota stores

washington state b o tax suit on october   marcia johnson and theron johnson the johnsons  on their own behalf and on behalf of a proposed plaintiff class of all other similarly situated individuals and entities  filed suit in the superior court for the state of washington  spokane county case no

table of contents of a proposed defendant class of other motor vehicle dealers  asking for an award of declaratory and injunctive relief  and damages  based on defendants allegedly illegal practice of itemizing and collecting the washington state business and occupation tax b o tax from customers buying vehicles from defendants 
the allegations in the johnson case involve legal issues similar to those that were litigated in the case of nelson vs 
appleway chevrolet  inc the nelson case 
by agreement of the parties  the johnson case was stayed while the nelson case  which had been filed in  was appealed to the washington state supreme court 
in april  the washington supreme court upheld the lower court decisions in favor of the plaintiffs in the nelson case 
the decision was based on the appleway dealer s practice of adding a b o tax charge to a vehicle s purchase price after the customer and the dealer reached agreement on the vehicle s price 
because lithia s subsidiary negotiated with the johnsons over a proposed b o tax charge before reaching agreement with the johnsons on a purchase price for the johnsons new vehicle  lithia and its subsidiary believe the subsidiary s actions are permissible under the law as established by the supreme court s decision in the nelson case 
they moved for summary judgment based on the washington supreme court s decision in the nelson case 
shortly after the filing of that motion  the johnsons filed an amended complaint 
they added an allegation that the defendants actions also violated washington s consumer protection act  and requested an award of treble damages up to  for each alleged violation of the act 
the johnsons then cross moved for partial summary judgment  contending that the supreme court s decision in the nelson case established that lithia and its subsidiary had violated washington s tax and consumer protection act laws 
after hearing oral argument on the motions  the trial court judge  on october   issued an oral ruling in favor of the johnsons and against the lithia subsidiary 
the court denied lithia s and its subsidiary s summary judgment motion 
the court entered its written order to that effect on november  lithia and its subsidiary asked the trial court to certify its order as a final judgment 
after the trial court denied their request  lithia and its subsidiary petitioned the washington court of appeals for discretionary review of the summary judgment decision  which was granted in april in january  the court of appeals reversed the trial court judge s ruling and directed the entry of a summary dismissal order in the case 
plaintiff s may appeal this decision to the washington supreme court or attempt to pursue some other claims in the trial court proceeding

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with item business  item a 
risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are a leading operator of automotive franchises and retailer of new and used vehicles and services 
as of march   we offered brands of new vehicles and all brands of used vehicles in stores in the united states and over the internet 
we sell new and used cars and light trucks  sell replacement parts  provide vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and repair services  and arrange related financing  service contracts  protection products and credit insurance for our automotive customers 
while the us has not experienced a slower auto retail environment in years  in january and february  traffic in our stores was up over our december traffic 
in addition  we believe that we are realizing success from our recent marketing efforts and our continuing cost cutting initiatives to help mitigate the slowing sales environment 
we believe that adhering to strict cost cutting measures and improving our balance sheet by reducing debt and preserving cash  while still focusing on satisfying our customers  should enable us to come through the tough economic times as a stronger  more viable company 
however  no assurances can be given that industry sales will not experience a further decline  or that our restructuring plan will be of sufficient magnitude to guarantee success in a declining market 
economic environment during as discussed in overview in item  business  above  during  overall macroeconomic issues have reduced consumers desire and ability to purchase automobiles 
an additional factor negatively impacting auto sales has been a reduction in available options for consumer auto loans 
the manufacturers captive financing companies have suffered additional pressure as the financial crisis has raised their cost of funds and reduced their access to capital 
this has prevented them from offering as many incentives designed to drive sales  such as subsidized interest rates and the amount of loan to value they are willing to advance on vehicles 
the number of customers visiting our stores has significantly declined from prior years 
we believe one of the reasons showroom traffic has suffered is that customers are assuming that financing is not available or that they would not qualify for vehicle financing 
one of the main objectives of our recent advertising has focused on overcoming this obstacle and communicating that consumer vehicle financing continues to be available 
this is evidenced by the fact that we were still able to arrange financing on approximately of the vehicles we sold during the fourth quarter of  although at substantially lower volumes 
in addition  both new and used vehicle sales have been impacted in by declining valuations for most used vehicles 
fewer customers are trading in their used vehicles as the value many could receive is less than what they currently owe 
this has negatively affected our new vehicle sales as many potential customers are not able to obtain financing to absorb the amount owed on their trade in as well as the cost of the new vehicle 
restructuring and cost cutting initiatives as the economic environment continued to deteriorate in the second half of  we continued to take steps to achieve profitably in the current adverse market conditions  as well as to position ourselves for our long term growth objectives 
the restructuring plan we announced on june  was subsequently expanded to include additional initiatives 
as of march   we identified a total of stores for divestiture and  as of this date  of these stores had been sold  had been closed  and remained for sale  one of which had a preliminary agreement signed for its sale 
these actions will reduce our store count by approximately one fourth and will move us closer to our goal of a long term domestic import new vehicle sales mix 

table of contents our restructuring plans also included the following cost cutting measures re aligning store management personnel and duties  reducing non production headcount across the company  reducing non essential store expenses  consolidating vendors and negotiating favorable payment terms  reducing all corporate level expenses where possible  and further centralizing offices by region 
in addition to the store divestitures discussed above  the following restructuring actions are underway to help preserve capital and improve profitability deferring all uncommitted capital expenditures  selling certain development property and other assets  including aircraft and excess land  financing certain unfinanced real estate  postponing acquisitions until prices stabilize  and adjusting inventory levels to meet consumers shift in demand for new and used vehicles 
the above actions have allowed us to achieve approximately million of annualized savings through december  and we will continue to identify additional cost savings in the future without impacting customer service 
as part of our restructuring plan  the investment in additional l locations was placed on hold as we were unwilling to continue to absorb the expected startup losses 
after we placed the initiative on hold  certain personnel associated with the project were terminated and others were re assigned to other areas 
the existing l stores have been integrated into the lithia platform and we are utilizing all of the lithia systems in the locations 
we closed our loveland l location in june and are currently using the facility in a re formatted used car operation 
in september  we completed the sale of our cedar rapids l location 
we closed our amarillo l location in november and are currently using the facility in a re formatted used car operation 
we currently operate an l location in lubbock  texas 
however  the lubbock location has been revamped to essentially operate as a traditional lithia store to gain operational efficiencies and to unify selling systems across the organization 
we did not incur any material severance  lease termination or other restructuring charges related to any of these restructuring actions in manufacturer information historically  manufacturers have offered incentives on new vehicle sales through a combination of repricing strategies  rebates  lease programs  early lease cancellation programs and low interest rate loans to consumers 
through the first half of  this strategy continued 
however  in response to tightening in credit markets  in the third quarter of  we saw a shift away from leasing and subsidized financing to dealer and consumer rebates and repricing strategies 
in july  chrysler financial announced the termination of its lease program 
we have not seen a significant impact due to this change as the majority of our transactions with chrysler financial are retail installment contracts  not leases 
we have received additional retail incentives as a result of the termination of its lease program and may receive additional incentives in the future 
in october  the domestic automakers approached congress seeking government assistance 
as part of these hearings  each manufacturer provided an update on their current financial situation as well as their outlook for and beyond 
in the course of the hearings  it became clear that without immediate assistance  both chrysler and general motors gm faced the possibility of insolvency as early as january 
table of contents in december  the federal government provided billion in bridge loans to both chrysler and gm 
stipulated with the loans was the condition that both manufacturers return to the treasury in february and provide a restructuring plan 
at the time of this filing  both chrysler and gm have provided their plans to the treasury requesting up to billion in total support  including the billion already provided  and are acting on those plans 
however  the response by the federal government to these strategies remains unknown 
we believe that in the event either or both plans are rejected  a chapter bankruptcy filing would occur 
we have developed contingency plans to respond in the event of such a filing 
no assurances can be given that our contingency plans will be adequate to address the magnitude of these scenarios 
goodwill and other asset impairment charges our financial results for included million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges included as a component of operating loss and an additional million as a component of discontinued operations 
see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
gain on early retirement of senior subordinated convertible notes during the third and fourth quarters of  we redeemed a total of half  or million principal amount  of our senior subordinated convertible notes at a discount  which resulted in a gain on early retirement of million  which was included as a component of other income  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   million of our senior subordinated convertible notes remained outstanding 
pro forma results of operations on a non gaap basis  the elimination of the effect of the non cash impairment charges and the gain on early retirement of debt would have resulted in a net improvement of our net loss before taxes by approximately million to net income before taxes of million in in addition  excluding the non cash impairment charges and the gain on early retirement of debt of per share in continuing operations and per share including discontinued operations  on a non gaap basis we had income of per diluted share from continuing operations  and a loss of per diluted share including discontinued operations 
the loss recorded under gaap was per diluted share from continuing operations and per diluted share including discontinued operations 
for a reconciliation of the non gaap financial data  see pro forma reconciliations  below 
the financial tables contain certain non gaap financial measures as defined under sec rules  such as net income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  adjusted in each case to exclude certain disclosed items 
as required by sec rules  we have provided reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures  which are set forth herein 
we believe that the non gaap financial measures improve the transparency of our disclosure  provide a meaningful presentation of our results from our core business operations excluding the impact of items not related to our ongoing core business operations  and improve the period to period comparability of our results from our core business operations 
outlook we anticipate a continued weak economic environment in despite the economic weakness  we believe the actions discussed in restructuring and cost cutting initiatives will help mitigate its impact 
as retailers  we are able to reduce many variable costs  a majority of which are personnel related  and adjust our inventories relatively quickly 
in addition to these variable costs  we have cut fixed costs totaling approximately million annually 
we remain committed to quickly and aggressively responding to any further decline in the overall economy or the automotive retail environment and are prepared to continue to reduce costs if current conditions deteriorate 
in  we believe the impact of gasoline prices on the value of trucks and suvs and reduced industry sales resulted in below normal profit margins on vehicles 
we intend to improve our vehicle margins by 
table of contents improving our inventory mix to meet current demand 
this action has resulted in improved margins on both new and used vehicles in the fourth quarter of we believe that margins in will be consistent with the margins experienced in the fourth quarter of we also adjusted our used vehicle inventory mix throughout and believe that  going into  we are better positioned with a mix of vehicles that customers are currently demanding 
also  as vehicle sales decline  we are emphasizing the more stable  higher margin service  body and parts business  which improves our overall gross profit margins stated as a percentage of our total revenue

table of contents revenues total revenues decreased and increased  respectively  in compared to and in compared to the decrease in compared to primarily resulted from reduced demand and decreased same store sales  which were brought on by the challenging retail environment  higher fuel prices  tighter credit environment  declines in available home equity  low consumer confidence and the weak economy 
the increase in compared to was a result of acquisitions  partially offset by a decrease in same store sales  excluding fleet 
faced a difficult comparison with when total same store sales grew by 
the decrease in same store sales in was also impacted by a weak retail sales environment  especially with our domestic brands 
same store sales percentage increases decreases were as follows compared to compared to new vehicle retail  excluding fleet used vehicle  retail used vehicle  wholesale total vehicle sales  excluding fleet finance and insurance service  body and parts total sales  excluding fleet same store sales are calculated for stores that were in operation as of december   and only including the months of operations for both comparable periods 
for example  a store acquired in june would be included in same store operating data beginning in july  after its first full complete comparable month of operation 
thus  operating results for same store comparisons would include only the periods of july through december of both comparable years 
penetration rates for certain products were as follows finance and insurance service contracts lifetime oil change and filter compared to the decline in same store total vehicle sales  excluding fleet  in compared to was primarily a result of the retail environment  but was exacerbated by our heavier domestic automaker exposure 
through the second quarter of  increasing gas prices pushed consumer demand towards smaller  more fuel efficient vehicles 
however  as gas prices have decreased  demand for heavier trucks and suvs has returned 
however  this trend was more than offset by a decline in the overall macroeconomic environment  as the majority of automakers experienced double digit declines in sales when compared to the prior year 
the average price of new vehicles sold in increased slightly over the average prices for  but the number of vehicles sold was significantly lower 
vehicle prices increased in compared to due to a higher average invoice cost and also due to a shift away from the volume based strategy we adopted in prior years 
the average price of used vehicles sold decreased in compared to as we worked through an inventory of vehicles that was not in high demand  a shift towards cars and away from trucks and as a reduction in available credit decreased the amount of financing customers could obtain  which resulted in lower average transactions 

table of contents our finance and insurance sales were down in compared to  both on an overall basis and a same store basis  primarily due to the overall decline in vehicles sold combined with a decline in the average warranty and other finance product sales per retail unit 
as fewer credit challenged customers were able to receive financing  the overall mix of customers had improved credit quality 
as there are more lenders for stronger credit customers  loans are more competitive and less profitable to us 
additionally  the tightening of credit markets has limited the payment to income and debt to income ratios that are required by lenders  reducing the opportunity to add insurance and warranty products as their impact on payment may exceed financing limits 
however  despite the tightening of the credit markets  we were able to maintain our finance and insurance penetration rate at in our service  body and parts business was less affected by the challenging economic environment in than our other business lines 
this demonstrates the counter cyclicality of this component of our business 
we focus on customer satisfaction in an effort to keep our customers returning to our facilities for their service needs 
warranty work accounts for approximately of our same store service  body and parts sales 
same store warranty sales in were up compared to our domestic brand warranty work increased by  while import luxury warranty work decreased by 
the customer pay service and parts business  which represented approximately of the total service  body and parts business in  was down on a same store basis compared to compared to the decline in new vehicle same store sales in compared to was primarily due to a slowing sales environment in and declining sales of domestic manufacturers vehicles that represented a large percentage of our new vehicle sales 
due to aggressive manufacturer incentive programs in  which were not sustained at the same level in  same store new vehicle unit sales were down in compared to the decrease in same store unit sales was partially offset by a increase in same store average selling prices 
the decline in same store used retail vehicle sales in compared to was primarily due to the slowing sales environment mentioned above 
same store used retail unit sales decreased in compared to the same store unit decrease was partially offset by a increase in same store average selling prices 
the increase in used wholesale vehicle same store sales in compared to resulted from a increase in same store average selling prices  partially offset by a decrease in same store unit sales 
same store finance and insurance sales were negatively affected in compared to by decreases in same store vehicle unit sales  which lowered the overall opportunity for finance and insurance sales 
this was offset by a increase in the finance and insurance sales per unit in compared to the increase in same store service  body and parts sales in compared to was primarily due to a increase in the customer paid portion of the business 
the customer paid portion of the business excludes warranty and represented approximately of total service  body and parts sales in in addition  we realized a increase in same store warranty sales 

table of contents gross profit gross profit decreased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the decrease in compared to primarily resulted from decreased total revenues  while the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased total revenues 
gross profit margins achieved were as follows year ended december  basis point change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts overall year ended december  basis point change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts overall a basis point is equal to th of one percent 
compared to new vehicle margins were flat in compared to as negative effects of the challenging economic environment were offset by a shift in consumer demand to cars vs 
trucks and suvs 
our stores typically target a dollar amount of profit on each vehicle sale  rather than a percentage 
as such  when the average vehicle sale price declines but the profit remains consistent  margins are positively affected 
margins were up on new cars  while they were down on trucks and suvs as we lowered pricing on these vehicles in order to clear out older inventory 
given the reduced number of new vehicle sales transactions  we implemented training and focused our stores on maintaining the profit on each vehicle retailed 
this focus helped to offset the broader impact on revenues and margins due to the declining economy 
the challenging retail environment led to the declines in gross profit margins in retail and wholesale used vehicle sales in compared to we adjusted the pricing on our used vehicle inventories due to a shift in the types of used vehicles in demand in an effort to reduce inventory levels and lower amounts outstanding on our credit facility 
also  the tightening of the credit markets affected the ability of customers to obtain financing  and reduced the overall amount of credit available to each customer 
as such  customers sought out lower priced used vehicles 
this shift  which improves margins as we target a specific dollar amount of profit per transaction rather than a percentage  helped to offset some of the pricing adjustments discussed above 
service  body and parts gross margins increased in compared to due to concentration on maximizing all profit opportunities in the service drive through the sale of additional service work and fewer consumer discounts and promotions  partially offset by the continued shift to parts and accessories business and more competitive pricing on service work in order to emphasize volume 
as vehicle sales decline  more expensive service work is required due to the increased average age of vehicles in service 
we expect this trend to positively impact our operations until the new car market recovers 

table of contents compared to gross profit margins for both new vehicle and retail used vehicle sales decreased in compared to primarily as a result of the slowing retail sales environment 
the decrease in wholesale used vehicle gross profit margin in compared to was due to wholesale market conditions and a focus on retailing more used vehicles 
our ability to provide customers with a better value for their trade ins  offering closer to their true market value  has been improved by our use of technology 
this improves our ability to retail new vehicles 
however  this lowers the gross profit margin we are able to achieve on the re sale of the trade ins we elect to wholesale 
in addition  as we focus on retailing more used vehicles  we are left with the lower quality used vehicles for wholesaling  which also contributed to lower gross profit margins 
we dispose of our wholesale used vehicles by using centralized controls  holding our own local used vehicle auctions and managing the disposal of units at larger third party auctions 
gross profit margins in the service  body and parts business line decreased in compared to partially due to a shift in mix towards selling more parts and accessories  which carry lower margins than the service side of the business 
however  due to an increase in volume  same store gross profit increased in compared to goodwill and other asset impairment charges pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
in addition  long lived assets held and used by us and intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
by the second half of  cracks in the credit market brought about by accelerating defaults on home mortgages had begun to appear in various forms including the declining availability of consumer credit at commercially viable rates reducing the breadth of our potential customer base  and the willingness including financial capability of manufacturers to offer consumer incentives previously relied upon to reinvigorate car sales to sustainable levels customarily experienced by the industry 
the proliferation of these issues resulted in a rapid deterioration of business conditions throughout the second quarter of further  rapidly escalating oil prices to unprecedented levels  and the potential for oil prices to increase even more  dramatically affected the confidence of the american consumer 
consequently  these factors diminished their willingness to purchase big ticket items such as automobiles and  more specifically  the profitable large trucks and suvs then being offered by many of our manufacturers 
in response to the deterioration of business conditions and the resultant decline in automobile sales  we announced a restructuring plan on june  that plan called for a reduction in store and support personnel  the sale of certain non essential assets  and the deferral of non essential expenditures including administrative centralization and operational initiatives 
the most significant component of the restructuring was our decision to divest locations 
as a result of our decision to dispose of approximately of our stores  an adverse and rapidly changing business climate  our resultant reduced earnings and cash flow forecast and a significant decline in our market capitalization  we determined that our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  as well as our other long lived assets  required an interim impairment test 
the interim impairment test required us to update the adjusted present value apv model used in determining the fair value of our business  and by extension  the valuation of our goodwill 

table of contents the unexpected and unprecedented material changes in the economic and credit environment experienced in the first six months of caused us to revise certain key assumptions in our determination of the fair value of our business 
also  we determined that cost savings  particularly those associated with administrative centralization and operational initiatives could not be realized in the current environment as the dramatic shift in economic conditions caused us to defer their implementation 
the total impact of the changes to key assumptions materially reduced the estimated value of our business 
inherent difficulties existed in forecasting the extent and magnitude of the macroeconomic correction underway  and the effect such a correction would have on our business at the time we were evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill in connection with the finalization of our recoverability assessment 
by the end of the second quarter of  the fundamental changes in the economic landscape were obvious  however  few had the foresight to forecast the degree and speed by which deteriorating credit markets would significantly undermine the overall health of the us economy 
we believe we acted prudently in concluding our goodwill was permanently impaired in the second quarter of  consistent with the realization that the state of the automobile industry had suffered and the effect of the credit crisis had spread throughout the broader economy 
as a result of our analysis  the following impairment charges were recorded within continuing operations in goodwill million franchise value and other intangibles million real estate million equipment million terminated construction projects million other million total impairment million after the charge  and the allocation of goodwill to stores classified within discontinued operations  our remaining balance in goodwill is zero 
following the million charge related to our indefinite lived intangible assets franchise value  the remaining value of our indefinite lived intangible assets was approximately million as of december  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

the increase in depreciation and amortization has slowed as we have slowed our acquisition and improvement projects and disposed of stores during the weak economic environment

if a particular location does not meet certain return on investment criteria established by our management team  the location is targeted for potential disposition 
if a store that has been identified for potential disposition does not improve its operations for an extended period of time  the decision is made to divest the location 
additional factors we consider that may result in the disposition of a location include capital commitment requirements  our estimate of local market and franchise outlook  and the geographic location of certain stores 
when the decision is made to dispose of a location  we evaluate the store to ensure that it meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale  as defined by paragraph of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this evaluation includes the following considerations our executive management group  possessing the necessary authority  commits to a plan to dispose the store 

table of contents the store is available for immediate sale in its present condition 
the sale is subject only to terms that are usual and customary 
we initiate an active program to locate buyers and take other actions that are required to sell the store 
we believe there is a market for the store and that its disposal is likely 
we also expect to record the transfer of the store as a completed sale within one year 
we actively market the store for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to current estimated fair value 
we believe it is unlikely management will make significant changes to the plan or withdraw the plan 
we have not  to date  withdrawn any plan related to the disposal of store locations 
when a store has been classified as held for sale for a period exceeding one year  we evaluate whether we continue to meet the criteria of sfas no 
 which states that we must evaluate whether we initiated actions necessary to respond to the poor market conditions during the initial one year period  continue to actively market the asset at a price that is reasonable in view of market conditions  and continue to meet all of the other criteria in paragraph for classifying the asset as held for sale 
in the second quarter of  we had three stores classified as held for sale for a period exceeding one year 
additionally  as part of the restructuring plan announced on june   we performed an evaluation of our portfolio of stores  resulting in underperforming stores  mostly consisting of domestic franchises  being selected for disposal 
we also elected to close a facility at that time 
given these facts  we evaluated whether the classification of all stores as held for sale and presented in discontinued operations was appropriate under sfas no 
the three stores identified above represented some of the worst performing locations in our portfolio 
their poor performance  coupled with the increasingly negative environment for automotive retailing  necessitated a longer period to complete the sale of these locations 
over the initial one year period  we had entered into multiple preliminary asset sales agreements  confirming that prospective buyers were interested in these locations 
over the period these stores were available for sale  we continued to lower the price of the three dealerships 
we recorded additional impairment charges to recognize the assets at estimated fair value based on the outlook for potential sale proceeds 
we believe our response to the declining economic factors  diminishing sources of credit with financially viable terms  and overall uncertainty surrounding the future demonstrated that we took actions necessary to respond to a change in circumstances  and that the assets were and continue to be actively marketed at a reasonable price given the continuing changes in circumstances 
finally  for these three locations  we evaluated the six criteria in paragraph of sfas no 
and concluded that we continued to meet the required criteria 
we determined that the stores targeted for disposal as a result of our restructuring plan also met the criteria of paragraph of sfas no 
therefore  we believe that the stores classification in discontinued operations is appropriate 
in addition  during the third quarter of  additional stores were classified as discontinued operations for a total of stores in given the significant number of stores classified as held for sale  and the fact that the sale of certain stores was not prompt  we considered additional factors prior to classifying the additional stores as discontinued operations including the inherent difficulty in selling three of the worst performing stores in our portfolio  and the fact that the other stores targeted for disposal in would be more desirable to potential buyers 
for example  we closed on the sale of two locations in the third quarter of that were initially classified as held for sale in the second quarter of  that one of the locations classified as held for sale for a period exceeding one year had been sold in the third quarter of  and another location had been closed  
table of contents that three stores classified as held for sale in the second quarter of were under preliminary contract to be sold  and that of the stores classified in the third quarter of have been sold or were under preliminary contract to be sold 
therefore  we believe that a market continues to exist for the stores we have targeted for disposal  and that we met the other criteria outlined by paragraph of sfas as of december   we have one store that has been classified as held for sale for a period exceeding one year 
we believe that this store s continued classification in discontinued operations is appropriate 
we disposed of nine stores and closed four stores classified within discontinued operations during as of december   stores were classified as held for sale 
we disposed of three additional stores classified within discontinued operations in the first quarter of through the date of the filing of this form k

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  our sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather in certain of our markets and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance is expected to be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of each fiscal year 
we believe that interest rates  levels of consumer debt  consumer confidence and manufacturer sales incentives  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
acquisitions had also been a contributor to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
however  in  primarily as a result of economic conditions previously described  these historical trends have not continued 
the seasonal improvement typically experienced in the second and third quarters of did not occur  as sales levels remained relatively flat compared with levels experienced in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of we also experienced a decline in sales levels in the fourth quarter of from the flat levels experienced in the first three quarters of we believe this to be the result of a combination of both seasonal trends and overall macroeconomic issues  and uncertainty remains as to the impact of both of these factors in the future

table of contents longer controls the gmac entity 
as a result  we treat the financing of new vehicles by gmac after the change in ownership control as a financing activity 
repayments of floorplan debt on vehicles financed prior to this change in control continue to be classified as an operating activity  which reduced cash flows from operating activities by million in and million in the effect in was immaterial 
on a non gaap basis  the elimination of the effect of the change in control would have increased cash flows from operations and decreased cash flows from financing activities as follows in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities as reported effect of gmac reclassification net cash provided by operating activities  non gaap net cash provided by financing activities as reported effect of gmac reclassification net cash used by financing activities  non gaap we believe the reader should consider this factor when reviewing our statement of cash flows and related cash flows from operating activities 
each of the foregoing non gaap financial measures improves the transparency of our disclosure  provides a meaningful presentation of our results from core business operations excluding the impact of items not related to our ongoing core business operations  and improves the period to period comparability of our results from core business operations 
we do not anticipate this condition to occur in future periods  as floorplan financing does not typically change classification categories in the statement of cash flows 
principal needs our principal needs for liquidity and capital resources are for capital expenditures  working capital and debt repayment 
historically  we have also used capital resources to fund our cash dividend payment and for acquisitions 
we intend to utilize capital resources in the future to pay a dividend and to acquire locations as part of our long term growth strategy 
we have relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements  financing of real estate and the proceeds from public equity and private debt offerings to finance operations and expansion 
during  we generated million through the sale of assets and stores and the issuance of long term debt 
we believe the continued execution of our restructuring plan will result in available cash  cash equivalents  available lines of credit  planned asset sales and cash flows from operations that will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses  debt maturities and capital requirements for at least the next months from december  however  no assurances can be provided that our restructuring plan and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs 
at december   we had sufficient availability utilizing both unadvanced floorplan financing and our credit facility to refinance our remaining million of outstanding notes which can be put to us in may at the option of the holders  and to accommodate our long term growth strategy 
at december   we also had stores held for sale  for which we estimate net proceeds upon sale to be approximately million 
we disposed of three of these stores in the first quarter of through the date of the filing of this form k  generating net proceeds of million 
in addition to the above sources of capital  potential sources of additional liquidity include the placement of subordinated debentures or loans  additional store sales or additional other asset sales 
we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the availability and 
table of contents cost of capital  although no assurances can be provided that these capital sources will be available to us in sufficient amounts or with terms acceptable to us 
summary of outstanding balances on credit facilities interest rates on all of our credit facilities below  excluding the effects of our interest rate swaps  ranged from to at december  amounts outstanding on the lines at december   together with amounts remaining available under such lines were as follows in thousands outstanding at december  maximum availability at december  new and program vehicle lines working capital  acquisition and used vehicle credit facility there are no formal limits on the new and program vehicle lines with certain lenders

the amount available on the line is limited based on a borrowing base calculation and fluctuates monthly 
inventories and flooring notes payable we maintained a disciplined inventory approach throughout as a result of the challenging economic environment  during the second quarter of  we repriced our entire inventory to reflect current demand and pricing in an effort to move older and less popular vehicles 
our days supply of new vehicles at december  was days above our five year average historical days supply and days above our december  levels 
this resulted from the dramatic drop in retail sales in the fourth quarter of we continue to reduce new inventories by ordering less vehicles in order to sell through the inventory on hand 
we reduced our days supply of new vehicles by days between december  and february  given the disruptions in the credit markets  captive finance companies have experienced increases in capital cost and decreases in availability of funds 
we have not experienced any disruption in our inventory flooring arrangements 
rates have gone up by to basis points  with certain lending restrictions on aged inventories 
no assurances can be given that we will not experience disruptions in available credit for new vehicle inventories in the future 
our days supply of used vehicles was days above our historical december balances at december  primarily as a result of our used vehicle repricing strategy  we reduced our days supply of used vehicles by days between june  and december  we reduced our days supply of used vehicles by days between december  and february  we continue to work to respond to changes in consumer demand in order to bring our used vehicle inventory in line with historical levels 
while our days supply of new and used vehicles is up  inventories are down in absolute dollars 
in connection with the decreased inventories  our new vehicle flooring notes payable decreased to million at december  from million at december  new vehicles are financed at approximately of invoice cost 
working capital  acquisition and used vehicle credit facility we have a working capital  acquisition and used vehicle credit facility the credit facility with us bank national association  daimlerchrysler financial services americas llc chrysler financial  dcfs usa llc mercedes financial and toyota motor credit corporation tmcc 
in august  we amended the credit facility  effective as of june  this amendment reduced our minimum net worth ratio and lowered our required covenant performance ratios through the second quarter of  to allow us to operate more effectively in the current economic environment 
beginning in the third quarter of  the covenant performance ratio requirements increase on a quarterly basis so that by the fourth quarter of  they will return to the levels mandated in the original agreement 

table of contents due to the slowing of our acquisition plans  and in an effort to reduce the fees associated with unutilized credit  the total amount available on the line was reduced from million to million in connection with the fourth amendment 
as part of the fourth amendment  we received approval to dispose of approximately million in assets  including assets currently held for sale 
the schedule of assets approved for disposal was updated in a fifth amendment to the credit facility in december in addition  under the fourth amendment  cash dividends were limited to per share in the third quarter of and are permitted  based on a formula  beyond that quarter 
although we suspended our dividend based on fourth quarter results  we would not have been allowed to pay it under the formula stipulated by the agreement 
repurchases by us of our common stock are not permitted without the prior approval of our lenders 
the interest rate on the agreement increased  which resulted in additional expense of approximately million  or per share  in we were assessed a million change fee on the amendment and the maturity date was revised to april  we believe the credit facility continues to be an attractive source of financing given the current cost and availability of credit alternatives 
loans are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and are secured by new vehicle inventory  used vehicle and parts inventory  equipment other than fixtures  deposit accounts  accounts receivable  investment property and other intangible personal property 
capital stock and other equity interests of our subsidiary stores and certain other subsidiaries are excluded 
the lenders security interest in new vehicle inventory is subordinated to the interests of floorplan financing lenders  including chrysler financial  mercedes financial and tmcc 
the agreement for this facility provides for events of default that include nonpayment  breach of covenants  a change of control and certain cross defaults with other indebtedness 
in the event of a default  the agreement provides that the lenders may declare the entire principal balance immediately due  foreclose on collateral and increase the applicable interest rate to the revolving loan rate plus percent  among other remedies 
new vehicle flooring chrysler financial  mercedes financial  tmcc  ford motor credit company  gmac llc  vw credit  inc  american honda finance corporation and bmw financial services na  llc have agreed to floor new vehicles for their respective brands

the new vehicle lines are secured by new vehicle inventory of the stores financed by that lender 
vehicles financed by lenders not directly associated with the manufacturer are classified as floorplan notes payable non trade and are included as a financing activity in our statements of cash flows 
vehicles financed by lenders directly associated with the manufacturer are classified as floorplan notes payable and are included as an operating activity 
debt covenants we are subject to certain financial and restrictive covenants for all of our debt agreements 
the credit facility agreement includes financial and restrictive covenants typical of such agreements including requirements to maintain a minimum total net worth  minimum current ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and cash flow leverage ratio 
the covenants restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness  making investments  selling or acquiring assets and granting security interests in our assets 
we utilize an internal forecast to project compliance with our covenants 
top line revenue numbers were significantly worse than our internal forecast had anticipated for the second half of despite this negative development  we were able to improve our vehicle margins and reduce our sg a and other costs in line with these changes 
as a result  our overall attainment to forecasted results was near expectation 
we believe our forecast utilizes assumptions that are conservative 
the fourth amendment to our credit facility stipulates a minimum net worth of not less than million  with an additional reduction of up to million related to any intangible asset impairment charges 
this net worth covenant is adjusted up by of any net income amounts  and is not adjusted down based on net 
table of contents loss amounts 
our fixed charge coverage ratio cannot be less than  and our cash flow leverage ratio cannot be more than to our minimum current ratio cannot be less than as of december   our minimum net worth was approximately million  our fixed charge coverage ratio was to  our cash flow leverage ratio was to and our minimum current ratio was to based on this data  we were in compliance with the four financial covenants set forth in our credit facility 
based on our most recent forecast for  we have identified the risk of non compliance with our minimum current ratio covenant required by our credit facility in the quarterly measurement period ending june  in the second quarter of  the credit facility will have a remaining term of less than one year and will therefore become classified as a current obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are in negotiations to amend certain terms and conditions of the credit facility  including the minimum current ratio covenant  to ensure prospective compliance 
we believe we will be successful in obtaining the amendment 
however  if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the amendment  we will commence a number of initiatives to create sufficient liquidity to pay down the required outstanding balance on the credit facility 
as previously disclosed  we have identified for sale a number of non strategic properties and dealerships 
several dealerships are under executed sale agreements and are expected to close prior to june   subject to normal terms and conditions in the industry 
in addition  we are in the process of financing  or refinancing  certain real properties with other third party lenders 
in the event sales of identified properties and dealerships and the financing of properties do not result in sufficient levels of proceeds  or do not occur within the time frame necessary to enable us to comply with our june  minimum current ratio covenant  we intend to accelerate and expand upon additional cost cutting and cash generating initiatives currently being implemented 
the acceleration and expansion of these initiatives is expected to provide additional liquidity in sufficient levels to repay all outstanding amounts on the credit facility by june  and to continue operations without further advances on the credit facility through at least december  these initiatives include reducing the days supply of inventories of used vehicles and parts  increasing the flooring and or refinancing of program and employee operated vehicles  reduction of employee compensation  deferring certain capital expenditures and paying vendors and service providers pursuant to their maximum stipulated terms or on revised terms 
however  no assurances can be provided that we will be successful in executing these plans  including obtaining an amendment to the credit facility  completing the sale of dealerships and non strategic properties  financing or refinancing certain real properties  or achieving liquidity through other initiatives 
in the event that we are unable to meet the financial and restrictive covenants  we would enter into a discussion with the lenders to remediate the condition 
if we were unable to remediate or cure the condition  a breach would give rise to certain remedies under the agreement  the most severe of which is the termination of the agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed 
senior subordinated convertible notes due following our repurchases through the filing date of this form k  which totaled million of face amount  as of march   we had outstanding million of notes due we will also pay contingent interest on the notes during any six month interest period beginning may   in which the trading price of the notes for a specified period of time equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the notes

a declaration and payment of a dividend in excess of per share per quarter will result in additional adjustments in the conversion rate for the notes if such cumulative adjustment exceeds of the current conversion rate 
the january and july dividends resulted in changes in the current conversion rate per  of notes  which is currently

share repurchase and dividends our board of directors declared dividends of per share on our class a and class b common stock  which were paid in january  april and july and totaled approximately million each payment period 
in addition  our board of directors declared a dividend of per share on our class a and class b common stock related to third quarter  which totaled million and was paid on october  management evaluates performance and makes a recommendation on dividend payments on a quarterly basis 
pursuant to our amended credit facility  cash dividends were limited to per share in the third quarter of and are allowed  based on a formula  beyond that quarter 
based on our fourth quarter results and the broader economy  we suspended our dividend for the quarter 
however  a dividend would not have been allowed pursuant to our credit facility 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock 
through december   we have purchased a total of  shares under this program  none of which were purchased during the fourth amendment to the credit facility requires lender approval prior to any share repurchases 
we may continue to repurchase shares from time to time in the future if permitted by our credit facilities and as conditions warrant 
current tax law tends to equalize the benefits of dividends and share repurchases as a means to return capital or earnings to shareholders

we already incurred million for these projects and anticipate incurring the remaining million in in the second quarter of  we terminated approximately million of non essential construction projects and placed other pending capital investments on hold 
as a result of these actions  we recorded an expense of approximately million  of which million was related to invoiced expenditures and million was related to capitalized interest incurred on the expenditures and associated land 
we expect to pay for the construction out of existing cash balances  construction financing and borrowings on our line of credit 
upon completion of the projects  we anticipate securing long term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for to of the amounts expended  although no assurances can be provided that these financings will be available to us in sufficient amounts or with terms acceptable to us 
we anticipate approximately million in non financeable capital expenditures in the next one to three years for various new facilities and other construction projects currently under consideration 
non financeable capital expenditures are defined as minor upgrades to existing facilities  minor leasehold improvements  the percentage of major construction typically not financed by commercial mortgage debt  and purchases of furniture and equipment 
we will continue to evaluate the advisability of the expenditures given the current weak economic environment  and anticipate a prudent approach to future capital commitments 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on assumptions made by management 
while we have made our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our most critical accounting estimates include assessment of recoverability of our deferred tax asset  indefinite lived intangible assets  recoverability of long lived assets  estimates of expected proceeds on assets held for sale  service contract and lifetime oil contract income recognition and workers compensation insurance premium accrual 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for valuation of accounts receivable  expense accruals and revenue recognition 
however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable 
however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of a change in assumptions deferred tax asset due to impairment of goodwill and franchise value  we are in a position where our future tax deductible amounts exceed our future tax payable amounts 
as of december   we have a net deferred tax asset of approximately million 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income  projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  and available tax planning strategies  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
at december   we have not recorded any valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
however  a valuation allowance could be recorded in the future if estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
if we are unable to meet the projected operational results utilized in our analysis  and depending on the nature of our operations as compared to available tax planning strategies  we might record a valuation allowance on a portion or all of our deferred tax asset 
in the event that the domestic manufacturers are unable to remain solvent  our operations may be impacted and we might record a valuation allowance on a portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
in the event that we are forced to file for bankruptcy protection  we would be forced to record a valuation allowance on all of the deferred tax asset 

table of contents nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of a change in assumptions indefinite lived intangible assets we have determined that our franchise agreements with various manufacturers represent the most significant portion of intangible assets without a definite life 
we review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually by applying a fair value based test using the apv method to indicate fair value 
during  we reviewed our indefinite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of  as discussed above 
we also reviewed our indefinite lived intangible assets at the end of the fourth quarter of additionally  we stipulate a period of time prior to testing assets that have been recently acquired in order to allow them to be integrated into our operations 
as we have not recently acquired any stand alone locations  no assets were excluded from testing in future cash flows are based on recently prepared forecasts and business plans to estimate the future economic benefits that the store will generate 
we estimate the appropriate discount rate to convert the future economic benefits to their present value equivalent 
we have determined that only certain cash flows of the store are attributable to the franchise value 
according to emerging issues task force eitf  unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  we have concluded that the appropriate unit of accounting for determining franchise value is on an individual store basis 
growth rates are calculated for five years based on management s forecasted sales projections 
the growth rates used for periods beyond five years are calculated based on the us department of labor  bureau of labor statistics for historical consumer price index data 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows is derived from an apv model which factors in an equity risk premium  small stock risk premium  a beta and a risk free rate 
we also evaluate each franchise based on management s judgment and have recorded impairments on certain domestic locations based on this evaluation 
during  we recorded impairments to franchises  which totaled million as a component of continuing operations and million as a component of discontinued operations 
there were no impairments to franchises as a component of continuing operations in or at december  and  other indefinite lived intangible assets were million and million  respectively 
a future decline in store performance  change in projected growth rates  other margin assumptions and changes in interest rates could result in a potential impairment of one or more of our franchises 
in the event that the domestic manufacturers are unable to remain solvent  we may record a partial or total impairment on the remaining franchise value 
as of december   we had domestic franchise value totaling million 

table of contents nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of a change in assumptions long lived assets held and used we review our long lived assets held and used at least annually by calculating the projected undiscounted cash flows the assets are projected to generate over the life of the major asset within the group 
during  we reviewed our long lived assets held and used in the second quarter of  as discussed above 
we also reviewed our long lived assets held and used at the end of the fourth quarter of we evaluate the current and prior two years operating results 
if a store has an operating loss in the current year and one of the prior two  it is evaluated for impairment 
additionally  certain locations near breakeven are also included in the evaluation based on management judgment 
we calculate the projected undiscounted cash flows for each asset group based on internally developed forecasts incorporating historical results for prior periods 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the asset  we obtain market data to determine the fair value of the asset group 
if the fair value of the asset is lower than the carrying value  an impairment is indicated 
we recorded impairment charges of million in as a component of continuing operations where fair value was less than carrying value 
a future decline in store performance  change in projected growth rates  and other margin assumptions could result in a potential impairment of long lived asset groups 
in the event that the domestic manufacturers are unable to remain solvent  we may record an impairment charge on the long lived assets associated with the franchise 
currently  of our long lived assets are associated with domestic franchises and of our long lived assets are associated with corporate operations or import luxury locations 
a continued decline in the commercial real estate market could result in a potential impairment of certain investment properties not currently used in operations 

table of contents nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of a change in assumptions assets held for sale under the requirements of sfas  when assets are classified as held for sale  an estimate of the proceeds that will be received is used to determine the amount of impairment to be recorded  if any 
during  we classified approximately of our locations as held for sale 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million based on our estimate of the proceeds that would be received 
we have a group of personnel who specialize in the purchase and sale of dealership operations 
we also enlist the services of brokers to assist in developing leads and ensuring that our dealership properties are priced competitively 
the ultimate decision on the estimated proceeds to be received is made by management 
we utilize historical experience  current asset purchase agreements  feedback from prospective buyers and third party estimates of value to determine the proceeds we will receive for locations 
we also evaluate the gross margin of our locations and calculate the average percentage of margin used to pay rents for our operations 
this evaluation is compared to the gross margin at locations we are divesting to support the carrying value of real property 
we utilize manheim auction data to determine the wholesale value of our used inventories 
this evaluation is updated quarterly as our used vehicle inventories change 
a future decline in store performance  change in market conditions for commercial real estate  or the potential insolvency of a manufacturer could reduce the proceeds that will be received for the assets 
additionally  if locations are unable to be sold as operating dealerships and are closed  the remaining assets  such as real estate and equipment would need to be sold in the open market 
this could reduce the proceeds that will be received for the assets 
utilizing a valuation guide such as nada or kelly blue book could result in a different result in our used vehicle analysis 
if manheim auction data is not accurate  or market valuations depart from the historical margins manheim has experienced  we could experience losses not indicated in the analysis 
at december   we have approximately million in used vehicle inventory  million in property and equipment  and million in intangible asset value 

table of contents nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of a change in assumptions service contract  lifetime oil change  and other insurance contract income recognition we receive fees from the sale of vehicle service contracts and lifetime oil contracts to customers 
the contracts are sold through an unrelated third party  but we may be charged back for a portion of the fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
we may also participate in future underwriting profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which are recognized as income upon receipt 
we have established a reserve for estimated future charge backs based on an analysis of historical charge backs in conjunction with estimated lives of the applicable contracts 
if future cancellations are different than expected based on historical experience  we could have additional expense or income related to the cancellations in future periods at december  and  this reserve totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
a increase in cancellations would result in an additional reserve of approximately million 
workers compensation insurance premium accrual insurance premiums are determined under a five year retrospective cost policy  whereby premium cost depends on experience 
we accrue premiums based on our historical experience rating  although the actual claims can be something greater or less than the historical experience  which could create our estimated liability to either be under or over accrued 
premiums are based on actual claims plus an insurance component 
we have a maximum exposure to claims in a given year  at which point additional claims are paid by the carrier 
as of december  and  the reserve for workers compensation insurance premiums was million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect that the retrospective cost policy  as opposed to a guaranteed cost with a flat premium  will be the most cost effective over time 
a increase in claims experience would result in additional reserves of approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt we use variable rate debt to finance our new and program vehicle inventory and certain real estate holdings 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt are tied to either the one or three month libor or the prime rate 
these debt obligations therefore expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in these rates 
the flooring debt is based on open ended lines of credit tied to each individual store from the various manufacturer finance companies 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense decreases 
our variable rate flooring notes payable  variable rate mortgage notes payable and other credit line borrowings subject us to market risk exposure 
at december   we had million outstanding under such agreements at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million  net of tax  based on amounts outstanding at december  fixed rate debt the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall because we could refinance for a lower rate 
conversely  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
based on open market trades  we determined that our million of long term convertible fixed interest rate debt outstanding had a fair market value of approximately million at december  in addition  at december   we had million of other long term fixed interest rate debt outstanding with maturity dates of between january and september based on discounted cash flows  we have determined that the fair market value of this long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december  hedging strategies we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
accordingly  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage the variability of our interest rate exposure  thus leveling a portion of our interest expense in a rising or falling rate environment 
we have effectively changed the variable rate cash flow exposure on a portion of our flooring debt to fixed rate cash flows by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swaps 
under the interest rate swaps  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate flooring debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure 
that is  we do not engage in interest rate speculation using derivative instruments 
typically  we designate all interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 

table of contents as of december   we had outstanding the following interest rate swaps with us bank dealer commercial services effective march  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  effective march  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  effective june  a ten year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  effective january  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month  effective may  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  and effective may  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month 
we receive interest on all of the interest rate swaps at the one month libor rate 
the one month libor rate at december  was per annum as reported in the wall street journal 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
these amounts related to our cash flow hedges are recorded as deferred gains or losses in our consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
changes to the fair value of discontinued cash flow hedges are recognized into earnings as a component of floorplan interest expense 
at december   the fair values of all of our agreements was a liability of million 
the estimated amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is million at december  as inventory levels fell and future levels of floorplan debt were expected to decrease  one cash flow hedge was discontinued at the end of the third quarter of due to the forecasted transaction no longer being probable 
additionally  in response to expected decreases in debt levels  we discontinued two cash flow hedges and de designated and re designated certain other swaps in the fourth quarter of the change in the market value of undesignated swaps resulted in a million loss  which was recognized in earnings as a component of floorplan interest expense in the fourth quarter of following the discontinuation and de designation of cash flow hedges  approximately million remained a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december   which will be recognized over the remaining life of these swaps 
ineffectiveness occurs when the amount of change in fair market value of the swap is greater than the change in fair market value of the hypothetical derivative 
any ineffectiveness will be reflected in the floorplan interest expense in our statement of operation in the period in which it occurs 
in and  we recorded  and  respectively  of ineffectiveness 
we did not record any ineffectiveness in risk management policies we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow attributable to both our outstanding and forecasted debt obligations as well as our offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows
