item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of national health investors  inc for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k 
other important factors are identified in item business above 
executive overview national health investors  inc nhi or the company  a maryland corporation  is a real estate investment trust reit that invests primarily in income producing health care properties with emphasis on the long term health care sector 
as of december   we had ownership interests in real estate and mortgage investments excluding assets held for sale totaling approximately  and other investments in preferred stock and marketable securities of  resulting in total invested assets of approximately  founded in  our mission is to invest in health care real estate which generates current income that will be distributed to stockholders 
we have pursued this mission by making mortgage loans and acquiring properties to lease nationwide  primarily in the long term health care industry 
portfolio as of december   we had investments in real estate and mortgage notes receivable in health care facilities located in states consisting of long term care facilities  acute care hospital  medical office buildings  assisted living facilities  retirement centers and residential projects for the developmentally disabled 
these investments consisted of approximately  aggregate carrying value amount of loans to borrowers and  of real estate investments with lessees 
of these facilities  are leased to nhc  a publicly held company and our largest customer 
during  our rental income totaled  of which  or was from facilities leased by nhc 
these facilities include centers subleased to and operated by other companies  the lease payments of which are guaranteed to us by nhc 
nhc was our investment advisor until november  consistent with our strategy of diversification  we have increased our portfolio so that the portion of our real estate portfolio leased by nhc has been reduced from of our total portfolio on october  the date we began operations to of our total real estate portfolio on december   based on the net book value carrying amount of these properties 
in  these assets were transferred by nhc to us at their then current net book value in a non taxable exchange 
many of these assets were substantially depreciated as a result of having been carried on nhc s books for as many as years 
as a result  we believe that the current fair market value of these assets is significantly in excess of their net book value 
to illustrate  rental income in from nhc was  or approximately of our net book value of the facilities leased to nhc 
subsequent ad ditions to the portfolio related to non nhc investments reflect their higher value based on existing costs at the date the investment was made 
as with all assets in our portfolio  we monitor the financial and operating results of each of the nhc properties on a quarterly basis 
in addition to reviewing the consolidated financial results of nhc  the individual center financial results are reviewed including their occupancy  patient mix  state survey results and other relevant information 
at december   of the total invested assets of the health care facilities were operated by publicly held company operators  by regional operators  and by small operators

we invest a portion of our funds in the preferred and common shares of other publicly held reits to ensure the substantial portion of our assets are invested for real estate purposes 
at december   our investments in preferred and common shares of publicly held reits were  and our investments in other available for sale marketable securities were  refer to notes and of our consolidated financial statements for further information 
areas of focus we anticipate making new investments in while continuing to monitor and improve our existing properties 
we continue to cautiously evaluate new portfolio investments and monitor the current prices being offered for health care assets 
however  even as we make new investments  we expect to maintain a relatively low level of debt compared to our equity 
new investments may be funded by our liquid investments and  if needed  by external financing 
we will make new investments where we believe the spreads over our cost of capital will generate returns to our investors 
we have focused on lowering our debt for the past five years 
on july   we paid off our unsecured notes totaling million when they matured 
our debt to equity ratio on december  was  the lowest level in our history 
our liquidity is also strong with cash and marketable securities of  exceeding our total debt outstanding of  at december  on december   we reached an agreement with nhc to extend through december  our current lease on of our real estate properties 
these facilities include four centers which are subleased to other parties 
this extension assures an ongoing relationship with our largest customer 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity and or financial condition 
we consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates  judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows valuations and impairments to our investments the majority of our tenants and borrowers are in the long term health care industry and derive their revenues primarily from medicare  medicaid and other government programs 
amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints 
from time to time  there may be material changes in government reimbursement 
in the past  the long term health care industry has at times experienced material reductions in government reimbursement 
the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments affecting our lessees and borrowers 
in prior years  we had determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred as a result of these events 
decisions about valuations and impairments of our investments require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for real estate properties  the need to recognize an impairment is evaluated on a property by property basis in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recognition of an impairment is based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying amount of the property and may be affected by management s plans  if any  to dispose of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of loan payments and general economic conditions on a specific loan basis in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
on a quarterly basis  we review our notes receivable for realizability when events or circumstances  including the non receipt of principal and interest payments  significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions  indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable 
if necessary  impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or  if foreclosure is probable  the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable 
we evaluate our marketable securities for other than temporary impairments consistent with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas as amended by eitf the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
an impairment of a marketable security would be considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investment and evidence indicates the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties are recoverable and our notes receivable  marketable securities and other investments are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  there are certain of our customers for whom we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that revenue for interest or rent is not probable of collection until received 
for these nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income when assured  which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected 
we identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within days of the date it is due 
this policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight line basis as re quired under fasb statement no 
accounting for leases sfas to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible 
lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property  such as an increase in annual revenues over a base year revenues  are considered to be contingent rentals and are excluded from minimum lease payments in accordance with sfas reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
real estate  mortgage and notes receivable write downs recoveries our borrowers and tenants experience periods of significant financial pressures and difficulties similar to other health care providers 
governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower or at least slow the growth in payments to health care providers 
furthermore  the costs of professional liability insurance have increased significantly during this same period 
since the inception of our company  a number of our facility operators and mortgage loan borrowers have experienced bankruptcy 
others have been forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure or for certain periods failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us 
the following table summarizes our write downs and recoveries for the last three years for both continuing and discontinued operations  recorded in accordance with the provisions of sfas and sfas write downs recoveries years ended december  in thousands real estate mortgages notes receivable net during  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to two kansas facilities to reduce the carrying value of these facilities to fair value  less the cost of selling the facilities 
one of the facilities  located in hoisington  kansas  was sold in november of we have classified the remaining facility as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet and estimate the property will be sold within the next twelve months 
subsequent to year end  we received payment in full of one of our mortgage notes receivable which resulted in a recovery of amounts previously written down and other gains totaling  during  two mortgage notes receivable were paid off  resulting in recoveries of amounts previously written down of  in addition  a recovery from a previous write down of our investment in a mortgage investment pool amounted to  the early payoff of the health services management of texas  llc hsm loan resulted in  of recoveries of amounts previously written down in   and due to significant non payment issues with the original borrower 
the original borrower and personal guarantor filed bankruptcy  then the facilities were sold to hsm 
the new owner significantly improved the operations of the facilities due in large part to increased reimbursement rates to long term care centers by the state of texas 
in  hsm was able to obtain refinancing at a lower interest rate to pay off our notes 
during  three mortgage notes receivable were paid off  resulting in recoveries of amounts previously written down of  one working capital note with an outstanding balance of  was written down due to non payment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for details of the properties identified as impaired real estate investments and non performing loans 
we believe that the carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and notes receivable are realizable including those identified as impaired or non performing and supported by the value of the underlying collateral 
however  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts 
security writedowns and recoveries on december   we were notified by bank of america that it s largest  privately placed  enhanced cash fund called columbia strategic cash fund the fund would be closed and liquidated 
in addition  cash redemptions were temporarily suspended  although redemptions could be filled through a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities consisting principally of high quality corporate debt  mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities  the fund s valuation would be based on the market value of the underlying securities  whereas historically the fund s valuation was based on amortized cost  and interest would continue to accrue 
the carrying value of our investment in the fund on december  was  subsequent to december   and prior to december   we received a pro rata distribution of underlying securities in the fun d as described above of  and cash redemptions of principal totaling  realized losses on the distribution and redemption of securities and cash amounted to  at december   the fair market value of our investment in the fund was estimated to be  and the fair market value of our investment in a separate investment management account ima was estimated to be  for a total of  unrealized losses measured as the difference between fair market value and our original investment  at cost  amounted to  and was reflected as a component of stockholder s equity at december  a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in an impairment to reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security is established 
to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and consider whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to a reporting date and forecasted performance of the investment 
in  we concluded there was an other than temporary impairment of the fund and the ima totaling  which we charged to operations during the third and fourth quarters 
for the year ended december   we received cash redemptions of principal from the fund and ima totaling  exclusive of the other than temporary impairment charges of  realized losses amounting to  were charged to operations 
in  the fair market value of our investment in the fund was estimated to be  and the fair market value of our investment in the separate ima was estimated to be  subsequent to year end  we received cash redemptions of principal of  from the fund and  from the ima 
there were no writedowns or recoveries relating to our investment in marketable securities in or we are in regular communication with the manager of the fund and the ima in order to monitor the net asset value and the expected cash redemption dates based upon the manager s liquidation strategy 
cash redemptions are estimated by the fund manager to occur periodically over the next two years 
interest continues to accrue and is paid to us each month into our regular bank account 
there may be further declines in the value of our investments in the fund and the ima 
to the extent that we determine there is a further decline in the fair market value based on up to date information provided to us by the fund manager  we may recognize additional losses in future periods

funds from operations our basic and diluted funds from operations ffo are  for the year ended december   versus  in  a decrease of 
the decrease in ffo was primarily due to loan recoveries in of amounts previously written down of  a decrease in depreciation of  from related primarily to real estate sold  and an increase in of securities writedowns and realized losses of  ffo represents net earnings available to common stockholders  excluding the effects of asset dispositions  plus depreciation associated with real estate investments 
diluted ffo assumes  if dilutive  the conversion of convertible subordinated debentures  the conversion of cumulative convertible preferred stock and the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method 
we believe that ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions  presentation of operating results for a reit that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative  and should be supplemented with a measure such as ffo 
the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our funds from operations may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits 
since o ther reits may not use our definition of ffo  caution should be exercised when comparing our ffo to that of other reits 
ffo in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance  or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap in the united states  as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
we have complied with the sec s interpretation that impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo 
the sec s position is that impairments on real property are non recurring and are not an appropriate adjustment 
the results of operations for facilities included in assets held for sale or facilities sold have been reported in the current and prior periods as discontinued operations 
the reclassifications to retrospectively reflect the disposition of these facilities had no impact on previously reported ffo 
the net gain on sale of real estate and the deconsolidation of the foreclosure properties previously consolidated due to the requirements of sfas is not an element of ffo in the following table reconciles net income to ffo dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  net income elimination of non cash items in net income real estate depreciation real estate depreciation in discontinued operations gain on partial land sale continuing operations gain on dispositions and deconsolidation discontinued operations basic funds from operations available to common stockholders diluted funds from operations available to common stockholders basic funds from operations per share diluted funds from operations per share shares for basic funds from operations per share shares for diluted funds from operations per share impact of inflation inflation may affect us in the future by changing the underlying value of our real estate or by impacting the cost of financing our operations 
our revenues are generated primarily from long term investments and the operation of long term care facilities 
inflation has remained relatively low during recent periods 
there can be no assurance that future medicare  medicaid or private pay rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases 
certain of our leases require increases in rental income based upon increases in the revenues of the tenants 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
most of our mortgage and other notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
our investment in preferred stock represents an investment in the preferred stock of another reit and yields dividends at a fixed rate of 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments and because the interest rates on our investments in notes receivable and preferred stock are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
as of december    of our debt bears interest at variable rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase  respectively  our future earnings and cash flows related to these debt instruments by  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
the future use of such instruments will be subject to strict approvals by our senior officers 
equity price risk we consider our investments in marketable securities of  at december  as available for sale securities 
we concluded that the decline in the market value of our investment in the fund and separate ima is an other than temporary impairment which was charged to operations 
increases and decreases in the fair market value of our investments in other marketable securities are unrealized gains and losses that are recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with sfas the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
we monitor our investments in marketable securities to consider evidence of whether any portion of our original investment is likely not to be recoverable  at which time we would record an impairment charge to operations 
a hypothetical change in quoted market prices would result in a related  change in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities
