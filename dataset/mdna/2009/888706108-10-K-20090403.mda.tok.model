table of contents part i item business general development of business tivo is a leading provider of technology and services for digital video recorders dvrs 
the subscription based tivo service redefines home entertainment by providing consumers with an easy way to record  watch  and control live television and receive thousands of movies and television shows from cable  broadcast  and broadband sources  as well as other forms of content from broadband sources  such as youtube tm videos  and a vast collection of music videos and songs  and internet radio 
tivo offers such features as season pass recordings  wishlist searches  tivotogo transfers  tivocast content which includes premium content delivered from amazon video on demand  netflix  and others and in the future blockbuster  tivo kidzone  tivo online scheduling  and tivo search 
as of january   there were approximately million subscriptions to the tivo service 
we distribute the tivo dvr through consumer electronics retailers and through our on line store at tivo 
com 
additionally  we provide the tivo service through agreements with leading television service providers such as cable television operators  such as comcast  and in the future cox  and satellite television providers  including directv  as well as international cable and broadcasting companies such as seven networks australia and in the future new zealand and cablevision mexico 
we also provide innovative advertising solutions for the television industry  including a unique platform for advertisers and audience research measurement 
we currently receive revenues from three main sources consumers 
our primary source of revenues is from consumers  who subscribe directly to the tivo service and typically pay us monthly fees of up to per month 
we also offer consumers the option to prepay for one or three years of tivo service at prices ranging from to  or purchase a product lifetime subscription for for existing customers who have at least one other qualifying subscription 
we sell to consumers in part through distribution relationships with major retailers  and direct through our on line store at tivo 
com 
television service providers 
we also work with satellite and cable television providers  including directv  comcast  cablevision mexico  and in the future cox  who pay us recurring monthly fees in order to provide the tivo service to their subscribers 
we receive fees for licensing and professional services from these and other customers as well 
advertisers 
we work directly with television advertisers  agencies  and networks to offer a variety of solutions for the television advertising market 
these include short and long form interactive video advertising  audience research measurement  lead generation  and commerce 
some of our key clients include advertisers and advertising agencies such as grey sf  toyota motors  warner brothers  universal mccann  omd  mediaedge  mediastorm  ideacity  fox corp  and the procter gamble company 
we continue to be subject to a number of risks  including delays in product and service developments  competitive service offerings  lack of market acceptance  uncertainty of future profitability  dependence on third parties for manufacturing  marketing  and sales support  rollout schedules  software development issues  access to television programming  intellectual property claims against us  and our ability to sustain and grow our subscription base 
we conduct our operations through one reportable segment 
we anticipate that our business will continue to be seasonal and expect to generate a significant number of our annual new tivo owned subscriptions during and immediately after the holiday shopping season 
prior to the fiscal year ended january   we incurred significant losses and had substantial negative operating cash flow 
during the fiscal year ended january   our cash provided by our operations was million and we had a net income of million primarily due to receipts of damages and associated interest from our litigation against echostar 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
industry trends consumer demand is driving widespread adoption of dvr technology 
we believe dvrs offer a compelling value proposition to consumers by providing the means to effectively sort through  select from  and organize the growing volume of broadcast  cable  and broadband video content choices including television shows  movies  videos  songs  and photos 
dvr technology also gives consumers the ability to easily fast forward  pause  and rewind recorded video content 
today  approximately million households have dvrs  up from approximately million a year earlier and this is expected to increase to over million by according to snl kagan and higher by other accounts 

table of contents television distributors see dvr technology as a competitive asset 
nearly all of the major television distributors in the united states including comcast  directv  dish formerly echostar  time warner cable  and others  are offering dvr technology to their customers 
these companies have indicated they consider dvr technology a competitive tool to help differentiate their services by offering their customers more programming features 
these operators are looking for ways to more effectively attract and retain consumers to their own offerings and we believe that our unique user interface and software can help increase customer satisfaction and reduce churn for television distributors in the united states and beyond 
this is also a risk to our business to the extent that these companies view tivo as a competitive threat and economically harmful rather than a potential business partner 
dvr is expanding beyond the united states 
major television distributors and broadcasters outside of the united states are beginning to offer dvrs to their customers 
these companies are looking for ways to integrate television  dvr technology  and the ability to retrieve broadband content into one device 
today  there have been approximately million dvrs shipped globally and this number is expected to grow significantly according to emarketer 
dvr is changing the television advertising industry 
the proliferation of dvrs  and their ability to easily fast forward through television content  is requiring television advertisers to evaluate new and different ways to reach out to consumers 
the dvr in general and the tivo service specifically have given viewers the freedom to view video content when they want to view the content 
time shifting has made it more difficult for advertisers to be guaranteed that their commercials will be viewed by audiences at the regularly scheduled time the program is aired by network or local television stations 
dvrs allow viewers the freedom to fast forward through all or a portion of commercial advertising incorporated into television and other programs  which means that advertisers are not assured that their commercials will be viewed at all 
tivo offers other programming options  such as video delivered by broadband  which may result in further audience fragmentation 
broadband video is increasing television viewing options 
the growth in broadband video is providing television consumers with significantly more video options 
these increased viewing options are providing television consumers with more access to different forms of video content from providers other than traditional cable and satellite television program packages 
we expect dvr technology to be integral in providing television consumers with the ability to access  organize  and view television from both broadband and traditional television sources 
our solution we have created a unique set of technologies  products  and services that meet the needs of consumers  television distributors  and the advertising community 
our goal is to change the way consumers receive and watch television  broadband video  and advertising and to generate revenues through the deployment of our branded entertainment services and technology to television viewing households worldwide 
compelling  easy to use consumer dvr offering 
the tivo service  combined with a tivo enabled dvr  has an easy  intuitive user interface and many features that we believe dramatically improve a consumer s television viewing experience 
depending on the model  tivo enabled dvrs can support analog cable  digital cable  satellite  over the air broadcast television  and streaming and downloaded broadband video content  including standard definition and high definition television 
the tivo service enables consumers to watch tv on their own schedule by automatically finding and digitally recording their favorite shows  all season long  even if the schedule changes  and can even skip reruns 
the tivo service allows consumers to find new shows to watch through features that enable them to search for shows to record by subject  title  genre  actor  director  or channel 
the tivo service can also suggest shows consumers may like based on shows they are recording 
consumers can also pause and rewind live and recorded television 
unlike with a vcr  consumers can play back a show from its beginning while it is in the middle of being recorded  and consumers can play back a previously recorded show while recording another show 
increasingly differentiated features and service 
our goal is to lead the market with innovations that expand the value and potential of our subscription service 
we plan to continue to invest in innovation to improve consumer choice  convenience  and control over their home entertainment and to make the tivo service more compelling for both current and potential customers 
for example  we launched a service feature called tivo swivel search  which allows tivo users to discover content based on common actors  directors or genres of television shows and movies  and updated the feature in fiscal year to include additional content  including hd content 
we provide consumers with access to new interactive applications which include the ability to receive more content delivered to their tivo enabled dvrs over a broadband connection such as premium film and television content from amazon video on demand  netflix  and in the future blockbuster  and professionally produced program content from providers such as the new york times  cnet  and the nba  as well as millions of songs through music subscription service rhapsody 
we expect that a significant portion of our future product development efforts will be focused on broadband functionality as we believe that 
table of contents this area will bring the most significant enhancements to the tivo service in the areas of mobility  entertainment personalization  and broadcast broadband integration 
we also offer a set of unique features to service providers deploying the tivo service  to help them maximize the value of their service offerings to their subscribers 
these market leading features include powerful search and discovery capabilities that integrate not only regular linear television content but also video on demand content  including innovative means of highlighting hd content throughout the user interface 
the tivo application can be downloaded directly to certain existing cable operators set top boxes without the need for new hardware or a service call 
integrate our technology 
part of our strategy focuses on creating  developing  and deploying a software version of the tivo service that will be executable on certain third party dvr platforms in order to promote the mass deployment of devices capable of running the tivo service 
the current focus of this effort is primarily on cable television providers  which are deploying dvr s in increasing numbers 
we have announced partnerships with comcast and cox to deploy a software version of the tivo service to run on dvr hardware manufactured by a variety of set top box manufacturers 
during fiscal year  the tivo service on comcast launched in additional new england markets and based on comcast s public statements  we expect further comcast markets to deploy the tivo service in fiscal year cox is currently in trials in new england and we expect to begin initial deployment of their tivo enabled dvr solution during our fiscal year we also announced an extension of our directv partnership 
under the terms of this non exclusive arrangement  we expect to develop a version of the tivo service for directv s broadband enabled hd dvr for a launch to consumers as soon as possible in calendar year extend and protect our intellectual property 
the convenience  control  and ease of use of the tivo service is derived largely from the technology we have developed 
we intend to continue to design  develop  and implement innovative technological solutions that leverage and enhance the tivo service offering 
we have adopted a proactive patent and trademark strategy designed to protect and extend our technology and intellectual property 
extend tivo product beyond us market 
we believe there is a large opportunity to leverage the tivo service and technology outside the united states 
for example  we have a distribution agreement with cablevision mexico  which is owned by televisa  to provide a spanish language version of the tivo service to digital cable subscribers in mexico city  and hybrid television services  a subsidiary of seven networks in australia  which is selling a dvb t version of tivo  and litv in taiwan who is selling a broadband bundled cable offering through its tgc taiwan subsidiary 
we currently have solutions that integrate broadband offerings for cable  satellite  and over the air television distributors and we expect to consider additional international partnerships and distribution agreements over the next year in these markets 
increase advertising capabilities and revenue 
we offer interactive advertising capabilities to advertisers  advertising agencies  and broadcast networks 
our advertising products include detailed reporting on actual viewing and screen by screen interaction by consumers 
we offer our advertisers compelling interactive products such as branded showcases including long form video  requests for information  and customizable applications such as car configurators 
we also offer the ability to enhance existing television commercials with interactive tags  enabling consumers to pause television and explore additional advertising content 
we plan to continue developing and enhancing these offerings  which take advantage of the unique tagging  recording  storage  and viewing capabilities of the tivo service 
some of our key advertisers and advertising agencies include grey sf  toyota motors  warner brothers  universal mccann  omd  mediaedge  mediastorm  ideacity  fox corp  and the procter gamble company 
increase audience research capabilities and revenue 
we offer advertisers  advertising agencies and television networks second by second reporting on television program and commercial viewership in our subscribers homes 
we make this available via two primary products  stop watch ratings service which is based on an anonymous  aggregate nightly sample of  tivo subscribers which is expected to increase to  by the fall of  and power watch which is based on a panel of  tivo subscribers who have volunteered to participate in this on going research project and have opted in to allow viewership to be associated with their set top boxes and  on an anonymous aggregated basis  various characteristics of their household which they have provided to us 
we plan to continue developing and enhancing these offerings by using the viewing data already available to us to present deeper insights into how dvr households consume television content 
our technology tivo has developed a technology portfolio that makes the tivo service available on a standalone retail dvr product line that receives over the air digital signals and is cablecard tm ready  on the integrated set top boxes of a major satellite television provider  directv  through software downloads on set top boxes for cable television providers comcast and in the future cox  and through over the air standard dvb t in australia and in the future new zealand 
we anticipate making the tivo service available on set top boxes of additional television service providers in the future 
tivo s technology for enabling the tivo service includes the tivo service client software platform  the tivo service infrastructure  and tivo enabled dvr hardware design 

table of contents tivo service client software 
the tivo service client software runs on tivo enabled dvrs 
it consists of operational software required for a tivo enabled dvr to deliver the tivo service 
the software includes system components such as a media oriented file system  a high performance transactional database  an integrated security system  and application components such as media management and user interface 
we have enhanced the client software to support multiple services and applications  such as receipt of broadband video content  digital music and photos 
the tivo client software manages interaction with the tivo service infrastructure 
after the initial set up of the tivo service  the tivo enabled dvr will automatically connect to the tivo service infrastructure over a dial up or broadband connection to download the program guide data  client software upgrades  showcases  and other content 
we are currently extending the tivo service client software to enable future deployment on certain commonly used integrated dvr set top boxes 
under the terms of our agreement with comcast  for example  comcast has made the tivo service available as a software upgrade to its already installed base of certain motorola dvrs in new england  currently  and additional regions in the future and in the future on certain cisco dvrs 
we also intend to extend the tivo service to run on other dvr set top boxes capable of supporting comcast deployed middleware and forthcoming open cable application platform ocap solutions 
tivo service infrastructure 
the tivo service infrastructure enables the ongoing operation of the tivo service  managing the distribution of proprietary services  and specialized content such as program guide data  interactive advertising  and tivo client software upgrades 
it interfaces with our billing and customer support systems for service authorization and bug tracking 
in addition  the tivo service infrastructure collects anonymous viewing information uploaded from tivo enabled dvrs for use in our audience research measurement efforts 
the infrastructure has also been designed to work with the networks of service provider customers  for example  by utilizing directv s satellite bandwidth to deliver data to directv receivers with tivo service 
tivo enabled dvr hardware design 
the tivo enabled dvr hardware design is a specification developed by tivo for set top boxes containing a hard disk drive  a cpu and memory  digital video chips  a modem  and other components 
we provide this design to our contract manufacturer that produces tivo branded dvrs 
the dvr hardware design has been integrated into a variety of products including standalone tivo service dvrs  directv receivers  dvd players  and dvd recorders 
the tivo enabled dvr hardware design includes a modular front end that allows the basic platform to be used for digital and analog broadcast  digital and analog cable  and satellite applications 
in addition  certain designs include usb ports to allow connection to broadband networks and external devices to enable existing and future services 
a tivo enabled dvr without a subscription to the tivo service has minimal functionality 
significant relationships comcast 
on march   we entered into a non exclusive licensing and marketing agreement with entities affiliated with comcast corporation 
pursuant to this agreement  we agreed to develop a tivo branded software solution for deployment on comcast s dvr platforms  which would enable the tivo user interface and dvr application  which includes features  such as wishlist and season pass 
in addition  we agreed to develop an advertising management system for deployment on comcast platforms to enable the provision of local and national advertising to comcast subscribers 
the initial term of this agreement expires on june  the agreement  as amended  provides comcast with eight additional one year renewal terms beyond the initial term  with certain deployment thresholds moved from june  to the renewal term beginning after june  comcast will pay a recurring monthly fee per comcast household which receives the tivo service through comcast 
comcast has also paid us fees for licensing the tivo technology  and will continue to pay us fees for engineering services for the development and integration of the tivo service software solution subject to adjustment under certain circumstances and will also pay us for the advertising management system 
under the initial and subsequent statements of work with comcast  subject to the attainment of specified deployment thresholds  comcast is entitled to recoup over time certain development fees paid to us through a mechanism effectively resulting in a reduction of certain subscription fees 
additionally  comcast has an option to purchase software maintenance and support 
comcast is entitled to a credit redeemable for ongoing development work that is based on a percentage of certain fees received by tivo under the arrangement 
comcast will pay for any ongoing development work that exceeds the amount of the credit 
tivo will have the continuing right to sell certain types of advertising on the tivo service offered through comcast 
tivo will also have a limited right to sell certain types of advertising on other comcast platforms enabled with the tivo advertising management system  when such advertising features are developed  subject to comcast s option to terminate such right in exchange for certain advertising related payments 

table of contents as part of this agreement  comcast received a non exclusive  non transferable license to our intellectual property in order to deploy the tivo service software solution and advertising management system  including certain trademark branding rights and a covenant not to assert under tivo s patents  which rights extend only to comcast corporation  its affiliates  and certain of its vendors and suppliers with respect to comcast products and services 
such non exclusive  non transferable license to the company s intellectual property will  under certain circumstances  continue after the termination of this agreement 
in addition  comcast is entitled to certain most favored customer terms as compared with other multi channel video distributors who license certain tivo technology 
pursuant to the terms of this agreement  comcast has the right to terminate the agreement in the event the company is the subject of certain change of control transactions involving any of certain specified companies 
the tivo service software solution has launched in its initial market  the new england region 
we expect the tivo service to be launched in additional markets in fiscal  beginning with chicago 
comcast accepted the tivo advertising management system in fiscal  and deployment of the advertising management system is expected in the future though no date has been set 
directv 
directv is the largest provider of satellite television in the us we have had a longstanding relationship with directv from to the present to provide the tivo service to its customer base 
as of january   we had approximately million subscriptions through this relationship 
in the fiscal year ended january   we reported million of directv related revenues  which include subscription revenues  directv related advertising revenues  and revenues from engineering services provided to directv 
this represented of our total net revenues 
directv currently pays us a recurring monthly per household fee for access to the technology needed to provide its customers the tivo service 
we incur limited recurring expenses 
we also recognize revenue from directv for engineering services work on integrated directv satellite receivers with tivo service and the related service infrastructure 
we are continuing to provide directv with engineering services related to currently installed hardware and updates and feature enhancements for existing platforms and customers 
additionally  directv distributes features that enable advanced automatic recording capabilities and the delivery of promotional video to directv receivers with tivo service 
subject to certain restrictions and exceptions  both directv and tivo may sell advertising and audience research measurement data  with each party retaining all their respective revenues generated from such sales 
directv currently does not have the right to continue to distribute directv receivers with tivo service to new customers 
instead  directv has been offering a new dvr to compete with the existing directv receivers with tivo service 
additionally  directv has added high definition programming in a format that is not compatible with the existing tivo enabled high definition dvrs previously distributed by directv 
as a result  we have seen a reduction in the number of directv receivers with tivo service subscriptions  a trend that we expect to continue 
on september   the company extended its current agreement with directv for the development  marketing  and distribution of a new hd directv dvr featuring the tivo service 
under the terms of this non exclusive arrangement  tivo expects to develop a version of the tivo service for directv s broadband enabled hd dvr for a launch to consumers as soon as possible in calendar year directv  upon deployment of the hd directv dvrs with tivo service  is entitled to recoup  over time  a portion of certain development fees through a reduction in certain subscription fees 
the new agreement also extends the mutual covenant not to sue with respect to each company s products and services throughout the term of the new agreement 
under this new agreement  directv will pay a substantially higher monthly fee for households using the new hd directv dvrs with tivo when and if the new version of the tivo service is deployed than the fees for previously deployed directv dvrs with tivo service 
directv will continue to pay the current monthly fee for all households using only the previously deployed directv dvrs with tivo service 
the fees paid by directv are subject to monthly minimum payments that escalate during the term of the agreement starting in and those minimum payments are substantially higher than in the prior agreement 
the company will continue to defer a portion of these fees as a non refundable credit to fund mutually agreed development  with excess development work to be funded by directv 
directv also has certain additional annual obligations to market and promote the new hd directv dvr featuring the tivo service once it has launched 
cox 
on august   we entered into a non exclusive licensing and distribution agreement with cox communications otherwise referred to as cox 
pursuant to the agreement  we have agreed to develop a tivo branded software solution for deployment on cox s dvr platforms  which would enable cox to offer our dvr and advertising software to its customers and advertising clients respectively 
in addition  we have agreed to develop an advertising management system for deployment on cox platforms to enable the provision of local and national advertising to cox subscribers 

table of contents the initial term of our agreement is for five years from completion of the tivo service software solution  but no longer than seven years after the effective date of the agreement 
during the term of the agreement  we will provide cox with certain customer support and maintenance services 
we will have the continuing right to sell certain types of advertising in connection with our service offered through cox 
we will also have a right to sell certain types of advertising on other cox dvr set top boxes enabled with the advertising management system 
as part of the agreement  cox is receiving a non exclusive  non transferable license to specific tivo intellectual property to deploy the tivo service software solution and advertising management system  including certain trademark branding rights 
cox will also reimburse us for the cost of certain third party license fees 
in addition  cox may be entitled to certain most favored customer terms if we enter into future agreements with multi channel video distributors whose commitment to deploy our dvrs and advertising software is less than cox s commitment 
cox has the right to terminate the agreement in the event we are the subject of certain change of control transactions involving any of certain specified companies 
cox is in trials and we currently expect the tivo service on cox to launch in its initial markets during the first half of fiscal year sales and marketing consumer offerings 
we sell subscriptions to the tivo service directly to consumers who have purchased a tivo enabled dvr 
we currently sell tivo service only subscriptions either for a monthly subscription rate of up to per month with discounts available to subscribers who have multiple subscriptions to the tivo service  or a pre pay option of for one year  for three years of tivo service  or for product lifetime service for existing customers who have at least one other qualifying subscription 
tivo enabled dvrs are available from major retailers across the united states  including best buy 
to drive sales while managing costs  we have shared marketing expenses with key retailers  and in some cases  we have offered to share a portion of the subscription revenues 
we currently manufacture and sell three models of tivo enabled dvrs  the standard definition tivo series dt dual tuner  the high definition tivo hd dvr  and the high definition tivo hd xl dvr which retail for   and  respectively 
services to television service providers 
we also sell our technology and services to television service providers  such as comcast  directv  and cox who then market or in the case directv and cox  plan to market in the future the tivo service to their subscribers 
services to the advertising industry 
we also sell advertising and audience research measurement services  through a dedicated team of salespeople and through partnerships with third parties like iri and nbcu 
customer service and support for our tivo owned standalone dvrs  we provide customer support through outsourced service providers as well as our internal customer service personnel 
for our directv receivers with tivo service  directv is primarily responsible for customer support 
comcast and  when launched  cox are primarily responsible for customer support for their subscribers to the tivo service 
we provide training and other assistance to comcast and cox 
individual customers have access to an internet based repository for technical information and troubleshooting techniques 
they also can obtain support through other means such as the tivo website  web forums  email  and telephone support 
we offer a manufacturer s warranty on the dvrs tivo manufacturers which enable our tivo owned subscriptions of days for labor and one year for parts 
for our direct sales that include both a tivo owned standalone dvr and a subscription to our service other than product lifetime subscriptions  we extend such manufacturer s warranty for parts only for the duration of the initial subscription which may last as long as three years 
we contract with third parties to handle warranty repair 
research and product development our research and development efforts are focused on designing and developing the components necessary to enable the tivo service 
these activities include both hardware and software development 
fiscal year ended january  tivo inc in millions research and development expenses we decreased the number of our regular  temporary  and part time employees engaged in research and development by from a total of as of january  to as of january  
table of contents manufacturing and supply chain we outsource the manufacturing of our products to third party manufacturers 
this outsourcing extends from prototyping to volume manufacturing and includes activities such as material procurement  final assembly  test  quality control  and shipment to distribution centers 
today the majority of our products are assembled in mexico 
our primary distribution center is operated on an outsourced basis in texas 
the components that make up our products are purchased from various vendors  including key suppliers such as broadcom  which supplies system controllers 
some of our components  including system controllers  chassis  remote controls  and certain discrete components are currently supplied by sole source suppliers 
we often require substantial lead time to purchase components and manufacture anticipated quantities of dvrs that enable the tivo service 
this long lead time requires us to make component purchasing and inventory decisions well in advance of our peak selling periods 
we offer our individual end users who purchase from tivo 
com a day money back guarantee 
we typically do not offer a right of return or significant extended payment terms to our retailers 
seasonality sales of our dvrs and subscriptions to the tivo service are affected by seasonality 
thus  we generate a significant number of our annual dvr sales and new subscriptions during and immediately after the holiday shopping season with associated increases in revenue 
we also incur significant increases in expenses in the second half of the year related to hardware costs  revenue share and other payments to channel  and sales and marketing  subscription acquisition costs in anticipation of the holiday shopping season 
there is less seasonality associated with our msos broadcasters  which includes relationships with companies such as directv and comcast 
competition we believe that the principal competitive factors in the dvr market are brand recognition and awareness  functionality  ease of use  availability  and pricing 
we currently see two primary categories of dvr competitors dvrs offered by satellite  cable  and telecommunications operators and dvrs offered by consumer electronics and software companies 
satellite  cable  and telecommunications dvr competitors 
we compete against cable and satellite set top boxes that integrate dvr functionality 
these products often combine digital and analog receptions with dvr functionality  some versions offer dual turner and or high definition capabilities 
satellite dish formerly echostar offers a range of dvr models  including standard definition and high definition models  most of which offer dual tuner capabilities 
certain models can output signals to multiple tvs within the household 
additionally  dish has spent a significant amount of capital advertising and promoting its dvr as better than tivo 
further  dish offered its dvr at lower monthly service fees than tivo and most other television providers 
directv has introduced a dvr technology including both standard definition and high definition broadcasts 
cable cable operators have made dvr technology available on set top boxes such as from scientific atlanta owned by cisco and motorola 
other competition in the cable dvr market comes from other software providers including tv guide  microsoft  aptiv  digital  and digeo 
us cable operators are currently deploying server based video on demand vod technology from seachange  concurrent  and others  which could potentially evolve into competition 
additionally  we are aware of at least one us cable operator  cablevision  inc  which stated a desire to test server based dvr technology  in the future if legally permissible 
to the extent that cable operators offer regular television programming as part of their server based vod offerings and dvr technology  consumers have an alternate means of watching time shifted shows besides dvrs 
telecommunications telecommunications operators have deployed dvr technology in connection with the provision of television services to consumers either in partnership with other television providers  such as verizon s fios service  at t s u verse service or through partnerships with directv qwest  verizon  at t 
consumer electronics competitors 
we compete against several types of products with basic time slot based recordings or enhanced electronic program guide epg based dvr functionality offered by consumer electronics companies 
these products record a television signal output from a cable  satellite  or antenna  including internationally through digital over the air standards such as dvb t 

table of contents standalone dvrs and hard drive equipped dvd recorders  tvs  and game consoles several consumer electronics companies  including panasonic and sony  produce dvd recorders with hard drives 
in addition  several consumer electronics companies have television products that are internet enabled  allowing them to access content and applications from various sources 
some of these tvs offer cablecard functionality  allowing the receipt of encrypted digital cable programming without the need for a digital cable set top box 
in general  these hard drive equipped dvd recorders and tvs do not require dvr service fees and offer basic dvr functionality 
in the future  companies such as sony and microsoft could incorporate dvr technology into their video game consoles  and microsoft has now enabled the digital delivery of video programming over the internet to its game console 
personal computers with dvr software microsoft s windows xp media center and vista editions contain expanded digital media features including enhanced dvr functionality 
pc manufacturers including dell and hewlett packard offer pcs running this microsoft software and other pc manufacturers such as apple computer may offer similar functionality in the future 
additionally  software programs such as mythtv and snapstream can be loaded onto a personal computer to provide enhanced dvr functionality 
tivo does offer a software only version of the tivo service called nero liquidtv tm tivo pc 
licensing competitors 
our licensing revenues depend upon both our ability to successfully negotiate licensing agreements with our consumer electronics and service provider customers and  in turn  upon our customers successful commercialization of their underlying products 
in addition  we face competition from companies such as microsoft  gemstar  opentv  nds  d m holdings  digeo  gotuit  and wire  which have created competing digital video recording technologies 
such companies may offer more economically attractive licensing agreements to service providers and manufacturers of dvrs 
established competition for advertising budgets 
digital video recorder services  in general  and tivo  specifically  compete with other advertising media such as print  radio  television  video on demand  internet  and other emerging advertising platforms for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers do not perceive digital video recording services  in general  and tivo specifically  as an effective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to advertise on the tivo service 
in addition  advertisers may not support or embrace the tivo technology due to a belief that our technology s ability to fast forward through commercials will reduce the effectiveness of general television advertising 
audience research competitors 
we compete with advertising research companies such as nielsen  tns  and rentrak for research spend from advertisers  advertising agencies  and television networks 
these companies have all announced intentions to provide second by second viewership information based on data from digital cable set top boxes and satellite set top boxes 
the type of research we provide is a discretionary purchase 
if advertisers  advertising agencies  and television networks perceive the information provided by these companies to be more valuable  they may invest in those services rather than ours  or they may choose not to purchase this type of information at all 
patents and intellectual property we have filed patent applications relating to many critical aspects of the design  functionality  and operation of tivo products and services 
we have been awarded approximately foreign and domestic patents and have approximately foreign and domestic patent applications pending 
we have also filed patent applications related to technology that we may incorporate in future versions of our products and services 
patents we hold the rights to include us patent number  entitled method and apparatus implementing random access and time based functions on a continuous stream of formatted digital data  originally filed on april   which describes a method of controlling streaming media in a digital device  including the functions that enable dvrs to pause live tv as well as rewind  fast forward  play  play faster  play slower  and play in reverse television signals cached by the dvr 
we refer to this as the trickplay patent 
the expiration date of the trickplay patent is april  us patent number  entitled method and apparatus implementing random access and time based functions on a continuous stream of formatted digital data  which is a continuation of the trickplay patent 
the expiration date of this patent is likewise april  us patent  entitled multimedia time warping system  originally filed on july   which describes many of the key inventions associated with the tivo enabled dvr software and hardware design 
we refer to this as the timewarp patent 
key inventions claimed in the patent include a method for recording one program while playing back another or watching a program as it is recording  often referred to as time shifting the program  a method for efficient and low cost processing and synchronizing of the various multimedia streams in a television signal such as video  audio  and closed captioning  and a storage format that easily supports advanced trickplay capabilities 
the expiration date of the timewarp patent is july  
table of contents tivo has also acquired the exclusive right to license and enforce us patent number  entitled variable delay video recorder known in the industry as the goldwasser patent 
filed in march  the goldwasser patent is one of the earliest patents regarding digital video recorders of which we are aware 
this patent covers devices that permit the simultaneous recording and playback of video material with a variable time delay between recording and playback of a given video program segment 
the expiration date of the goldwasser patent is march  we have also purchased foreign and domestic patents and foreign patent applications from international business machines corporation  or ibm 
these patents and patent applications generally relate to audience research measurement  integration of television signals with internet access  automatic rescheduling of recordings  content screening  enhanced program information search  and electronic program guide interface enhancements 
additionally  on september   we entered into a patent cross license agreement with ibm  under which we paid certain cash consideration to ibm  and each party granted to the other a non exclusive  worldwide  royalty free license to such party s patents that are entitled to a priority date on or before september   including all patents and patent applications in existence as of that date with limited exceptions 
the license granted by ibm to us extends to all products other than general purpose data processing products and data storage devices that are primarily sold separately from other hardware 
the license that we granted to ibm extends to all products  other than digital media recorders and digital media recorder software 
no license was granted  directly or by implication  to permit the combination of any product with any other item 
tivo has secured numerous trademark registrations for its distinctive marks  including but not limited to registrations  for the marks tivo  the tivo logo  season pass  thumbs logos  and certain sound marks 
pending trademark applications include  but are not limited to  stopllwatch  mevo  and mivo 
additionally  we have international trademark applications pending for several of these trademarks 
we anticipate ongoing progress in our establishment of a defensible and useful intellectual property portfolio  however  we cannot assure you that current patents will be enforceable or our current patent applications will ever be allowed or granted 
see part i  item a  risk factors our success depends on our ability to secure and protect our patents  trademarks  and other proprietary rights and pending intellectual property litigation for additional information concerning our intellectual property 
privacy policy we have adopted a privacy policy  which we make available on our website at www 
tivo 
com privacy and deliver to each new subscriber to the tivo service 
this policy was last updated in august to cover new features that we have introduced and plan to introduce in the future 
this policy explains that we collect certain types of information such as anonymous viewing and diagnostic information  but all viewing information that is linked or associated with an individual identity will not be disclosed without the viewer s affirmative consent 
we further give subscribers the ability to opt out from the collection of anonymous viewing information and diagnostic information log files 
we have designed a system that ensures that any viewing information transmitted from a tivo enabled dvr is anonymous and remains unidentifiable to a particular viewer known as anonymous viewing information  unless that subscriber affirmatively consents to such identification before any viewing data leaves the dvr 
anonymous viewing information is collected separately from any information that identifies a viewer personally 
as a result  we may be able to use this anonymous information to tell a broadcast or advertising client the percentage of our viewers that recorded a particular program or advertisement  but we will not know  nor be able to tell the client  which of our viewers did so  unless a viewer decides to provide that information 
employees at march   we employed approximately employees  including in service operations  in research and development  in sales and marketing  and in general and administration 
we also employ  from time to time  a number of temporary and part time employees as well as consultants on a contract basis 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract  train  retain  and motivate highly qualified employees 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike 
our management considers employee relations to be good

item a 
risk factors we have incurred significant net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability 
prior to the fiscal year ended january   we incurred significant net losses and had substantial negative cash flows 
during the fiscal years ended january    and  our net income losses were million  million  and million  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended january   our cash provided by our operations was million and we had a net income of million 
the net income and cash provided by operations for the fiscal year ended january  reflects million in litigation proceeds received from echostar 
this amount was recorded as million in litigation proceeds within the operating expenses section of the consolidated statement of operations and million in interest income 
additionally  we recorded million in tax expense related to the receipt of these monies 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the size of future net losses will depend in part on our subscription revenues and on our expenses 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve sustained profitability 
we face intense competition from a number of sources  which may impair our revenues  increase our subscription acquisition cost  and hinder our ability to generate new subscriptions 
the dvr market is rapidly evolving  and we face significant competition 
moreover  the market for in home entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
as a result of this intense competition  we could incur increased subscription acquisition costs that could adversely affect our ability to reach or sustain profitability in the future 
if new technologies render the dvr market obsolete  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 

table of contents we believe that the principal competitive factors in the dvr market are brand recognition and awareness  functionality  ease of use  availability  and pricing 
we currently see two primary categories of dvr competitors dvrs offered by telecommunications  cable and satellite operators and dvrs offered by consumer electronics and software companies 
for more information on our competitors  see our discussion on competition in item business 
licensing competitors 
our licensing revenues depend both upon our ability to successfully negotiate licensing agreements with our consumer electronics and service provider customers and  in turn  upon our customers successful commercialization of their underlying products 
we face competition from companies such as microsoft  gemstar  opentv  nds  directv  echostar  pace  digeo  motorola  cisco  gotuit  and wire  which have created competing digital video recording technologies 
such companies may offer more economically attractive licensing agreements to service providers and manufacturers of dvrs 
established competition for advertising budgets 
digital video recorder services  in general  and tivo  specifically  compete with other advertising media such as print  radio  television  internet  video on demand  and other emerging advertising platforms for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers do not perceive digital video recording services  in general  and tivo specifically  as an effective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to advertise on the tivo service 
in addition  advertisers may not support or embrace the tivo technology due to a belief that our technology s ability to fast forward through commercials will reduce the effectiveness of general television advertising 
we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture  distribute  and supply critical components  assemblies  and services for the dvrs that enable the tivo service 
we may be unable to operate our business if these parties do not perform their obligations 
the tivo service is enabled through the use of a dvr manufactured for us by a third party contract manufacturer 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of key components for the dvrs 
we also rely on third parties with whom we outsource supply chain activities related to inventory warehousing  order fulfillment  distribution  and other direct sales logistics 
we cannot be sure that these parties will perform their obligations as expected or that any revenue  cost savings  or other benefits will be derived from the efforts of these parties 
if any of these parties breaches or terminates their agreement with us or otherwise fails to perform their obligations in a timely manner  we may be delayed or prevented from commercializing our products and services 
because our relationships with these parties are non exclusive  they may also support products and services that compete directly with us  or offer similar or greater support to our competitors 
any of these events could require us to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote additional resources to commercialize our products and services 
this outcome would harm our ability to compete effectively and achieve increased market acceptance and brand recognition 
in addition  we face the following risks in relying on these third parties if our manufacturing relationships are not successful  we may be unable to satisfy demand for our products and services 
we manufacture dvrs that enable the tivo service through a third party contract manufacturer 
delays  product shortages  and other problems could impair our retail distribution and brand image and make it difficult for us to attract subscriptions 
in addition  the loss of a manufacturer would require us to identify and contract with alternative sources of manufacturing  which we may be unable to do or which could prove time consuming and expensive 
we are dependent on sole suppliers for several key components and services 
if these suppliers fail to perform their obligations  we may be unable to find alternative suppliers or deliver our products and services to our customers on time 
we currently rely on sole suppliers for a number of the key components used in the tivo enabled dvrs and the tivo service 
for example  broadcom is the sole supplier of the system controller for our dvr 
we do not currently have a long term written supply agreement with broadcom 
therefore  broadcom may not be contractually obligated to supply us with these key components on a long term basis or at all 
in addition to the above  we have several sole suppliers for key components of our products currently under development  although it is currently anticipated that those will be provided under signed supply agreements 
tribune is the sole supplier of the program guide data for the tivo service 
tribune media services  inc  or tribune  is the current sole supplier of program guide data for the tivo service 
our current television listings data agreement with tribune became effective on may  and has an initial term of five years and with tivo having the right to renew the agreement for four additional years 
the agreement provides each party with a termination right if the other party becomes controlled by certain third parties 
tribune media services  along with their parent company  tribune co  filed chapter bankruptcy on december  as a result  tribune or tribune media services  inc could reject the television listing data agreement and we would be left will an unsecured claim in tribune s bankruptcy 
if tribune 
table of contents breaches its obligation to provide us with data  rejects the agreement or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under our agreement  we would be unable to provide certain aspects of the tivo service to our customers 
we may be unable to secure an alternate source of guide data on acceptable terms 
if our arrangements with broadcom or tribune or with our third party contract manufacturer were to terminate or expire without a replacement arrangement in place  or if we or our manufacturers were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components or required program guide data from our suppliers  our search for alternate suppliers could result in significant delays  added expense or disruption in product or service availability 
we depend upon third parties to provide supply chain services related to inventory management  order fulfillment  and direct sales logistics 
we rely on third party vendors to provide cost effective and efficient supply chain services 
among other activities  these outsourced services relate to direct sales logistics  including order fulfillment  inventory management and warehousing  and distribution of inventory to third party retailers 
if one or several of our third party supply chain partners were to discontinue services for us  our ability to fulfill direct sales orders and distribute inventory timely  cost effectively  or at all  would be hindered which could in turn harm our business 
we are dependent on our major retail partners for distribution of our products to consumers 
we currently rely on our relationships with major retail distributors including best buy  and others for distribution of tivo enabled dvrs 
we do not typically enter into long term volume commitments with our major retail distributors 
if one or several of our major retail partners were to discontinue selling our products  the volume of tivo enabled dvrs sold to consumers could decrease which could in turn harm our business 
intellectual property claims against us could be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
from time to time  we receive letters from third parties alleging that we are infringing on their intellectual property 
regardless of their merit  we are forced to devote time and resources to respond to these letters 
in addition  if any of these third parties or others were to sue us  our business could be harmed because intellectual property litigation may be time consuming and expensive  divert management s attention and resources away from our business  cause delays in product delivery and new service introduction  cause the cancellation of current or future products or services  or require us to pay significant royalties and or licensing fees 
the emerging enhanced television industry is highly litigious 
additionally  many patents covering interactive television technologies have been granted but have not been commercialized 
a number of companies in the enhanced television industry earn substantial profits from technology licensing  and the introduction of new technologies such as ours is likely to provoke lawsuits from such companies 
a successful claim of infringement against us  our inability to obtain an acceptable license from the holder of the patent or other right  or our inability to design around an asserted patent or other right could cause our manufacturers to cease manufacturing dvrs that enable the tivo service  our retailers to stop selling the product or us to cease providing our service  or all of the above  which would eliminate our ability to generate revenues 
under our agreements with many of our manufacturing and licensing partners  we are obligated to indemnify them in the event that our technology infringes upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
due to these indemnity obligations  we could be forced to incur material expenses if our manufacturing and licensing partners are sued 
if they were to lose the lawsuit  our business could be harmed 
in addition  because the products sold by our manufacturing and licensing partners often involve the use of other persons technology  this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted against the product in question  even if the claim does not pertain to our technology 
for example  on april   echostar technologies corporation filed a complaint against tivo and humax usa  inc in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging infringement of us patent nos 
 interruption tolerant video program viewing   b multimedia direct access storage device and formatting method   b multimedia direct access storage device and formatting method and  b method and system for recording in progress broadcast programs 
the complaint alleges that tivo and humax have infringed  contributorily infringed and or actively induced infringement of the patents by making  using  selling or importing digital video recording devices  digital video recording device software and or personal television services in the united states 
table of contents that allegedly infringe the patents  and that such infringement is willful and ongoing 
under the terms of our agreement with humax governing the distribution of certain dvrs that enable the tivo service  we are required to indemnify humax against any claims  damages  liabilities  costs  and expenses relating to claims that our technology infringes upon intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we intend to defend this action vigorously  however  we are incurring expenses in connection with this lawsuit  which could become material in the future  and in the event there is an adverse outcome  our business could be harmed 
for a complete description of this lawsuit  please see our discussion under item legal proceedings 
pending intellectual property litigations 
we are subject to a number of pending intellectual property litigations 
we intend to defend these actions vigorously  however we could be forced to incur material expenses in connection with these lawsuits and or as a result of our indemnification obligations and  in the event there is an adverse outcome in any of these cases  our business could be harmed 
for more information on our pending intellectual property litigations  please see our discussion under item legal proceedings 
we have filed a patent infringement lawsuit against echostar communications corporation 
we are incurring significant expenses as a result  and an adverse outcome in the lawsuit could harm our business 
on january   we filed a complaint against echostar communications corporation ecc in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging willful and deliberate infringement of us patent no 
 entitled multimedia time warping system 
on january   we amended our complaint to add echostar dbs corporation  echostar technologies corporation  and echosphere limited liability corporation as additional defendants 
we allege that we are the owner of this patent and further allege that the defendants have willfully and deliberately infringed this patent by making  selling  offering to sell and or selling digital video recording devices  digital video recording device software  and or personal television services in the united states 
on april   the jury rendered a verdict in our favor for the amount of approximately million dollars 
on january   the us court of appeals for the federal circuit in washington  dc unanimously ruled in favor of tivo inc in connection with echostar s appeal of the district court judgment of patent infringement against echostar with respect to several claims so called software claims of the patent  upholding the full award of damages from the district court  and ordering that the stay of the district court s injunction against echostar s infringing digital video recorders that was issued pending appeal will dissolve when the appeal becomes final 
on april   the federal circuit denied echostar s combined petition for a panel rehearing and en banc rehearing of the federal circuit s denial of their appeal of the district court s judgment 
on october   the supreme court denied echostar s writ of certiorari 
on october   the company received million from echostar 
on february   the us district court held a contempt hearing in connection with echostar s alleged work around of the company s patent 
we continue to incur material expenses in connection with this lawsuit 
for a complete description of this lawsuit  please see our discussion under item legal proceedings 
digital video recorders could be the subject of future regulation relating to copyright law or evolving industry standards and practices that could adversely impact our business 
in the future  copyright statutes or case law could be changed to adversely impact our business by restricting the ability of consumers to temporally or spatially shift copyrighted materials for their own personal use 
our business could be harmed as a result 
in addition  we are aware that some media companies may attempt to form organizations to develop standards and practices in the digital video recorder industry 
these organizations or individual media companies may attempt to require companies in the digital video recorder industry to obtain copyright or other licenses 
lawsuits or other actions taken by these types of organizations or companies could make it more difficult for us to introduce new services  delay widespread consumer acceptance of our products and services  restrict our use of some television content  increase our costs  and adversely affect our business 
a significant part of our installed subscription base results from our relationship with directv which we expect to continue to decrease in the future due to directv s on going support of a competing dvrs 
although we are working with directv to develop a new high definition dvr with tivo for directv for launch in the future  directv does not currently have the right to manufacture and distribute tivo dvrs to directv subscribers 
as a result of this and directv s support of a competing dvr we expect the number of our directv with tivo subscriptions to continue to decrease in the future 
as a consequence of the loss of these future revenues from these directv subscribers with tivo service subscriptions  our business may be harmed 

table of contents we face risks in connection with our amended development and services agreements with directv for the development and deployment of a new hd directv dvr featuring the tivo service 
we may encounter delays in development under our new agreement with directv 
under the terms of our non exclusive arrangement  we are working with directv and its suppliers to develop a version of the tivo service for directv s broadband enabled hd dvr platform to deliver the new hd directv dvr with tivo service to directv for a launch to consumers as soon as possible in calendar year we may face significant technological  third party supplier and other challenges in our development of the tivo service for directv s broadband enabled hd dvr platform  any of which could delay or prevent us from delivering the new product 
if we are unable to successfully develop this new broadband enabled hd dvr with tivo service for deployment by directv  we would not be able to acquire new subscribers from directv under these new agreements and our business could be harmed 
it may be difficult for us or investors to evaluate trends and other factors that affect our business due to the rapidly evolving and highly competitive nature of the dvr services product category 
dvr services are a rapidly evolving and highly competitive product category and it may be difficult to predict the future growth rate  if any  or size of the market  for our products and services 
we may be unable to accurately forecast customer behavior and recognize or respond to emerging trends  changing preferences or competitive factors facing us 
as a result  we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts and adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
such inability could cause our net losses in a given quarter to be greater than expected  which could cause the price of our stock to decline 
it may be difficult to predict accurately our future revenues  costs of revenues  expenses  or results of operations 
in addition  any evaluation of our business must be made in light of the risks and difficulties encountered by companies offering products or services in new  rapidly evolving  and highly competitive markets 
we face a number of competitive challenges in the sale and marketing of the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
our success depends upon the successful retail marketing of the tivo service and related dvrs  which began in the third quarter of calendar year we compete with other consumer electronics products and home entertainment services for consumer spending 
dvrs and the tivo service compete in markets that are crowded with other consumer electronics products and home entertainment services 
the competition for consumer spending is intense  and many consumers on limited budgets may choose other products and services over ours 
dvrs compete for consumer spending with products such as dvd players  satellite television systems  personal computers  and video game consoles 
the tivo service competes with home entertainment services such as cable and satellite television  movie rentals  pay per view  video on demand  and mail order dvd services 
see also we face intense competition from a number of sources  which may impair our revenues  increase our subscription acquisition cost  and hinder our ability to generate new subscriptions 
many of these products or services have established markets  broad user bases  and proven consumer acceptance 
in addition  many of the manufacturers and distributors of these competing devices and services have substantially greater brand recognition  market presence  distribution channels  advertising and marketing budgets and promotional activities  and other strategic partners 
faced with this competition  we may be unable to effectively differentiate our dvrs and the tivo service from other consumer electronics devices or entertainment services 
we compete with digital cable  satellite  and telecommunications dvrs 
cable  satellite  and telecommunications service providers are accelerating deployment of integrated cable and satellite receivers with dvrs that bundle dvr services with other digital services and do not require their customers to purchase hardware 
if we are not able to enter into agreements with these service providers to embed the tivo service into their offerings  our ability to attract their subscribers to the tivo service would be limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in the future  we may also compete with digital cable  satellite  and telecommunications services that provide consumers with dvr services via a network connection on an on demand basis 
we are aware of at least one us cable operator  cablevision  inc  which has stated a desire to test server based dvr technology  in the future if legally permissible 
to the extent that cable  satellite  or telecommunication operators offer regular television programming with dvr services as part of their server based vod offerings  consumers would have an alternate means of watching time shifted shows besides physical dvrs 
in such an event  competitors would be able to deploy competing dvr services without the expense of deploying dvr hardware in consumer homes 
such an event would impair our ability to compete in a cost effective manner with these television providers as well as attract and retain customers  in which case  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we are currently only able to offer a high definition dvr that has access to digital cable signals 
only the cable industry in the united states is currently required to provide access to digital high definition television signals through cablecard technology 
without separate agreements with satellite operators  such as our agreement with directv  or other telecommunication providers  such as verizon or at t  who offer television service that would give us access to digital and high definition television  our ability to attract their subscribers to the tivo service is limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

table of contents consumers may not be willing to pay for our products and services 
many of our customers already pay monthly fees for cable or satellite television 
we must convince these consumers to pay an additional subscription fee to receive the tivo service 
consumers may perceive the tivo service and related dvr as too expensive 
in order to continue to grow our subscription base  we may need to reduce our costs and lower the price of our dvr or service fees 
the availability of competing services that do not require subscription fees or that are enabled by low or no cost dvrs will harm our ability to effectively attract and retain subscriptions 
growth in our tivo owned subscriptions and related revenues could be harmed by competitive offerings by comcast and cox who also would be able to offer the tivo service in the future 
our ability to grow our tivo owned subscriptions and related revenues could be harmed by competition from our licensing partners  such as comcast and cox  who may be able to offer tivo branded dvr solutions to their customers at more attractive pricing than we may be able to offer the tivo service to our tivo owned customers 
furthermore  if we are unable to differentiate the tivo service from the tivo branded dvr solutions offered by our licensing partners  customers who would have otherwise chosen the tivo service may instead choose to purchase the tivo branded dvr solution from our licensing partners 
additionally  to the extent that potential customers defer subscribing to the tivo service in order to wait for announced  but not yet deployed in their geographic area  tivo branded dvr solutions from our licensing partners  such as comcast and cox  the growth of our tivo owned subscriptions could be reduced 
if the growth in our tivo owned subscriptions is reduced  our business could be harmed 
it is expensive to establish a strong brand 
we believe that establishing and strengthening the tivo brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and to establishing key strategic relationships 
the importance of brand recognition will increase as current and potential competitors enter the digital video recorder market with competing products and services 
our ability to promote and position our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services and customer support 
these activities are expensive and we may not generate a corresponding increase in subscriptions or revenues to justify these costs 
if we fail to establish and maintain our brand  or if our brand value is damaged or diluted  we may be unable to attract subscriptions and effectively compete in the digital video recorder market 
we rely on our retail customers and service providers to market and distribute our products and services 
in addition to our own efforts  our retail customers distribute dvrs that enable the tivo service 
we rely on their sales forces  marketing budgets and brand images to promote and support dvrs and the tivo service 
additionally  we now depend on service providers  such as comcast to market and promote the tivo service 
we expect to continue to rely on our relationships with these companies to promote and support dvrs and other devices that enable the tivo service 
the loss of one or more of these companies could require us to undertake more of these activities on our own 
as a result  we would spend significant resources to support the tivo service and dvrs and other devices that enable the tivo service 
the failure of one or more of these companies to provide anticipated marketing support will require us to divert more of our limited resources to marketing the tivo service 
if we are unable to provide adequate marketing support for dvrs and the tivo service  our ability to attract subscriptions to the tivo service will be limited 
many consumers are not aware of the benefits of our products 
dvr products and services represent a relatively new consumer electronics category 
retailers  consumers  and potential partners may perceive little or no benefit from digital video recorder products and services 
we have only been providing the tivo service since many consumers are not aware of its benefits  and therefore may not value the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
we will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time and resources to educate consumers and promote our products in order to increase our subscriptions 
we cannot be sure that a broad base of consumers will ultimately subscribe to the tivo service or purchase the products that enable the tivo service 
we face risks  such as increased churn of our subscription base and decrease in future new subscriptions  in connection with the transition from analog to digital broadcast transmission in june on june   the nation s full power television stations will begin transmitting in all digital broadcast signals and no longer use the traditional analog method of broadcasting over the air television 
only those consumers who currently receive analog television over the air or via an antenna will be impacted by this transition 
consumers accessing pay television service such as cable or satellite are not likely to be immediately affected by the switch 
however  consumer confusion around the transition to digital broadcast signals poses risks to our business from consumers mistakenly believing their tivo dvr is not compatible with the digital transition in 
table of contents we face risks associated with various cable operators making their own transition to digital transmission of cable signals 
we face increased risks in addition to the digital transition as cable operators are currently only required to carry analog signals for customers through february where cable operators transmit in both analog and digital formats 
cable operators who transmit entirely in digital format to their customers and make set top boxes available to such customers are exempted from the dual carriage mandate 
our business faces increased risks as cable operators convert their systems to transmit in all digital format because our dual tuner standard definition series dvr is reduced to a single tuner experience when used exclusively with a cable set top box and no analog cable transmission is available 
the lack of an analog signal being transmitted by the cable operator means that the dvr would only be able to use one tuner to record television although we do currently offer to our customers a high definition digital video recorder  the tivo hd dvr  which is cablecard capable and not subject to this risk 
in the event that the features and functionality of our series dvrs currently deployed with customers or which are otherwise for sale to customers are impacted  such an impact may cause such customers to cancel their subscriptions or not purchase a standard definition series dvr 
the migration of cable systems to all digital transmissions could result in increased customer churn or deter new customers from subscribing to the tivo service  and in such an event our business would be harmed 
if we are unable to create or maintain multiple revenue streams  we may not be able to cover our expenses and this could cause our revenues to suffer 
our long term success depends on our ability to generate revenues from multiple revenue streams 
our long term success will depend on securing additional revenue streams such as licensing  advertising  audience research measurement  revenues from programmers  and electronic commerce 
in order to derive substantial revenues from these activities  we will need to attract and retain a large and growing base of subscriptions to the tivo service 
we also will need to work closely with television advertisers  cable  satellite  and telecommunications network operators  electronic commerce companies  and consumer electronics manufacturers to develop products and services in these areas 
we may not be able to work effectively with these parties to develop products that generate revenues that are sufficient to justify their costs 
we also may be unable to work with  or to continue working with  these parties to distribute video and collect and distribute data or other information to provide these product or services 
in addition  we are currently obligated to share a portion of these revenues with several of our strategic partners 
any inability to attract and retain a large and growing group of subscriptions or inability to attract new strategic partners or maintain and extend our relationships with our current strategic partners could seriously harm our ability to support new services and develop new revenue streams 
we face risks in connection with our licensing and marketing agreements with comcast and cox for the development and deployment of a tivo branded dvr software solution and advertising management system to comcast and cox customers 
we may not be successful in our agreements with comcast and cox 
we face significant technological challenges in our development of the tivo service software solution and the tivo advertising management system for comcast and cox 
if we are unable to successfully develop these products in a timely and efficient manner and enable mass deployment of them by comcast and cox  we may not be successful in our relationships with them and our business could be harmed 
our ability to benefit from our agreements with comcast and cox are dependent upon the mass deployment and adoption of the tivo service software solution by comcast and cox customers 
additionally  our ability to benefit from our agreements with comcast and cox are dependent upon our ability to successfully sell advertising to third parties 
furthermore  comcast and cox each have the right to receive certain most favored terms from us such that if we were to license similar products and services to other parties at more attractive terms than what comcast or cox receive under their respective agreements with us  they may be entitled to receive the new more favorable terms 
additionally  comcast and cox each have the right to terminate its agreement with us in the event we are subject to certain specified change of control transactions involving companies specified in their respective agreements 
in the event any of these events occurred  we would have difficulty generating revenues under these agreements and our business could be harmed 

table of contents if we are unable to introduce new products or services  or if our new products and services are unsuccessful  the growth in our subscription base and revenues may suffer 
to attract and retain subscriptions and generate revenues  we must continue to maintain and add to our functionality and content and introduce products and services which embody new technologies and  in some instances  new industry standards 
this challenge will require hardware and software improvements  as well as maintaining and adding new collaborations with programmers  advertisers  network operators  hardware manufacturers  and other strategic partners 
these activities require significant time and resources and may require us to develop and promote new ways of generating revenue with established companies in the television industry 
these companies include television advertisers  cable and satellite network operators  electronic commerce companies  and consumer electronics manufacturers 
in each of these examples  a small number of large companies dominate a major portion of the market and may be reluctant to work with us to develop new products and services for digital video recorders as well as maintain our current functionality 
if we are unable to maintain and further develop and improve the tivo service or maintain and expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner  our ability to attract and retain customers and generate revenue will suffer 
we face competitive risks in the provision of an entertainment offering involving the distribution of digital content through broadband  including from broadband devices connected directly to the tv or through a pc connected to the tv 
over the past two years we launched joint entertainment offerings with the amazon video on demand formerly unbox service  netflix  cinemanow  and jaman for the distribution of digital content directly to broadband connected tivo dvrs 
our offerings with amazon video on demand  netflix  cinemanow  and jaman involve no significant long term commitments 
we face competitive  technological  and business risks in our on going provision of an entertainment offering involving the distribution of digital content through broadband to consumer televisions with amazon  netflix  and others  including availability of premium content and speed and quality of the delivery  including the availability of high definition content in the future  of such content to tivo dvrs 
for instance  we face increased competition from a growing number of broadband enabled devices from providers such as roku and vudu which provide broadband delivered digital content directly to a consumer s television connected to such a device 
additionally  we face competition from online content providers and other pc software providers who deliver digital content directly to a consumer s personal computer  which in some cases may then be viewed on a consumer s television 
if we are unable to provide a competitive entertainment offering with amazon video on demand  netflix  blockbuster  and our other partners  on our own  or an equivalent offering with another third party  the attractiveness of the tivo service to new subscribers could be harmed as consumers increasingly look for new ways to receive and view digital content and our ability to retain and attract subscribers could be harmed 
our ability to retain our current customers may continue to decrease in the future which could increase our tivo owned subscription monthly churn rate and could cause our revenues to suffer 
we believe factors such as increased competition in the dvr marketplace  changing television technologies such as the increasing penetration of high definition  the use of switched digital technology to deliver encrypted digital television signals  and the failure of cable operators in the future to transmit both an analog and digital transmission thus impacting our series dvrs  increased price sensitivity in the consumer base  any deterioration in the quality of our service  and product lifetime subscriptions no longer using our service may cause our tivo owned subscription monthly churn rate to increase 
if we are unable to retain our subscriptions by limiting the factors that we believe increase subscription churn  our ability to grow our subscription base could suffer and our revenues could be harmed 
if we fail to manage the growth and complexity of our activities  it could disrupt our business and impair our ability to generate revenues 
the growth in our subscription base and increasing complexity of our sources of other revenue have placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources and systems 
specific risks we face as our business expands include any inability of our systems to accommodate our expected subscription growth  or any inability of our tivo 
com website to handle expected customer traffic  may cause service interruptions or delay our introduction of new services and limit our ability to sell the tivo service and tivo enabled dvrs 
we internally developed many of the systems we use to provide the tivo service and perform other processing functions 
the ability of these systems to scale as we add new subscriptions is unproven 
we must continually improve these systems to accommodate subscription growth and to add features and functionality to the tivo service 
our inability to add software and hardware or to upgrade our technology  systems or network infrastructure could adversely affect our business  cause service interruptions or delay the introduction of new services 
our inability to manage customer traffic and sales volume through our tivo 
com website could limit our ability to sell the tivo service and tivo enabled dvrs in the future 
if our website were to become unavailable for a significant amount of time  our ability to provide certain features of the tivo service and our ability to service customers and sell the tivo service and tivo enabled dvrs would be harmed 

table of contents we will need to provide acceptable customer support  particularly with respect to installation of dvrs and cablecards  and any inability to do so would harm our brand and ability to retain current subscriptions and generate new subscriptions 
our ability to increase sales  retain current and future subscriptions and strengthen our brand will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations  including our ability to assist customers with installation and cablecard related issues 
some customers require significant support when installing the dvr and required cablecards for our hd dvrs and becoming acquainted with the features and functionality of the tivo service 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products  services  and cablecard installation requirements to a diverse customer base  and we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers require 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with third parties to provide this support and will rely on them for a substantial portion of our customer support functions 
furthermore  the installation of cablecards for tivo customers is performed by third party cable operators and tivo is dependent on such parties to timely service new subscribers to enable their receipt of digital and premium cable content 
our failure to provide adequate customer support for the tivo service  dvrs  and cablecards will damage our reputation in the digital video recorder and consumer electronics marketplace and strain our relationships with customers and consumer electronics manufacturers 
this could prevent us from gaining new or retaining existing subscriptions and could cause harm to our reputation and brand 
we will need to improve our operational and financial systems to support our expected growth  increasingly complex business arrangements  and rules governing revenue and expense recognition and any inability to do so will adversely affect our billing and reporting 
we have increasingly complex business arrangements  and the rules which govern revenue and expense recognition in our business are increasingly complex as well 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity  we will need to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on manual operations 
any inability to do so will affect our billing and reporting 
our current and planned systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our complex arrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth 
delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely affect our relationships with our customers  cause harm to our reputation and brand  and could also result in errors in our financial and other reporting 
if we fail to adequately manage our increasingly complex licensing  development  and engineering services agreements  we could be subjected to unexpected costs and incur losses which could adversely affect our business 
we engage in licensing  development  and engineering services agreements with our customers  such as comcast  cox  and directv 
these types of contracts are typically long term and complex 
the engineering services we agree to provide may be essential to the functionality of the licensed software or such software may involve significant customization and modification 
we believe we are able to make reasonably dependable cost estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions 
these estimates are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
using different cost estimates related to engineering services may produce materially different results for related expenses and revenues 
a favorable change in estimates in a period could result in additional revenue and profit  and an unfavorable change in estimates could result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that would be borne solely by us 
any inability to properly manage  estimate  and perform these development and engineering services for our customers could cause us to incur unexpected losses and reduce or even eliminate any profit from these arrangements  and in such a case our business would be harmed 
we must manage product transitions successfully in order to remain competitive 
the introduction of a new product or product line is a complex task  involving significant expenditures in research and development  training  promotion and sales channel development  and management of existing product inventories to reduce the cost associated with returns and slow moving inventory 
as new products are introduced  we intend to monitor closely the inventory of products to be replaced  and to phase out their manufacture in a controlled manner 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to execute product transitions in this manner or that product transitions will be executed without harming our operating results 
failure to develop products with required features and performance levels or any delay in bringing a new product to market could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our competitive position 

table of contents the product lifetime subscriptions to the tivo service that we currently are obligated to service commit us to providing services for an indefinite period 
the revenue we generate from these subscriptions may be insufficient to cover future costs and will negatively impact our tivo owned average revenue per subscription 
we offer a product lifetime subscription option to the tivo service that commits us to provide the tivo service for as long as the dvr is in service 
we received the product lifetime subscription fee for the tivo service in advance and amortize it as subscription revenue over months for product lifetime subscriptions which is our current estimate of the service life of the dvr 
if these product lifetime subscriptions use the dvr for longer than anticipated  we will incur costs such as telecommunications and customer support costs without a corresponding subscription revenue stream and therefore will be required to fund ongoing costs of service from other sources 
additionally  if these product lifetime subscriptions use the dvr for longer than the period in which we recognize revenue  our average revenues per subscription arpu for our tivo owned subscriptions will be negatively impacted as we continue to count these customers as subscriptions without corresponding subscription revenue thus lowering our average revenues across our tivo owned subscription base 
as of january   we had approximately  product lifetime subscriptions that had exceeded the month period we use to recognize product lifetime subscription revenues and had made contact with the tivo service within the prior six month period 
this represents approximately of our cumulative lifetime subscriptions as compared to in fiscal year ended january  we will continue to monitor the useful life of a tivo enabled dvr and the impact of higher churn  increased competition  and compatibility of our existing tivo units with high definition programming 
future results will allow us to determine if our useful life is shorter or longer than currently estimated  in which case we may revise the estimated life and we would recognize revenues from this source over a shorter or longer period 
we share a substantial portion of the revenue we generate from subscription fees with some of our retail customers and consumer electronics companies 
we may be unable to generate enough revenue to cover these obligations 
in some of our agreements  we have agreed to share a substantial portion of our subscription and other fees with some of our retail customers and consumer electronics manufacturing companies in exchange for manufacturing  distribution and marketing support  and discounts on key components for dvrs 
these agreements require us to share substantial portions of the subscription and other fees attributable to the same subscription with multiple companies 
these agreements also require us to share a portion of our subscription fees whether or not we increase or decrease the price of the tivo service 
if we change our subscription fees in response to competitive or other market factors  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our decision to share subscription revenues is based on our expectation that these relationships will help us obtain subscriptions  broaden market acceptance of digital video recorders  and increase our future revenues 
if these expectations are not met  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 
we advertise  market  and sell our services directly to consumers  many of these activities are highly regulated by constantly evolving state and federal laws and regulations and violations of these laws and regulations could harm our business 
we engage in various advertising  marketing  and other promotional activities  such as offering gift subscriptions to consumers  which are subject to state and federal laws and regulations 
a constantly evolving network of state and federal laws is increasingly regulating these promotional activities 
additionally  we enter into subscription service contracts directly with consumers which govern both our provision of and the consumers payment for the tivo service 
for example  consumers who activate new monthly subscriptions to the tivo service are required to commit to pay for the tivo service for a minimum of one year or be subject to an early termination fee equal to the number of months left unpaid on their commitment if they terminate prior to the expiration of their commitment period 
if the terms of our subscription service contracts with consumers  such as our imposition of an early termination fee  or our previously offered rebate or gift subscription programs were to violate state or federal laws or regulations  we could be subject to suit  penalties  and or negative publicity in which case our business could be harmed 
the nature of some of our business relationships may restrict our ability to operate freely in the future 
from time to time  we have engaged and may engage in the future in discussions with other parties concerning business relationships  which have and may include equity investments by such parties in our company 
while we believe that such business relationships have historically enhanced our ability to finance and develop our business model  the terms and conditions of such business relationships may place some restrictions on the operation of our business in the future 

table of contents entertainment companies and other content owners may claim that some of the features of our dvrs violate copyright or trademark laws  which could force us to incur significant costs in defending such actions and affect our ability to market the tivo service and the products that enable the tivo service 
although we have not been the subject of such actions to date  a past competitor s digital video recorders were the subject of several copyright infringement lawsuits by a number of major entertainment companies  including the major television networks 
these lawsuits alleged that the competitor s digital video recorders violate copyright laws by allowing users to skip commercials  delete recordings only when instructed and use the internet to send recorded materials to other users 
tivo enabled dvrs have some similar features  including the ability to fast forward through commercials  the ability to delete recordings only when instructed and the ability to transfer recordings from a tivo enabled dvr to a pc and or portable media devices via tivotogo transfers 
based on market or consumer pressures  we may decide in the future to add additional features that may be objectionable to entertainment companies 
if similar actions are filed against us based on current or future features of our dvrs  entertainment companies may seek injunctions to prevent us from including these features and or damages 
such litigation can be costly and may divert the efforts of our management 
furthermore  if we were ordered to remove features from our dvrs  we may experience increased difficulty in marketing the tivo service and related tivo enabled dvrs and may suffer reduced revenues as a result 
entertainment companies  networks  or video distributors may claim that our advertising products or features may unintentionally violate copyright or trademark laws or otherwise unfairly compete with them  which could result in the blocking  stripping or failure to carry out our advertising products or features or force us to incur significant costs in defending such actions and affect our ability to generate advertising revenues 
entertainment companies  networks  or video distributors may claim that our advertising products or features may unintentionally violate copyright or trademark laws  or otherwise unfairly compete with them  by being placed within  adjacent to  or on top of  existing video programming or advertising 
entertainment companies or video distributors may seek injunctions to prevent us from offering these products or features  seek damages and or take other measures  such as blocking  stripping or refusing carriage to prevent us from selling or distributing our advertising products 
if we were unable to sell or distribute our advertising products or features on our dvrs  we may suffer reduced revenues as a result 
our success depends on our ability to secure and protect our patents  trademarks  and other proprietary rights 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology 
we rely on patent  trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  customers  partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
we have filed patent applications and provisional patent applications covering substantially all of the technology used to deliver the tivo service and its features and functionality 
to date  several of these patents have been granted  but we cannot assure you that any additional patents will ever be granted  that any issued patents will protect our intellectual property or that third parties will not challenge any issued patents 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents that may be issued to us 
our failure to secure and protect our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we could be prevented from selling or developing our tivo software if the gnu linux operating system is held to infringe third party intellectual property rights or if the gnu general public license governing the gnu linux operating system and linux kernel and similar licenses under which our product is developed and licensed are not enforceable or are interpreted broadly 
our tivo software includes parts of the linux kernel and the gnu linux operating system 
the linux kernel and the gnu linux operating system have been developed and licensed under the gnu general public license  version and similar open source licenses 
the software we have licensed under these open source licenses is provided without warranties or indemnities from the licensor 
uncertainty concerning potential allegations by third parties that their intellectual property rights are violated by tivo s use of such open source software  regardless of their merit  could adversely affect our manufacturing relationships and other customer and supplier relationships 
if any claims of intellectual property infringement are brought against tivo based on our use of open source software  we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our solutions  to re engineer our solutions  or to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event re engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis  any of which would adversely affect our business 
the gnu general public license and certain other open source licenses require that licensees  including tivo  make the source code of any derivative works of the software licensed under the open source license available in source code form 
given the ambiguous drafting in many of these open source licenses regarding the definition of derivative work  it is possible that third parties may claim that our proprietary tivo software  or a portion 
table of contents thereof  that runs on a gnu linux based operating system is a derivative work of the open source software and should be made available in source code form to all of our customers 
this would reduce the value of our proprietary software and would negatively affect our business 
finally  there is very little case law interpreting open source licenses 
any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable  or that gnu linux based operating systems  or significant portions of them  may not be liberally copied  modified or distributed  would have the effect of preventing us from selling or developing our tivo software and would adversely affect our business 
in addition  a version of the gnu general public license gpl v was recently released that contains terms that restrict the manner in which hardware manufacturers may use software licensed under the gpl v if such terms are broadly interpreted and the gpl v is widely adopted among the linux developer community  we may be unable to incorporate future enhancements to the gnu linux operating system into our software  which could adversely affect our business 
if there is an adverse outcome in the class action litigation that has been filed against us  our business may be harmed 
we are named as defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
this class action was brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of the company s common stock from october   the time of its initial public offering  through december  the central allegation in this action is that the underwriters in the initial public offering solicited and received undisclosed commissions from  and entered into undisclosed arrangements with certain investors who purchased tivo common stock in the initial public offering and the after market 
the complaint also alleges that the tivo defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose in the initial public offering prospectus that the underwriters had engaged in these alleged undisclosed arrangements 
more than issuers have been named in similar lawsuits 
the company intends to defend this action vigorously  however  we could be forced to incur material expenses in the litigation  and in the event there is an adverse outcome  our business could be harmed 
for more information on this litigation please see our discussion under item legal proceedings 
legislation  laws or regulations that govern the consumer electronics and television industry  the delivery of programming  access to television signals  and the collection of viewing information from subscriptions could expose us to legal action if we fail to comply and could adversely impact and or could require us to change our business 
the delivery of television programming  access to television signals by consumer electronics devices  and the collection of viewing information from subscriptions via the tivo service and a dvr represent a relatively new category in the television and home entertainment industries 
as such  it is difficult to predict what laws or regulations will govern our business 
changes in the regulatory climate  the enactment of new legislation  or the expansion  contraction  enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations could expose us to additional costs and expenses and could adversely impact or require changes to our business 
for example  legislation regarding customer privacy or copyright could be enacted or expanded to apply to the tivo service  which could adversely affect our business 
laws or regulations could be interpreted to prevent or limit access to some or all television signals by certain consumer electronics devices  or impose limits on the number of copies  the ability to transfer or move copies  or the length of time a consumer may retain copies of some or all types of television programming 
new or existing copyright laws could be applied to restrict the capture of television programming  which would adversely affect our business 
it is unknown whether existing laws and regulations will apply to the digital video recorder market 
therefore  it is difficult to anticipate the impact of current or future laws and regulations on our business 
we may have significant expenses associated with staying appraised of local  state  federal  and international legislation and regulation of our business and in presenting tivo s positions on proposed laws and regulations 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has broad jurisdiction over the telecommunications and cable industries 
the fcc could promulgate new regulations  or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would cause us to incur significant compliance costs or force us to alter or eliminate certain features or functionality of the tivo products or services which may adversely affect our business 
for example  the fcc could determine that certain of our products fail to comply with regulations concerning matters such as electrical interference  copy protection  digital tuners  or display of television programming based on rating systems 
the fcc could also impose limits on the number of copies  the ability to transfer or move copies  the length of time a consumer may retain copies  or the ability to access some or all types of television programming 

table of contents if there is increased use of switched digital video technologies to transmit television programs by cable operators also known as switched digital in the future  the desirability and competitiveness of our current products could be reduced in which case our business would be harmed 
we rely on conditional access security cards supplied by cable operators called cablecards for certain types of our dvrs to receive encrypted digital television signals without a cable operator supplied set top box 
these dvrs presently are limited to using cablecards to access digital cable  high definition  and premium cable channels like hbo that are delivered in a linear fashion where all programs are broadcast to all subscribers all the time 
certain cable operators are beginning to test and deploy switched digital video technologies to transmit television programs in a non linear fashion switched digital only to subscribers who request to watch a particular program 
although cable operators have started to deploy a solution to enable our customers to receive channels delivered with switched technologies known as the tuning adapter  if this technology is not successful or in not adopted by our customers due to cost  complexity  or functionality  then the increased use of switched technologies and the continued inability of our products to receive switched cable programming without a tuning adapter may reduce the desirability and competitiveness of our products and services and adversely affect sales of our tivo owned subscriptions in which case our business would be harmed 
uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
uncertainty or adverse changes in the economy could lead to a significant decline in discretionary consumer spending  which  in turn  could result in a decline in the demand for the tivo service and tivo enabled dvrs 
as a result of the recent national and global economic downturn  overall consumer spending has declined 
retailers in north america appear to be taking a more conservative stance in ordering electronics inventory and consumers as well appear to be taking a more conservative stance in discretionary purchases  including tivo dvrs and service subscriptions 
any decrease in demand for our products  particularly during the critical holiday selling season  could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of losses on our investments  increase costs associated with developing and producing our products  increase our churn rate per month  increase the cost and decrease the availability of potential sources of financing  and increase our exposure to losses from bad debts  any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
our business could be adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster 
our corporate headquarters is located in alviso  california which is where the overwhelming majority of our employees work 
our primary servers are located nearby in san jose  california 
alviso and san jose lay near the san andreas fault  among other known and unknown faults  a major source of earthquake activity in california 
in the event of an earthquake or similar natural disaster  our ability to continue operations could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 
legislation  laws or regulations relating to environmental issues  employment matters  and unclaimed property may adversely impact our business in the future 
it is possible that future proposed environmental regulations on consumer electronic devices  such as dvrs and set top boxes  may regulate and increase the production  manufacture  use  and disposal costs incurred by us and our customers 
for example  the energy independence and security act of directs the department of energy to prescribe labeling or other disclosure requirements for the energy use of stand alone digital video recorder boxes 
this and future energy regulations could potentially make it more costly for us to design  manufacture  and sell our dvrs to our customers thus harming the growth of our business 
additionally  as our business grows and we expand our employed and contracted work force  employment laws and regulations will have an increasing impact on our ability to manage and grow our work force 
regulations and laws relating to the status of contractors  classification and related benefits for exempt and non exempt employees all may adversely impact our business if we are unable to properly manage and comply with federal  state  and local laws 
furthermore  as part of our regular business activities now  and in the past  we engage in the issuance of gift subscriptions and the marketing of rebate offers related to the sale of our products and services 
it is possible that money received by us for the sale of gift subscriptions or related to our past rebate offers could be subject to state and federal escheat  or unclaimed property  laws in the future 
if this were the case  our business could be adversely impacted 
if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the collection of sales tax and payment of income taxes in the various states in which we do business  we could be exposed to unexpected costs  expenses  penalties  and fees as a result of our noncompliance in which case our business could be harmed 
as our business grows and expands  we have started to do business in an increasing number of states nationally 
by engaging in business activities in these states  we become subject to their various laws and regulations  including requirements to collect sales tax from our sales within those states and the payment of income taxes on revenue 
table of contents generated from activities in those states 
the laws and regulations governing the collection of sales tax and payment of income taxes are numerous  complex  and vary between states 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations requiring the collection of sales tax and payment of income taxes in one or more states where we do business  we could be subject to significant costs  expenses  penalties  and fees in which case our business could be harmed 
compliance with federal securities laws and regulations is costly 
the federal securities laws and regulations  including the corporate governance and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting 
these requirements impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members  and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers  chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
these requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal compliance costs  increase the difficulty and expense in obtaining director and officer liability insurance  and make it harder for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and or qualified executive officers 
such developments could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 
the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors  misstatements or misrepresentations 
while management continues to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  we can not assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time 
deficiencies  particularly a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting  which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations  restatements of our financial statements  a decline in our stock price  the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global market  or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  reputation  results of operation  financial condition or liquidity 
the nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the current legislative and regulatory environment affecting us generally accepted accounting principles gaap is uncertain and volatile  and significant changes in current principles could affect our financial statements going forward 
the accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and continually changing 
recent actions and public comments from the securities exchange commission have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally 
in addition  many companies accounting policies are being subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public 
while we believe that our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we cannot predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies on our financial statements going forward 
in addition  were we to change our critical accounting estimates  including the timing of recognition of revenue from our product lifetime subscriptions  our results of operations could be significantly impacted 
negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a portion of our investment portfolio 
our long term investment securities represent approximately of our total cash  cash equivalent  short term and long term investments 
these investment securities consist of investment grade auction rate securities 
as of march   our long term investments included approximately million of investment grade auction rate securities issued by education finance companies  on which we have recorded unrealized losses of approximately million as of january  our auction rate securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
the recent conditions in the global credit markets have prevented us from liquidating our holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities 
if there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of an auction  the auction may not be completed and the interest rates may be reset to predetermined higher rates 
although to date  we have not recorded any realized gains or losses on our investment portfolio  when auctions for these securities fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful or they are redeemed or mature 
if the financial health of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 

table of contents we and the third party vendors we work with will need to remain compliant with the payment card industry requirements for security and protection of customer credit card information and an inability to do so by us or our third party vendors will adversely affect our business 
as a merchant who processes credit card payments from its customers  we are required to comply with the payment card industry requirements imposed on us for the protection and security of our customers credit card information 
if we are unable to successfully remain compliant with the payment card industry requirements imposed on us as a credit card merchant  our business could be harmed because we could be prevented in the future from transacting customer subscription payments by means of a credit card 
we need to safeguard the security and privacy of our subscribers confidential data  and any inability to do so may harm our reputation and brand and expose us to legal action 
the dvr collects and stores viewer preferences and other data that many of our customers consider confidential 
any compromise or breach of the encryption and other security measures that we use to protect this data could harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments could compromise or breach the systems we use to protect our subscribers confidential information 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to remedy problems caused by any breaches 
uncertainty in the marketplace regarding the use of data from subscriptions could reduce demand for the tivo service and result in increased expenses 
consumers may be concerned about the use of viewing information gathered by the tivo service and the dvr 
currently  we gather anonymous information about our customers viewing choices while using the tivo service  unless a customer affirmatively consents to the collection of personally identifiable viewing information 
this anonymous viewing information does not identify the individual customer 
privacy concerns  however  could create uncertainty in the marketplace for digital video recording and for our products and services 
changes in our privacy policy could reduce demand for the tivo service  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs  or otherwise harm our reputation and business 
we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  and our failure to comply with the laws and regulations there under could result in penalties which could harm our reputation  business  and financial condition 
we are subject to the fcpa  which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business 
the fcpa also requires companies to maintain adequate record keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company 
under the fcpa  us companies may be held liable for actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives 
the fcpa and similar laws in other countries can impose civil and criminal penalties for violations 
if we do not properly implement practices and controls with respect to compliance with the fcpa and similar laws  or if we fail to enforce those practices and controls properly  we may be subject to regulatory sanctions  including administrative costs related to governmental and internal investigations  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and restrictions on our business activities  all of which could harm our reputation  business and financial condition 
we face significant risks in overseeing our outsourcing of manufacturing processes as well as in the management of our inventory  and failure to properly oversee our manufacturing processes or to effectively manage our inventory levels may result in product recalls or supply imbalances that could harm our business 
we have contracted for the manufacture of certain tivo enabled dvrs with a contract manufacturer 
we sell these units to retailers and distributors  as well as through our own online sales channels 
product manufacturing is outside our core business and we face significant risks if our contract manufacturer does not perform as expected 
if we fail to effectively oversee the manufacturing process  including the work performed by our contract manufacturer  we could suffer from product recalls  poorly performing product  and higher than anticipated warranty costs 
in connection with our manufacturing operations  we maintain a finished goods inventory of the dvr units we produce throughout the year 
due to the seasonality in our business and our long lead time product development and manufacturing cycles  we need to make forecasts of demand and commit significant resources towards manufacturing of our dvr units well in advance of our peak selling periods 
as such  we are subject to significant risks in managing the inventory needs of our business during the year  including estimates of the appropriate mix of demand across our older and newer dvr models 
for example  due to lower than expected sales of standard definition dvrs and the resulting changes in our sales forecast  in the fiscal year ended january  we recorded an inventory related charge of million for excess raw materials  finished goods inventory  and non cancelable purchase commitments 
subsequently  the actual sales of our standard definition dvrs exceeded our expectations and we utilized approximately million of 
table of contents previously impaired inventory during the fiscal year ended january  if we were to over estimate demand for our dvrs  we may end up with inventories that exceed currently forecasted demand which would require us to record additional write downs 
should actual market conditions differ from the company s estimates  the company s future results of operations could be materially affected 
in the future  we may be required to record additional write downs of finished products and materials on hand and or additional charges for excess purchase commitments as a result of future changes in our sales forecasts 
we have limited experience and face significant competition in providing service and operations internationally that are subject to different competitors  laws  regulations  and requirements than those in the united states and our inability to compete or comply with such laws  regulations  and requirements could harm our reputation  brand  and have a negative impact on revenues 
we have provided and expect to continue to provide the tivo service in jurisdictions outside of the united states  including the united kingdom  mexico  canada  australia and in the future new zealand 
we have limited experience in international operations 
we face significant competition and technological challenges in competing with other consumer electronics manufacturers in these jurisdictions and in complying with international laws and technological standards such the various digital over the air standards like dvb t 
if we are unable to properly manage our international operations or comply with international laws  regulations  and requirements  we could suffer damage to our reputation  brand  and revenues and as a result our business could be harmed 
we have and expect to continue to partner with local broadcasters  cable television operators  and satellite providers to provide the tivo service internationally 
transactions with international partners may never materialize or may not result in significant revenue for us and may result in significant costs 
we face significant risks to our business when we engage in the outsourcing of engineering work which  if not properly managed  could result in the loss of valuable intellectual property which could harm our business 
we have from time to time outsourced engineering work related to the design  development  and manufacturing of our products 
we have and expect to in the future work with companies located in jurisdictions outside of the united states  including  but not limited to  china  india  ukraine  and mexico 
we have limited experience in the outsourcing of engineering  manufacturing and other work to third parties located internationally that operate under different laws and regulations than those in the united states 
if we are unable to properly manage and oversee the outsourcing of this engineering  manufacturing and other work related to our products  we could suffer the loss of valuable intellectual property  including patents  trademarks  trade secrets  and copyrights and as a result our business could be harmed 
product defects  system failures  or interruptions to the tivo service may have a negative impact on our revenues  damage our reputation and decrease our ability to attract new customers 
our ability to provide uninterrupted service and high quality customer support depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
our computer hardware and other operating systems for the tivo service are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures and similar events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
these types of interruptions in the tivo service may reduce our revenues and profits 
we currently house the server hardware that delivers the tivo service at only one location and continue to explore the benefits of establishing a backup facility 
our business also will be harmed if consumers believe our service is unreliable 
in addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff  service outages will create a flood of customer questions and complaints that must be responded to by our customer support personnel 
any frequent or persistent system failures could irreparably damage our reputation and brand and possibly trigger requests for refunds on subscription fees and hardware purchases and possible consumer litigation 
we have detected in the past and may continue to detect errors and product defects in the future 
these problems can affect system uptime and result in significant warranty and repair problems  which could cause customer service and customer relations problems 
correcting errors in our software or fixing defects in our products requires significant time and resources  which could delay product releases and affect market acceptance of the tivo service 
any delivery by us of products or upgrades with undetected material product defects or software errors could harm our credibility and market acceptance of the dvrs and the tivo service 
in addition  defective products could cause a risk of injury that may subject us to litigation or cause us to have to undertake a product recall 
for example  we previously became aware of occasions where a part came loose from the remote control device that comes with the dvrs that enable the tivo service  including occurrences where a young child gagged on or ingested a part of the remote control device 
while we are unaware of any injuries resulting from the use of our products  we may be subject to products liability litigation in the future 
additionally  if we are required to repair or replace any of our products  we could incur significant costs  which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we lose senior management or other key engineering personnel or are unable to replace or recruit key management and engineering personnel  we may not be able to successfully operate our business 
our future performance and growth will be substantially dependent on the continued services of our senior management and other key engineering personnel as well our ability to replace departed personnel and ability to recruit key management and engineering personnel in the future 
the loss of any members of our senior management team or other key engineering personnel and our inability to hire additional senior management or other key engineering personnel could harm our business and results of operations 
competition to recruit and retain key management  engineering and other personnel in silicon valley is highly competitive 
in addition  we do not have key man insurance policies for any of our key personnel which may adversely affect our ability to replace members of senior management 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  rights agreement and delaware law could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of our common stock 
in the future  we could become the subject of an unsolicited attempted takeover of our company 
although an unsolicited takeover could be in the best interests of our stockholders  certain provisions of delaware law  our organizational documents and our rights agreement could be impediments to such a takeover 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing 
in addition  special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of the total number of authorized directors  the chairman of the board  our chief executive officer or the holders of or more of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provide that directors may be removed only for cause by a vote of a majority of the stockholders and that vacancies on the board of directors created either by resignation  death  disqualification  removal or by an increase in the size of the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors in office  although less than a quorum 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors and specifies that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
on january   our board of directors adopted a rights agreement 
our rights agreement was last amended on april  each share of our common stock has attached to it a right to purchase one one hundredth of a share of our series b junior participating preferred stock at a price of per one one hundredth of a preferred share 
subject to limited exceptions  the rights will become exercisable following the tenth day after a person or group announces the acquisition of or more of our common stock  and thereby becomes an acquiring person  or announces commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer  the consummation of which would result in the ownership by the person or group of or more of our common stock 
in the event that a person becomes an acquiring person or if we are the surviving corporation in a merger with an acquiring person and the shares of our common stock were not changed or exchanged  the rights will thereafter become exercisable for a number of shares of our common stock equal to two times the then current purchase price of the right 
on april   we amended the rights plan s definition of acquiring person to remove the limited carve out for america online  inc and its affiliates and associates to acquire up to of our common stock 
the rights are not exercisable as of the date of this filing 
we will be entitled to redeem the rights at per right at any time prior to the time that a person or group becomes an acquiring person 
these provisions of delaware law  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and our rights agreement could make it more difficult for us to be acquired by another company  even if our acquisition is in the best interests of our stockholders 
any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the future  our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
therefore  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some periods our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
factors that may affect our annual operating results include demand for tivo enabled dvrs and the tivo service  
table of contents the timing and introduction of new services and features on the tivo service  seasonality and other consumer and advertising trends  changes in revenue sharing arrangements with our strategic relationships  entering into new or terminating existing strategic partnerships  changes in our pricing policies  the pricing policies of our competitors and general pricing trends in the consumer electronics market  timing of revenue recognition under our licensing agreements  loss of subscriptions to the tivo service  recruiting and retention of key personnel  and general economic conditions 
because our expenses precede associated revenues  unanticipated shortfalls in revenues could adversely affect our results of operations for any given period and cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and our inability to forecast these trends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
consumer electronic product sales have traditionally been much higher during the holiday shopping season than during other times of the year 
although predicting consumer demand for our products is very difficult  we have experienced that sales of dvrs and new subscriptions to the tivo service have been disproportionately high during the holiday shopping season when compared to other times of the year 
if we are unable to accurately forecast and respond to consumer demand for our products  our reputation and brand will suffer and the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
we expect that a portion of our future revenues will come from targeted commercials and other forms of interactive television advertising enabled by the tivo service 
expenditures by advertisers tend to be seasonal and cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or increase the time it takes to close a sale with our advertisers  which could cause our revenues from advertisements to decline significantly in any given period 
if we are unable to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity  debt or other financing activities on acceptable terms  our ability to effectively manage growth and build a strong brand could be harmed 
we may incur debt to which covenants attach which could be violated if we do not meet our expectations 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through the next twelve months 
however  as we continue to grow our business  we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also incur debt which will subject us to restrictive covenants which if violated by us would cause us to incur penalties and increased expenses which could in turn harm our business 
if we cannot raise necessary additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will decline  stockholders may experience dilution in net book value per share  or these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity securities by the number of authorized  but unissued and unreserved shares of our common stock available for issuance 
any debt financing  if available  may involve covenants limiting  or restricting our operations or future opportunities 
for example  we may seek to leverage our existing and future revenues to raise capital for investing in future subscription growth initiatives 
such financing activities may involve the issuance of debt or other secured instruments tied to current or future revenues that may involve covenants limiting  or restricting our operations or future opportunities or may involve other risks to stockholders 
the large number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price for our stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
several of our stockholders own a substantial number of our shares 

table of contents as of january   options to purchase a total of  shares were outstanding under our option and equity incentive plans  and there were  shares available for future grants 
we have filed registration statements with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our option and equity incentive plans 
future sales of the shares of the common stock  or the registration for sale of such common stock  or the issuance of common stock to satisfy our current or future cash payment obligations or to acquire technology  property  or other businesses  could cause immediate dilution and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the sale or issuance of such stock  as well as the existence of outstanding options and shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our option and equity incentive plans  also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
we expect to continue to experience volatility in our stock price 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile 
since our initial public offering in september through march   our common stock has closed between per share and per share  closing at on march  the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to  among other things  the factors discussed in this section and the following factors changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  our failure to meet  or our ability to exceed  the expectations of securities analysts or investors  release of new or enhanced products or introduction of new marketing initiatives by us or our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of the creation  developments under or termination of significant strategic relationships  joint ventures  significant contracts or acquisitions  fluctuations in the market prices generally for technology and media related stocks  fluctuations in general economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates  market conditions affecting the television and home entertainment industry and the technology sector  fluctuations in operating results  and additions or departures of key personnel 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging companies  and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

securities litigation 
the company and certain of its officers and directors tivo defendants were originally named as defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
this action  which is captioned wercberger v 
tivo et al  also names several of the underwriters involved in the company s initial public offering ipo as defendants 
this class action is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of the company s common stock from the time of the company s ipo october  
table of contents through december  the central allegation in this action is that the underwriters in the company s ipo solicited and received undisclosed commissions from  and entered into undisclosed arrangements with  certain investors who purchased the company s stock in the ipo and the after market  and that the tivo defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose in the ipo prospectus that the underwriters had engaged in these allegedly undisclosed arrangements 
more than issuers have been named in similar lawsuits 
in february  after the issuer defendants including the tivo defendants filed an omnibus motion to dismiss  the court dismissed the section b claim as to the company  but denied the motion to dismiss the section claim as to the company and virtually all of the other issuer defendants 
on october   the company s executive officers who were named as defendants in this action were dismissed without prejudice 
on june   the plaintiffs in the suit announced a proposed settlement with the company and the other issuer defendants 
this proposed settlement was terminated on june   following the ruling by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit on december   reversing the district court s granting of class certification in the six focus cases currently being litigated in this proceeding 
the proposed settlement had provided that the insurers of all settling issuers would guarantee that the plaintiffs recover billion from non settling defendants  including the investment banks who acted as underwriters in those offerings 
under the proposed settlement  in the event that the plaintiffs did not recover at least billion from the non settling defendants  the insurers for the settling issuers would make up the difference  the maximum amount that could be charged to the company s insurance policy under the proposed settlement in the event that the plaintiffs recovered nothing from the investment banks would have been approximately million 
on august   the plaintiffs filed amended master allegations 
on september   the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the focus cases on november  on march   the court ruled on the motion to dismiss  holding that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded their section b claims against the issuer defendants and the underwriter defendants in the focus cases 
as to the section claim  the court dismissed the claims brought by those plaintiffs who sold their securities for a price in excess of the initial offering price  on the grounds that they could not show cognizable damages  and by those who purchased outside the previously certified class period  on the grounds that those claims were time barred 
this ruling  while not binding on the company s case  provides guidance to all of the parties involved in this litigation 
on october  plaintiffs requested that the class certification motion in the focus cases be withdrawn without prejudice 
on friday october   this court signed an order granting that request 
the company may incur expenses in connection with this litigation that may become material in the future

accordingly  the court granted without prejudice the moving issuers joint motion to dismiss  and further held that it would not permit the plaintiff to amend her demand letters 
in regard to the underwriters omnibus motion to dismiss  the court held that the remaining twenty four section b suits were barred by the statute of limitations  and accordingly granted with prejudice the omnibus motion to dismiss as to those suits
