item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we recorded an impairment loss for the year ended december  and may need to record additional charges in the future 
in light of our decisions to discontinue the development of riquent  evaluate the possible sale of our equipment and other personal property assets  reduce our workforce  and consider our strategic alternatives with respect to all aspects of our business  management considered whether  under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  any events or circumstances had occurred since december  and prior to december  that would indicate an impairment of our long lived assets 
after completing our evaluation and considering all external and internal information available as of the impairment analysis  we concluded that  as of december   the carrying amount of the asset group was not fully recoverable and that a material impairment did exist 
accordingly  our financial statements reflect a non cash charge of million for impairment of assets during the fourth quarter of as we continue to evaluate our business and our assets under sfas  we may need to reflect additional impairment charges in the future  which would negatively impact our financial results and our overall value of the company 
we face environmental liabilities related to certain hazardous materials used in our operations 
due to the nature of our manufacturing processes  we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws governing the use  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
historically  in our research and manufacturing activities we have used radioactive and other materials that could be hazardous to human health  safety or the environment 
these materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our facility pending ultimate use and disposal 
the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
although we maintain general liability insurance  we do not specifically insure against environmental liabilities

risk factors related specifically to our stock 
the price of our common stock has been volatile and has declined significantly and we may face delisting from nasdaq 
due to the futility determination of the riquent clinical trial  our stock has experienced significant price and volume volatility during february and march our stock is currently trading below per share and we could continue to experience further declines in our stock price 
our stock is currently trading below the minimum bid price  which is in violation of nasdaq s continued listing requirements 
although nasdaq has suspended the enforcement of rules requiring a minimum closing bid price and the rules requiring a minimum market value of publicly held shares  this suspension is currently only in effect through july  we will likely be non compliant with nasdaq s continued listing requirements when this suspension is lifted 
if our stock continues to trade below when the temporary suspension is lifted  nasdaq may commence delisting procedures against us 
in addition to the minimum bid price rule  the nasdaq global market has several other continued listing requirements 
failure to maintain compliance with any nasdaq listing requirement could cause our stock to be removed from listing on nasdaq 
if we were delisted  the market liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease 
such a delisting could also adversely affect our ability to effect a strategic transaction  such as a merger with a third party 
in addition  our stockholders ability to trade or obtain quotations on our shares could be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays 
these factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask price for our common stock 
specifically  you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for such shares or at all 
in addition  class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price 
any such litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could hurt our business  operating results and financial condition 
our common stock price is volatile and may continue to decline 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including ours  have historically been highly volatile  and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following factors  among others  can have a significant effect on the market price of our securities limited financial resources  announcements regarding mergers or other strategic transactions  future sales of significant amounts of our common stock by us or our stockholders  actions or decisions by the fda and other comparable agencies  announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or others  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of drugs discovered or developed by us or others  developments concerning potential and existing agreements with collaborators  general market conditions and comments by securities analysts  and 
table of contents government regulation  including any legislation that may impact the price of any commercial products that we may seek to sell 
the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year beginning in and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in all future annual reports beginning with the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to report on our internal control over financial reporting 
we evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as of december  in order to comply with section and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to conclude in the future that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section if we fail to achieve and maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
anti takeover devices may prevent changes in our board of directors and management 
we have in place several anti takeover devices  including a stockholder rights plan  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our management or deterring third parties from seeking to acquire significant positions in our common stock 
for example  one anti takeover device provides for a board of directors that is separated into three classes  with their terms in office staggered over three year periods 
this has the effect of delaying a change in control of our board of directors without the cooperation of the incumbent board 
in addition  our bylaws require stockholders to give us written notice of any proposal or director nomination within a specified period of time prior to the annual stockholder meeting  establish certain qualifications for a person to be elected or appointed to the board of directors during the pendency of certain business combination transactions  and do not allow stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders 
we may also issue shares of preferred stock without further stockholder approval and upon terms that our board of directors may determine in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock  and the holders of such preferred stock could have voting  dividend  liquidation and other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock

we lease two adjacent buildings in san diego  california covering a total of approximately  square feet 
one building contains our research and development laboratories and clinical manufacturing facilities and the other contains our corporate offices and warehouse

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition  the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations 
our discussion is organized as follows overview and recent developments 
this section provides a general description of our business and operating history and a general description of recent events and significant transactions that we believe are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
this section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application 
in addition  all of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies and estimates  are summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations by comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  and comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments  both firm and contingent  that existed as of december   as well as material subsequent changes 
included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of our financial capacity to fund our future commitments and a discussion of other financing arrangements 
overview and recent developments since our inception in may  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of technology and potential drugs to treat antibody mediated diseases 
we have never generated any revenue from product sales and have relied on public and private offerings of securities  revenue from collaborative agreements  equipment financings and interest income on invested cash balances for our working capital 
on january   we entered into a development and commercialization agreement the development agreement with biomarin cf limited biomarin cf  a wholly owned subsidiary of biomarin pharmaceutical inc biomarin pharma 
under the terms of the development agreement  biomarin cf was granted co exclusive rights to develop and commercialize riquent in the united states  europe and all other territories of the world  excluding the asia pacific region  and the non exclusive right to manufacture riquent anywhere in the world 
in january  biomarin cf paid us a non refundable commencement payment of million and biomarin pharma purchased million of a newly designated series of our preferred stock 
as described below  this agreement was terminated on march  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
in february  we were informed by an independent monitoring board for the riquent phase aspen study that the monitoring board completed their review of the first interim efficacy analysis of riquent and determined that continuing the study was futile 
we subsequently unblinded the data and found that there was no statistical difference in the primary endpoint  delaying time to renal flare  between the riquent treated group and the placebo treated group  although there was a significant difference in the reduction of antibodies to double stranded dna 
there were renal flares in patients treated with either mg or mg of riquent  and renal flares in patients treated with placebo 
based on these results  we immediately discontinued the riquent phase aspen study and the further development of riquent 
we had previously devoted substantially all of our research  development and clinical efforts and financial resources toward the development of riquent 
in connection with the termination of our clinical 
table of contents trials for riquent  we subsequently initiated steps to significantly reduce our operating costs  including a planned substantial reduction in personnel  which we expect will be effected early in the second quarter of we have also ceased the manufacture of riquent at our facility in san diego  california 
following the futile results of the first interim efficacy analysis of riquent  biomarin cf has elected to not exercise its full license rights to the riquent program under the development agreement 
thus  the development agreement between the parties terminated on march  in accordance with its terms 
pursuant to the securities purchase agreement between us and biomarin pharma  all of the company s preferred shares purchased by biomarin pharma were converted into common shares 
additionally  all rights to riquent have been returned to us 
in light of our decision to discontinue development of our riquent clinical program  we are seeking to maximize the value of our remaining assets 
we are currently evaluating our strategic alternatives  which include the following sell or out license our remaining assets  including our ssao compounds  although we do not expect to receive any significant value for them  pursue potential other strategic transactions  which could include mergers  license agreements or other collaborations  with third parties  or implement an orderly wind down of the company if other alternatives are not deemed viable and in the best interests of the company 
following the negative results of the aspen trial  we recorded a significant charge for the impairment of our riquent assets  including our riquent related patents  and it is unlikely that we will realize any substantive value from these assets in the future 
additionally  there is a substantial risk that we may not successfully implement any of these strategic alternatives  and even if we determine to pursue one or more of these alternatives  we may be unable to do so on acceptable terms 
any such transactions may be highly dilutive to our existing stockholders and may deplete our limited remaining capital resources 
in january  we sold million of face value auction rate securities to our broker dealer  ubs ag ubs 
as of december   we had recognized a total impairment charge of million as a result of the illiquidity of these securities  which was fully offset by a million realized gain from ubs s repurchase agreement that provides for a put option on these securities 
following the sale of these investments  we no longer hold any auction rate securities 
on may   we sold million units the units  where each unit consists of one share of common stock  par value per share and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of approximately per unit  resulting in net proceeds totalling approximately million 
the warrants  which represent the right to acquire a total of million shares of common stock  are exercisable at a price of per share and have a five year term 
certain of our principal stockholders  including affiliates of certain of our directors  purchased an aggregate of approximately million  or approximately  of the units sold 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to patent costs  clinical regulatory expenses and  effective january   the fair value of our financial instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see also note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we regularly review our long lived assets for impairment 
our long lived assets include costs incurred to file our patent applications 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
the estimation of the undiscounted future cash flows associated with long lived assets requires judgment and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual results 
costs related to issued patents are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the remaining useful life of the related technology or the remaining patent life  commencing on the date the patent is issued 
legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with pending patent applications have been capitalized 
we expense all costs related to abandoned patent applications 
if we elect to abandon any of our currently issued or unissued patents  the related expense could be material to our results of operations for the period of abandonment 
the estimation of useful lives for long lived assets requires judgment and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual results 
in addition  our results of operations could be materially impacted if we begin amortizing the costs related to unissued patents 
as a result of the futility determination in the aspen trial  we decided to discontinue the riquent phase aspen study and halt the further development of riquent 
we had previously devoted substantially all of our research  development and clinical efforts and financial resources toward the development of riquent 
therefore  the future cash flows from our riquent related patents are no longer expected to exceed their carrying values 
in addition  during the company expects to sell substantially all of its laboratory equipment  as well as a large portion of its furniture and fixtures and computer equipment and software 
we performed a recoverability test of the long lived assets included in our riquent asset group in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the recoverability test was based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from our long lived assets 
based on the recoverability analysis performed  management does not believe that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the disposition of certain of the company s long lived assets are sufficient to recover the carrying value of these assets 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge for the impairment of long lived assets of million for the year ended december  to write down the value of our long lived assets to their estimated fair values 
we recognized and million in impairment losses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
accrued clinical regulatory expenses we review and accrue clinical trial and regulatory related expenses based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on patient enrollment  sites activated and other events 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a clinical trial can be made 
accrued clinical regulatory costs are subject to revisions as trials progress to completion 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
historically  revisions have not resulted in material changes to research and development costs 
share based compensation we adopted sfas r  share based payment  sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year 
our consolidated statement of operations as of and for the years ended december   and reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated statements of operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the 
table of contents impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based payment awards granted under all equity compensation plans 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we currently expect to recognize the remaining unrecognized compensation cost over a weighted average period of years 
additional share based compensation expense for any new share based payment awards granted after december  under all equity compensation plans cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on  among other matters  the amounts of share based payment awards granted in the future 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because the employee and director stock options granted by us have characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in our opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the employee and director stock options granted by us 
although the fair value of the employee and director stock options granted by us is determined in accordance with sfas r using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
fair value of financial instruments effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
sfas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of this statement impacted our calculation of fair value associated with our investments  specifically our auction rate securities  which became illiquid during the first quarter of in accordance with sfas  we valued these securities using level hierarchical inputs due to the lack of actively traded market data 
these inputs include management s assumptions of pricing by market participants  including assumptions about risk 
we based our fair value determination on estimated discounted future cash flows of interest income over a projected period reflective of the length of time we anticipate it will take the securities to become liquid 
we considered any impairment on these investments to be other than temporary  thus any changes in fair value were recorded to the audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  because we were required to value those securities using only level inputs  our valuation determinations are somewhat subjective and the actual fair values as determined at a later date or by a third party may be different than the fair values we have determined 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  our broker dealer  ubs  offered to repurchase our outstanding auction rate securities at their par value 
we accepted this offer in november and  in january  we sold all of our auction rate securities to ubs at par value of million 
as of december   we had recognized a total impairment charge of million as a result of the illiquidity of these securities  which was fully offset by a million realized gain from ubs s repurchase agreement that provides for a put option on these securities 
see notes and to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of sfas relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the adoption did not have an impact on the audited consolidated financial statements or on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december  on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
at this time  we have not elected to account for any of our financial assets or liabilities using the provisions of sfas as such  the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december  in june  fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf addresses the diversity that exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
under eitf  an entity would defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  on january  we adopted the provisions of eitf  which did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas becomes effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to statement on auditing standards no 
 the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  for periods completed after january  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations years ended december   and research and development expense 
our research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses in from resulted primarily from an increase in clinical trial expenses of approximately million  offset by a decrease in riquent related drug production of million 
research and development expense of million for the year ended december  related to lupus research and development related expense consisting primarily of riquent related clinical trial expenses and clinical 
table of contents drug supply  salaries and other costs related to manufacturing  clinical and research personnel and fees for consulting and professional outside services 
our research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses in from resulted primarily from an increase in riquent related drug production and clinical trial expenses of approximately million 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in expenses in as compared to for the development of our ssao program  as all of our resources were being devoted to the development of riquent and further development of the ssao program depends on our ability to sell  out license or enter into a collaborative arrangement for this program 
we expect that our research and development expense will decrease significantly during as we discontinued the research  development and manufacturing of riquent during february and will be reducing our research and development workforce substantially in the second quarter of because we have not yet ascertained which strategic option we may ultimately pursue  we do not know the specific number of personnel reductions that will be made 
we do expect  however  that the reductions in force will be substantial 
general and administrative expense 
our general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in general and administrative expense in from resulted primarily from an increase in general corporate consulting  professional outside services and salaries and wages of approximately million  primarily as a result of our potential partnering efforts for riquent 
this increase was offset by a decrease in our miscellaneous business expenses related to lower patent abandonments during compared to see patent impairment discussion below and a decrease in depreciation as a result of more assets being fully depreciated in our general and administrative expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease in general and administrative expense in from resulted primarily from a decrease in termination benefits  which for were mainly severance of approximately million and compensation expense of approximately million for accelerated stock option vesting related to the former chairman and chief executive officer s departure in the first quarter of this decrease was partially offset by the increase in the write off of selected patent applications for technologies not related to riquent or our small molecule ssao inhibitors program of approximately million  an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million for stock options granted in and and an increase in consulting expenses for business development and market research of approximately million 
we expect that our general and administrative expense will decrease significantly during as we discontinued the development of riquent during february and will be reducing our general and administrative workforce substantially in the second quarter of asset impairments 
we recorded a million non cash impairment charge in none in and million in because we no longer believe that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the disposition of certain of the company s long lived assets are sufficient to recover the carrying value of these assets 
this impairment charge was due to the negative results from the riquent phase aspen study announced in february  which is an indicator of impairment 
interest income and expense 
our interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for due to lower average balances of cash and short term investments and lower average interest rates on our investments as compared to our interest income was comparable for the years ended december  and interest expense was comparable for the years ended december   and net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards 
at december   we had federal and california income tax net operating loss carryforwards that are subject to section limitations of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards 
in february  we experienced a change in ownership at a time when our enterprise value was minimal 
as a result of this ownership change and the low enterprise value  our federal and california net operating loss carryforwards and federal research and development credit carryforwards as of december  will be subject to limitation under irc section and more likely than not will expire unused 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million and have financed our operations through public and private offerings of securities  revenues from collaborative agreements  equipment financings and interest income on invested cash balances 
from inception through december   we had raised approximately million in net proceeds from sales of equity securities 
on may   we sold million units comprised of million shares of common stock and common stock warrants to purchase an additional million shares for net proceeds totalling approximately million 
the warrants are exercisable at a price of per share and have a five year term 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as compared to million as of december  our working capital as of december  was million  as compared to million as of december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulted from the use of our financial resources to fund our clinical trial and manufacturing activities and for other general corporate purposes 
this decrease is partially offset by the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of million units in may we invest our cash in money market funds invested in us treasury bills  and aaa rated asset backed student loan auction rate securities 
as of december   all of our investments are classified as available for sale securities because we expect to sell them in order to support our current operations regardless of their maturity dates 
as of december   we classified all of our student loan auction rate securities as short term available for sale securities as we will need additional cash in the near term and may be required to liquidate these auction rate securities in order to continue our operations 
as of december   all of our short term available for sale securities have stated maturity dates of more than one year  however  their interest rates are reset periodically within time periods not exceeding days 
in the event we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal until the securities are settled at par by the broker dealer  a future auction on these auction rate securities is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer at par 
as a result  we have recorded a realized impairment loss on these investments in of approximately million 
in november  we accepted a redemption offer by ubs to sell all million of our outstanding auction rate securities ars rights agreement  all of which were maintained by ubs 
as of december   the fair value of the ars rights were recorded as as a realized gain of million and a corresponding short term investment 
the realized gain from recording the ars rights fully offsets the realized impairment loss on auction rate securities that was recorded during see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
during january  all of our auction rate securities were sold to ubs at par value of million see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
in december  we secured a credit facility the credit facility with ubs in the amount of million  fully collateralized by our auction rate securities 
there was no net interest cost to us as the interest rate charged by ubs was contractually equal to the coupon rates of the auction rate securities 
there were no costs related to the establishment of the credit facility 
during december  we drew the full million available under the credit facility  for working capital purposes  of which million was outstanding as of december  during january  the amount outstanding on the credit facility as of december  was settled in full and the credit facility agreement was terminated see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
in january  we entered into a development and commercialization agreement with biomarin cf 
under the terms of the agreement  biomarin cf paid us a non refundable commencement payment of million and biomarin pharma purchased million of series b preferred stock 
on march  and as a result of the termination of the development agreement  the series b preferred stock converted into  shares of common stock 
as of december   approximately million worth of property and equipment million net of depreciation and impairment charges secured our notes payable and capital lease obligations 
we lease our office and laboratory facilities and these leases expire on july  we also lease certain equipment under operating leases 
we have also entered into non cancelable purchase commitments for an aggregate of million with third party manufacturers of materials to be used in the production of riquent  approximately million of
