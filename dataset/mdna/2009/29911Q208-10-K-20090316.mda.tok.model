various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the bank  including state usury laws  laws relating to fiduciaries  consumer credit and equal credit  fair credit reporting  and privacy of non public financial information

the deposits of the bank are insured by the fdic through the insurance fund to the extent provided by law 
under the fdic s risk based insurance system  institutions insured through the insurance fund are currently assessed premiums based on eligible deposits and the institutions capital position and other supervisory factors 
in addition to any insurance fund assessments  banks insured through the insurance fund are subject to fdic assessments to pay certain financing corporation fico obligations 
the assessment is based on eligible deposits and is determined quarterly 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of and regulations thereunder gave the fdic increased flexibility in assessing premiums on banks and savings associations  including the bank  to pay for deposit insurance and in managing its deposit insurance reserves 
under these regulations  all insured depository institutions are placed into one of four risk categories 
the bank is in risk category i  the most favorable category 
as of january   all insured institutions within this category will pay a base rate assessment of to per of deposits for the first quarter of of assessable deposits based on the risk of loss to the insurance fund posed by the particular institution 
institutions  such as the bank  in risk category i will be assessed within a range of to per of deposits for the first quarter of this is a substantial increase from the base rate assessment of to per of assessable deposits that was in effect during the increase in the base rate assessment from to is due to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets 
for institutions such as the bank  which do not have a long term public debt rating  the individual risk assessment is based on its supervisory ratings and certain financial ratios and other measurements of its financial condition 
for institutions that have a long term public debt rating  the individual risk assessment is based on its supervisory ratings and its debt rating 
on february   the fdic issued new rules to take effect april  to change the way the fdic differentiates risk and appropriate assessment rates 
base assessment rates set to take effect on april  will range from to basis points  but giving effect to certain risk adjustments in the rule issued by the fdic on february   assessments may range from to basis points 
for institutions such as the bank  in risk category i  risk adjusted assessments will range from to basis points 
in addition  the fdic also issued an interim rule on february  that will impose an emergency special assessment of basis points in addition to its risk based assessment 
this assessment will be imposed on june  and collected on september  the reform legislation also provided a credit to all insured depository institutions  based on the amount of their insured deposits at year end  that may be used as an offset to the premiums that are assessed 
the bank s credit was fully utilized in to offset its deposit insurance assessment 
due to the full utilization of the bank s credit  the systemic increase in deposit insurance assessments and the emergency special assessment  the bank will be subject to increased deposit premium expenses in future periods 
in  the bank announced that it was electing to participate in the fdic s transaction account guarantee program 
under this program  all non interest bearing transaction accounts and certain low interest now checking accounts are fully guaranteed by the fdic for the entire amount on deposit 
this coverage is in addition to  and separate from  the coverage provided under the fdic s general deposit insurance rules 
the program will remain in effect until december  interest bearing savings accounts and certificates of deposit are not covered accounts under the program  but are insured up to  through december  at the expiration of these programs  it is expected that the fdic insurance limits will return to  on all deposits at eligible institutions 
regulations promulgated by the fdic pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of place limitations on the ability of certain insured depository institutions to accept  renew or rollover deposits by offering rates of interest which are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on deposits offered by other depository institutions having the same type of charter in such depository institutions normal market area 
under these regulations  well capitalized institutions may accept  renew or rollover such deposits without restriction  while adequately capitalized 
table of contents institutions may accept  renew or rollover such deposits with a waiver from the fdic subject to certain restrictions on payment of rates 
undercapitalized institutions may not accept  renew or rollover such deposits 
under the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of  a depository institution insured by the fdic can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with i the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution  or ii any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled fdic insured institution in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver  and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that  in the opinion of the appropriate banking agency  a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
in addition to the forgoing  federal regulators have adopted regulations and examination procedures promoting the safety and soundness of individual institutions by specifically addressing  among other things i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv interest rate exposure  v asset growth  vi ratio of classified assets to capital  vii minimum earnings  and viii compensation and benefits standards for management officials 
federal reserve board s regulations  for example  generally require a holding company to give the federal reserve board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities  if the consideration to be paid  together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations  and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis  if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution 
dividends paid by the bank have been the company s primary source of operating funds and are expected to be for the foreseeable future 
capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank 
under occ regulations  the bank may not pay a dividend  without prior occ approval  if the total amount of all dividends declared during the calendar year  including the proposed dividend  exceed the sum of its retained net income to date during the calendar year and its retained net income over the preceding two years 
as of december   approximately million was available for the payment of dividends without prior occ approval 
the bank s ability to pay dividends is also subject to the bank being in compliance with regulatory capital requirements 
as indicated below  the bank is currently in compliance with these requirements 
because the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank  the company s right to participate in the distribution of assets of the bank in the event of the bank s liquidation or reorganization would be subject to the prior claims of the bank s creditors 
in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of unsecured  non deposit creditors  including a parent bank holding company such as the company or any shareholder or creditor thereof 
the frb  the occ and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers  including the power to terminate deposit insurance  to impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties  and to appoint a conservator or receiver for the assets of a regulated entity 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the company or its subsidiaries  as well as officers  directors and other institution affiliated parties of these organizations  to administrative sanctions and potential civil monetary penalties 
capital adequacy the frb  the fdic and the occ have adopted risk based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks under their supervision 
under these guidelines  the so called tier capital and total capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet instruments must be at least and  respectively 
the frb  the fdic and the occ have also imposed a leverage standard to supplement their risk based ratios 
this leverage standard focuses on a banking institution s ratio of tier capital to average total assets  adjusted for goodwill and certain other items 
under these guidelines  banking institutions that meet certain criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and good earnings  and that have received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of tier capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 
institutions not meeting these criteria  as well as institutions with supervisory  financial or operational weaknesses  along with those experiencing or anticipating significant growth  are expected to maintain a tier capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to at least 
as reflected in the following table  the risk based capital ratios and leverage 
table of contents ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as well capitalized  the highest classification under the regulatory capital guidelines 
capital components and ratios at december  dollars in thousands company bank company bank capital components tier capital total risk based capital risk weighted assets and off balance sheet instruments risk based capital ratio tier capital total risk based capital leverage ratio the federal banking agencies  including the frb and the occ  maintain risk based capital standards in order to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk  the risk of non traditional activities and equity investments in non financial companies  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on certain multifamily housing loans 
bank regulators periodically propose amendments to the risk based capital guidelines and related regulatory framework  and consider changes to the risk based capital standards that could significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the requirements for the capital tiers described below 
while the company s management studies such proposals  the timing of adoption  ultimate form and effect of any such proposed amendments on the company s capital requirements and operations cannot be predicted 
the federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions and their bank holding companies that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
the federal deposit insurance act established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier  or that of its bank holding company  depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures  including a risk based capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure  and certain other factors 
under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies  a bank holding company or bank is considered well capitalized if it has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for a capital measure 
an adequately capitalized bank holding company or bank is defined as one that has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater or or greater in the case of a bank with a composite camels rating of 
a bank holding company or bank is considered a undercapitalized if it has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than or in the case of a bank with a composite camels rating of  b significantly undercapitalized if it has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than  and c critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than 
the frb may reclassify a well capitalized bank holding company or bank as adequately capitalized or subject an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower capital category if it determines that the bank holding company or bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the bank holding company or bank to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have corrected the deficiency 
as of december   the company and the bank met the definition of well capitalized institutions 
undercapitalized depository institutions  among other things  are subject to growth limitations  are prohibited  with certain exceptions  from making capital distributions  are limited in their ability to obtain funding from a federal reserve bank  and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
in addition  for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable  the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan and provide appropriate assurances of performance 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  including if the holding company refuses or is unable to make the guarantee described in the previous sentence  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
failure to submit or implement an acceptable capital plan also is 
table of contents grounds for the appointment of a conservator or a receiver 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of additional requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
moreover  the parent holding company of a significantly undercapitalized depository institution may be ordered to divest itself of the institution or of non bank subsidiaries of the holding company 
critically undercapitalized institutions  among other things  are prohibited from making any payments of principal and interest on subordinated debt  and are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital  minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses  a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares and other standards as they deem appropriate 
the frb and the occ have adopted such standards 
financial services modernization and other recent legislation the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act facilitates the interstate expansion and consolidation of banking organizations by permitting bank holding companies that are adequately capitalized and managed to acquire banks located in states outside their home states  regardless of whether such acquisitions are authorized under the law of the host state 
the riegle neal act also permits interstate mergers of banks  with some limitations  and the establishment of new branches on an interstate basis  provided that such actions are authorized by the law of the host state 
the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate under a common holding company structure 
in addition to allowing new forms of financial services combinations  the glb act clarifies how financial services conglomerates will be regulated by the different federal and state regulators 
the glb act amended the bhca and expanded the permissible activities of certain qualifying bank holding companies  known as financial holding companies 
in addition to engaging in banking and activities closely related to banking  as determined by the frb by regulation or order  financial holding companies may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities that are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
under the glb act  all financial institutions  including the company and the bank  are required to develop privacy policies  restrict the sharing of non public customer data with non affiliated parties at the customer s request  and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access 
usa patriot act the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of the patriot act imposes additional obligations on us financial institutions  including banks and broker dealer subsidiaries  to implement policies  procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to prevent  detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism 
in addition  provisions of the patriot act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions 
the company and its impacted subsidiaries have approved and are implementing policies and procedures that the company believes are compliant with the patriot act 
sarbanes oxley act of since the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of and the sec s implementing regulations of the same collectively  the sarbanes oxley act  companies that have securities registered under the exchange act  including the company  are subject to enhanced and more transparent corporate governance standards  disclosure requirements and accounting and financial reporting requirements 
the sarbanes oxley act  among other things  i requires the principal executive and principal financial officers of a public company to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for the company  and to evaluate the effectiveness of these controls and procedures and certify and report on their findings in the company s periodic reports  a public company to establish and maintain audit committees  comprised solely of independent directors  which committee must be empowered to  among other things  engage  supervise and discharge the company s auditors  that a public company s financial statements be certified by the principal executive and principal financial officers of such company  increased and quicker public disclosure real time of obligations of the company and its directors and officers  including disclosures of off balance sheet transactions and accelerated reporting of transactions in company stock  ii prohibits personal loans to company directors and officers  except certain loans made by insured financial institutions on non 
table of contents preferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements  and iii creates or provides for various increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the securities laws 
monetary policy and economic control the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary policies of the frb 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing  availability of borrowing at the discount window  open market operations  the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks deposits and assets of foreign branches and the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb 
these monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans  investments and deposits  and this use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the monetary policies of the frb have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the monetary policies of these agencies are influenced by various factors  including inflation  unemployment  and short term and long term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the united states government 
future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 
emergency economic stabilization act of there have been historical disruptions in the financial system in recent months and many lenders and financial institutions have reduced or ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other lending institutions 
the availability of credit  confidence in the entire financial sector  and stability in financial markets has been adversely affected 
these disruptions are likely to have some impact on all institutions in the us banking and financial industries 
in response to the financial crises affecting the overall banking system and financial markets  on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was enacted 
under eesa  the us treasury has authority  among other things  to purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
as part of that program  the us treasury has purchased equity interests in a wide variety of eligible banks  thrifts and bank holding companies 
under this program  called the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program tarp  billion of capital has been made available to us financial institutions through the purchase of preferred stock 
the preferred stock would pay a dividend for five years  which will increase to after five years 
in conjunction with its purchase of preferred stock  the treasury also receives warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the amount invested in preferred stock 
participating institutions are required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury continues to hold the institution s equity under tarp 
management evaluated the program to determine whether participation would be advantageous for the company and its common shareholders 
although both the company and the bank meet all applicable regulatory capital requirements and remain well capitalized  on december   the company announced that the company had elected not to participate in the program by a unanimous vote of the board of directors 
factors driving this decision included the lack of exposure to the troubled assets for which the program was originally designed  including subprime mortgages and mortgage backed securities tied to subprime mortgages  dividend restrictions  uncertainty around the management and changing parameters of tarp  and the difficulty in providing adequate return to shareholders with the new capital as the bank was already experiencing high levels of lending activity without the capital from tarp 
the actions described above  together with additional actions announced by the us treasury and other regulatory agencies continue to develop 
it is not clear at this time what long term impact eesa  tarp  other liquidity and funding initiatives of the us treasury and other bank regulatory agencies that have been previously announced  and any additional programs that may be initiated in the future  will have on the financial markets and the financial services industry 
the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced could continue to affect the us banking industry for the foreseeable future

item a 
risk factors the following factors identified by the company s management represent significant potential risks that the company faces in its operations 
the company s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 
since december  the united states has been in a recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are in serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
unemployment has increased significantly 
since mid  and particularly during the second half of  the financial services industry and the securities markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
this was initially triggered by declines in home prices and the values of subprime mortgages  but spread to all mortgage and real estate asset classes  to leveraged bank loans and to nearly all asset classes  including equities 
the global markets have been characterized by substantially increased volatility and short selling and an overall loss of investor confidence  initially in financial institutions  but more recently in companies in a number of other industries and in the broader markets 
market conditions have also led to the failure or merger of a number of prominent financial institutions 
financial institution failures or near failures have resulted in further losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under contracts entered into with such entities as counterparties 
furthermore  declining asset values  defaults on mortgages and consumer loans  and the lack of market and investor confidence  as well as other factors  have all combined to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings  and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity  despite very significant declines in federal reserve borrowing rates and other government actions 
some banks and other lenders have suffered significant losses and have become reluctant to lend  even on a secured basis  due to the increased risk of default and the impact of declining asset values on the value of collateral 
the foregoing has significantly weakened the strength and liquidity of some financial institutions worldwide 
in  the us government  the federal reserve and other regulators have taken numerous steps to increase liquidity and to restore investor confidence  including investing approximately billion in the equity of other banking organizations  but asset values have continued to decline and access to liquidity continues to be very limited 
the company s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent upon on the business 
table of contents environment in the markets where the company operates  in western new york and in the united states as a whole 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  economic growth  efficient capital markets  low inflation  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation or interest rates  natural disasters  or a combination of these or other factors 
overall  during  the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the united states and worldwide 
it is expected that the business environment in western new york  the united states and worldwide will continue to deteriorate for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term 
such conditions could materially adversely affect the credit quality of the company s loans and leases  and therefore  the company s results of operations and financial condition 
direct financing leases expose the company to increased credit risks 
at december   the company s portfolio of direct financing leases originated through enl totaled million  or of total loans and leases outstanding 
the leasing portfolio increased by million  or  from december  the leasing portfolio has been the company s fastest growing segment of its loan and lease portfolio and earns the highest yield compared to other loans that the company offers 
the company is able to earn the relatively higher yield on these leases because of the higher amount of credit risk assumed in the portfolio 
in addition  the leasing portfolio carries a higher risk due to its exposure to certain states that have experienced higher than average credit issues such as california  florida  and texas 
these risks are reflected in the fact that the leases have the highest rate of charge offs among the company s loan and lease portfolio 
as enl is a relatively young company  having commenced operations december   the company has little history to support a projection as to what a long term run rate of charge offs will be 
was the worst economic environment since the company purchased enl and as expected  the worsening economy had a significantly adverse effect on the leasing portfolio 
net charge offs increased from million to million 
a further deterioration in the credit quality of the leasing portfolio could negatively impact earnings and cause the company to further tighten lending standards to lessees  which could significantly slow one of the fastest growing segments of the company s loan portfolio 
this would also impinge future growth in net interest income as the fast growing leasing portfolio has buttressed the company s overall net interest income growth since enl s inception 
at december   the company had million in goodwill associated with enl 
significant declines in the performance of the company s direct financing lease portfolio could result in impairment of that goodwill 
commercial real estate and commercial business loans expose the company to increased credit risks 
at december   the company s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled million  or of total loans and leases outstanding and the company s portfolio of commercial business loans totaled million  or of total loans and leases outstanding 
the company plans to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial loans 
commercial loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of commercial real estate and business loans often depends on the successful operations and the income stream of the borrowers 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
also  many of the company s commercial borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or business loan outstanding with the company 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 
continuing concentration of loans in the company s primary market area may increase the company s risk 
the company s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in western new york state 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  the company provides banking and financial services to customers located primarily in western new york state 
the company s business lending and marketing strategies focus on loans to small to medium sized businesses in this geographic region 
moreover  the company s assets are heavily concentrated in mortgages on properties located in western new york state 
accordingly  the company s business and operations are vulnerable to downturns in the economy of western new york state 
the concentration of the company s loans in this geographic region subjects the company to the risk that a downturn in the economy or recession in this region could result in a decrease in loan originations and increases in delinquencies and foreclosures  which would more greatly affect the company than if the company s lending were more geographically diversified 
in addition  the company may suffer losses if there is a decline in the value of properties underlying the company s mortgage loans which would have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 

table of contents in the event the company s allowance for loan and lease losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses  the company s earnings could decrease 
the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses in order to capture the probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
there is a risk that the company may experience significant loan and lease losses which could exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in determining the amount of the company s recorded allowance  the company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of its loan and lease portfolio  including the creditworthiness of its borrowers  the effect of changes in the local economy on the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans  the effects on the company s loan and lease portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  and the company s loan quality reviews 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review the company s loan and lease portfolio and credit underwriting procedures  as well as its allowance for loan and lease losses  and may require the company to increase its provision for loan and lease losses or recognize further loan and lease charge offs 
at december   the company had a net loan portfolio of approximately million and the allowance for loan and lease losses was approximately million  which represented of the total amount of gross loans and leases 
if the company s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect or bank regulators require the company to increase its provision for loan and lease losses or recognize further loan and lease charge offs  the company may have to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses or loan and lease charge offs which could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurances that the company s allowance for loan and lease losses will be adequate to protect the company against loan and lease losses that it may incur 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
the company s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
because the company s interest bearing liabilities generally re price or mature more quickly than its interest earning assets  an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in its net interest income 
changes in interest rates also affect the value of the company s interest earning assets  and in particular  the company s securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
at december   the company s securities available for sale totaled million 
net unrealized gains on securities available for sale  net of tax  amounted to million and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale  therefore  could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity or earnings 
the company also is subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  the company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
the company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of counterparty relationships 
the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry 
the most important counterparty for the company  in terms of liquidity  is the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny 
the company uses fhlbny as its primary source of overnight funds and also has several long term advances with fhlbny 
at december   the company had a total of million in borrowed funds with fhlbny 
the company has placed sufficient collateral in the form of residential real estate loans at fhlbny 
as a member of the federal home loan bank system  the bank is required to hold stock in fhlbny 
the bank held fhlbny stock worth million as of december  there are branches of the fhlb  including new york 
several members have warned that they have either breached risk based capital requirements or that they are close to breaching those requirements 
to conserve capital  some fhlb branches are suspending dividends  cutting dividend payments  and not buying back excess fhlb stock that members hold 
fhlbny has stated that they expect to be able to continue to pay dividends  redeem excess capital stock  and provide competitively priced advances in the future 
the most severe problems in fhlb have been at some of the other 
table of contents fhlb branches 
nonetheless  the fhlb branches are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
to the extent that one fhlb branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system s debt  other fhlb branches can be called upon to make the payment 
systematic weakness in the fhlb could result in higher costs of fhlb borrowings  reduced value of fhlb stock  and increased demand for alternative sources of liquidity that are more expensive  such as brokered time deposits  the discount window at the federal reserve  or lines of credit with correspondent banks first tennessee and m t bank 
strong competition within the company s market area may limit its growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
the company competes with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally within the company s market area and elsewhere 
many of these competitors whether regional or national institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the company does  and may offer certain services that the company does not or cannot provide 
the company s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in this market area 
expansion of the company s branch network may adversely affect its financial results 
the company has increased its retail branch network from eight branches to twelve branches by opening de novo branches in five of the last six years 
in addition  the company plans on opening another branch in late  and its strategy is to continue to grow its branch network through de novo branching and acquisitions 
the company can not assure that its branch expansion strategy will be accretive to earnings or that it will be accretive to earnings within a reasonable period of time 
numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new branch  such as suitable location  qualified personnel  and an effective marketing strategy 
additionally  it takes time for a new branch to gather sufficient loans and deposits to generate income sufficient to cover its operating expenses 
difficulties the company experiences in implementing its growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
the company is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the occ  frb  and by the fdic  as insurer of its deposits 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors 
regulatory requirements affect the company s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank  the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan and lease losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  could have a material adverse impact on the bank  the company and its business  financial condition and results of operations
