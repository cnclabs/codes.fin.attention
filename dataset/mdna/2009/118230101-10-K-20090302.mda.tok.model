item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of the results for each of buckeye partners 
lp s buckeye operating segments  an overview of its liquidity and capital resources and other items related to buckeye 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item and the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  overview buckeye s primary business strategies are to generate stable cash flows  increase pipeline and terminal throughput and pursue strategic cash flow accretive acquisitions that complement buckeye s existing asset base  improve operating efficiencies  and allow increased cash distributions to unitholders 
buckeye s principal line of business is the transportation  terminalling and storage of petroleum products in the united states for major integrated oil companies  large refined petroleum product marketing companies and major end users of petroleum products on a fee basis through facilities owned and operated by buckeye 
buckeye also operates pipelines owned by third parties under contracts with major integrated oil and chemical companies  and performs certain construction activities  generally for the owners of those third party pipelines 
on january   buckeye acquired lodi gas storage  llc lodi gas 
lodi gas owns and operates a natural gas storage facility in northern california 
lodi gas currently provides approximately billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas storage capacity including capacity provided pursuant to a nearly completed expansion project and is connected to pacific gas and electric s intrastate gas pipelines that service natural gas demand in the san francisco and sacramento areas 
on february   buckeye acquired farm home oil company llc farm home  a seller of refined petroleum products on a wholesale basis  principally in eastern and central pennsylvania 
when farm home was acquired  it also had retail operations  but buckeye sold those operations to a wholly owned subsidiary of inergy  lp on april  the assets and liabilities and results of operations of farm home s retail operations were determined to be discontinued operations effective on the farm home acquisition date of february  on july   farm home was merged with and into its wholly owned subsidiary  buckeye energy services llc bes  with bes continuing as the surviving entity 
this merger did not impact the operations of buckeye 
with the acquisitions of lodi gas and farm home  buckeye determined that it had two additional reportable segments natural gas storage and energy services 
effective in the first quarter of  buckeye conducts business in five reportable operating segments pipeline operations  terminalling and storage  natural gas storage  energy services  and other operations 
see note for a more detailed discussion of buckeye s operating segments 
major items impacting buckeye s results in include income statement contributions from the lodi gas and farm home acquisitions in january and february  respectively  as well as five additional terminal acquisitions in the terminalling and storage and pipeline operations segments in buckeye also made three terminal acquisitions in the terminalling and storage segment during  
table of contents an increase in costs and expenses primarily associated with additional operations resulting from internal growth projects and acquisitions  and a reduction in pipeline operations product transportation volumes of in as compared to balance sheet and capital structure the completion of the seven acquisitions in as set forth above for aggregate consideration of approximately million that were financed with a combination of debt and equity  capital expenditures for internal growth projects of million  the sale of million aggregate principal amount of notes due for net proceeds of million  the sale of approximately million limited partner units in for net proceeds of approximately million  and the replacement of an existing working capital facility assumed in the farm home acquisition with a new million working capital facility that matures in may results of operations consolidated summary buckeye s revenues  operating income and net income increased in compared to  and compared to  primarily due to the expansion of buckeye s operations through acquisitions and to increases in interstate pipeline tariff rates and terminalling throughput fees 
overall pipeline volumes have declined by in as compared to and in as compared to summary operating results for buckeye were as follows year ended december  in thousands revenues costs and expenses operating income other expense income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income buckeye s net income in  and reflects amendments to buckeye s incentive compensation agreement and agreement of limited partnership which recharacterized the incentive compensation paid to buckeye gp from a compensation payment to a partnership distribution  as described in note to buckeye s consolidated financial statements 
these amendments affected buckeye s results of operations in the fourth quarter of and the entire years of and net income for  and was million  million and million  respectively  higher than it would have been if buckeye s incentive compensation agreement and agreement of limited partnership had not been amended 
buckeye s diluted earnings per limited partnership unit lp unit was in compared to in and in 
table of contents consolidated ebitda and adjusted ebitda the following table summarizes ebitda and adjusted ebitda for buckeye for the years ended december   and ebitda  a measure not defined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is defined by buckeye as income from continuing operations before interest expense including amortization and write off of deferred debt financing costs  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda  also a non gaap measure  is defined by buckeye as ebitda plus the general partner incentive compensation expense 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash flow from operations or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda and adjusted ebitda exclude some items that affect net income and these items may vary among other companies  the ebitda and adjusted ebitda data presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies 
buckeye has provided adjusted ebitda in addition to ebitda because  commencing in the fourth quarter of  buckeye reports incentive payments to buckeye gp as partnership distributions  rather than incentive compensation expense  which is how such payments were reported in periods prior to the fourth quarter of see note to buckeye s consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this change 
accordingly  the general partner incentive compensation presented below includes only three quarters of incentive payments for and does not include the million incentive payment paid in the fourth quarter of in and  and future periods thereafter  net income will not include buckeye gp s incentive payments 
management of buckeye uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda as performance measures to assist in the analysis and assessment of buckeye s operations  to evaluate the viability of proposed projects and to determine overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
buckeye believes that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures used by buckeye s management 
consolidated ebitda and adjusted ebitda for each of the years ended december   and  were as follows year ended december  in thousands income from continuing operations interest and debt expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization ebitda general partner incentive compensation adjusted ebitda income from continuing operations and ebitda in include two recurring non cash charges 
first  the accounting rules for leases require in certain instances that base rent payments be combined with future rent increases and the resulting aggregate amount be expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term 
accordingly  lodi gas recorded non cash rental expense with respect to its land leases in the aggregate amount of million in second  in connection with the acquisition of lodi gas  mainline management llc  the general partner of bgh  agreed to forego the senior administrative charge beginning june  and ending march  while no cash payment is required  buckeye has included an expense of million in related to the senior administrative charge 
the forgone payment has been reflected as a reduction in the purchase price of lodi gas 

table of contents segment results revenues  operating income  total costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization by operating segment for each of the three years ended december    and  were as follows year ended december  in thousands revenues pipeline operations terminalling and storage natural gas storage energy services other operations intersegment total operating income pipeline operations terminalling and storage natural gas storage energy services other operations total total costs and expenses including depreciation and amortization pipeline operations terminalling and storage natural gas storage energy services other operations intersegment total deprecation and amortization pipeline operations terminalling and storage natural gas storage energy services other operations total compared to total revenues for the year ended december  were  million  approximately  million greater than total revenue for the same period in of the  million increase  million and  million resulted from the operations of the natural gas storage and energy services segments  respectively 
the balance of the revenue improvement was attributable to the remaining reporting segments as discussed below 

table of contents revenues pipeline operations revenues from pipeline operations were million in  which is an increase of million or from the corresponding period in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in incidental revenues of million principally related to a product supply arrangement along with an increase of million relating to additional construction management and rental revenues  and transportation revenue increased by million in compared to primarily as a result of tariff increases implemented on may  and july  the benefit of the tariff increases were substantially offset by reduced product volumes in as compared to management believes the reduced volumes in the fiscal year were caused primarily by reduced demand for gasoline resulting from higher retail gasoline prices  reduced production at conocophillips wood river refinery due to maintenance activities  and the continued introduction of ethanol into retail gasoline products as well as reduced demand for distillates resulting from higher retail distillate prices and the slowdown in the us economy 
total product volumes declined by in compared to product volumes transported for each of the three years ended december were as follows average barrels per day product gasoline distillate jet fuel lpg s natural gas liquids other products total terminalling and storage revenue from the terminalling and storage segment was million in  which is an increase of million or from the corresponding period in this increase was primarily the result of incremental revenue of million due to the acquisitions of the niles  michigan  ferrysburg  michigan  wethersfield  connecticut  and albany  new york terminals in see note to buckeye s consolidated financial statements  combined with the effect of having a full year of revenue in from the six terminals that were acquired at various times in the first quarter of  an approximate million increase in revenue primarily related to increases in blending fees for product additives and product recoveries from vapor recovery units  which were offset by an approximately decline in throughput volumes  caused in part by increased commodity prices  in compared to  and million from the settlement of a dispute with a customer regarding product handling charges

of the natural gas storage segment s million of outside services costs  approximately million related to well work over costs 
another approximately million is due to increases in activity on operations and maintenance contracts 
the increase in outside services costs were offset by a million decrease in pipeline and terminal maintenance activities compared to  when buckeye experienced a particularly large concentration of these expenses 
outside services costs consist principally of third party contract services for pipeline and terminal maintenance activities 
operating power costs were million for  which is a decrease of million from the decrease is primarily due to lower volumes transported 
operating power consists primarily of electricity required to operate pipeline pumping facilities 
property and other taxes were million in  an increase of million compared to the operations of the natural gas storage and the energy services segments added million and million  respectively  in these increases were offset by a decrease of million due to refunds received for property tax settlements and the phasing out of personal property taxes in ohio

the increase was associated with fuel purchases related to a product supply arrangement in buckeye s pipeline operations segment 
payroll and payroll benefits were million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to the comparable period of increases in salaries and wages of million were attributed to an increase in the number of employees and overtime pay due to buckeye s expanded operations and higher wage rates 
in  buckeye experienced an increase of million in employee incentive compensation expense 
during  buckeye experienced a decrease in payroll benefit expense of approximately million as a result of a reduction of the fair value of buckeye s top up liability under a services agreement with services company  which required buckeye to make cash payments to services company in amounts sufficient for services company s employee stock ownership plan to make payments due under a note agreement 
payroll and payroll benefit expense was offset by another reduction of the fair value of buckeye s top up liability of million in payroll and payroll benefits also increased due to a decrease in capitalized payroll 
table of contents and benefits of million 
approximately million of payroll and payroll benefit expense is related to recent acquisitions 
buckeye experienced an increase of million in major medical costs during these increases were offset by a decrease of million in payroll benefits due to lower employee benefits costs resulting from an amendment to services company s postretirement health care and life insurance benefits plan 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the year ended december   which is primarily due to recent acquisitions and depreciation expense for the entire fiscal year related to the terminal and pipeline at the memphis international airport that began operations in april outside services costs were million for the year ended december   or million greater than the same period in approximately million of the increase is related to recent acquisitions 
approximately million of the increase is related to corporate development and investor relations initiatives 
the remaining increase of million is due to additional pipeline and tank inspections and maintenance work that occurred during operating power costs of million for the year ended december  were million higher than the same period in the increase is primarily due to higher power supply additive expense of million 
the remaining increase of million is due to power rate increases offset by a slight reduction in pipeline volumes 
operating power consists primarily of electricity required to operate pipeline pumping facilities 
property and other taxes increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in approximately million of the increase is related to recent acquisitions 
the remainder of the increase is due to higher real property assessments over the same period in insurance costs and casualty losses were million in  which is an increase of million over the comparable period in approximately million of the increase is due to higher insurance premiums

as a result  buckeye did not record general partner incentive compensation expense in minority interests and other for the year ended december  was million  which is an increase of million compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to a full year of operations of the terminal and pipeline at the memphis international airport by wespac pipelines memphis llc 
liquidity and capital resources general buckeye s traditional sources of liquidity are cash from operations  borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of buckeye s lp units 
buckeye will  from time to time  issue debt securities to permanently finance amounts borrowed under the credit facility 
bes funds its working capital needs principally from operations and a secured credit facility the bes credit agreement 
buckeye s financial policy has been to fund sustaining capital expenditures as described under cash flows from investing activities below with cash from operations 
expansion and cost improvement capital expenditures  along with acquisitions  have typically been funded from external sources including the credit facility as well as debt and equity offerings as described above 
buckeye s goal has been to fund at least half of these expenditures with proceeds from equity offerings in order to maintain and improve its investment grade credit rating 
buckeye s uses of liquidity are capital expenditures  distributions to unitholders and acquisitions as described in cash flows from investing activities below 
during and continuing in  the capital markets have been increasingly affected by overall macroeconomic  liquidity  credit and recessionary concerns 
these concerns culminated in the third and fourth quarters of with a financial credit crisis  with sources of additional external financing either unavailable or available only on unfavorable economic terms 
prior to this credit crisis  buckeye issued additional lp units  debt securities and made additional borrowings under the credit facility in order to fund the lodi gas and farm home acquisitions  make expansion capital expenditures and fund short term working capital needs 
in conjunction with the acquisition of farm home  buckeye assumed farm home s existing working capital facility  but subsequently replaced this facility with the bes credit agreement 
since these financings  buckeye has continued to access the credit facility to fund its short term working capital needs and to fund expansion capital expenditures  while bes continues to access the bes credit agreement in order to fund its working capital needs 
however  because current economic conditions make it more difficult to obtain funding in either the debt or equity markets  and such funding will likely be more expensive  buckeye has taken steps to preserve its liquidity position including maintaining increased cash balances  reducing discretionary capital expenditures and appropriately managing operating and administrative expenditures in order to lower costs and improve profitability 
at december   buckeye had approximately million of available liquidity  including approximately million of cash on hand  as well as approximately million available under the credit facility 
the million availability assumes that lehman brothers fsb  a party to the credit facility  would be able to fulfill its million commitment 
see 
table of contents relationship with lehman brothers below for a discussion of lehman brothers fsb 
in addition  bes had approximately million available under the bes credit agreement  although such availability is subject to borrowing base requirements as discussed under buckeye energy services credit agreement below 
the credit facility matures in august and is subject to two one year extensions at buckeye s option 
the bes credit agreement matures in may buckeye s billion of fixed rate debt matures at various dates commencing in july as a result of buckeye s actions to minimize external financing requirements and the fact that no debt facilities mature prior to  buckeye believes that availabilities under its credit facilities  coupled with ongoing cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund its operations for buckeye will continue to evaluate a variety of financing sources  including the debt and equity markets described above  throughout however  continuing volatility in the debt and equity markets will make the timing and cost of any such potential financing uncertain 
buckeye s financial condition at december    and is highlighted in the following comparative summary as of december  current ratio to to to working capital in thousands ratio of total debt to total capital to to to book value per unit current assets divided by current liabilities current assets minus current liabilities total debt divided by total debt plus total partners capital total partners capital divided by total units outstanding at year end at december   buckeye had  million of debt in the aggregate  which consisted of million of buckeye s notes due the notes  million of notes due the notes  million of buckeye s notes due the notes  million of buckeye s notes due the notes  million of the notes  million outstanding under the credit facility and million outstanding under the bes credit agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the terms of the debt discussed above 
the fair value of buckeye s aggregate debt was estimated to be  million at december  and million at december  the values at december  and december  were based on approximate market value on the respective dates 
credit facility buckeye has a borrowing capacity of million under the credit facility  which may be expanded up to million subject to certain conditions and upon further approval of the lenders 
the credit facility requires buckeye to maintain a specified ratio the funded debt ratio of no greater than to subject to a provision that allows for increases to to in connection with certain future acquisitions 
the funded debt ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated debt by annualized ebitda  which is defined in the credit facility as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization  in each case excluding the income of certain majority owned subsidiaries and equity investments but including distributions from those majority owned subsidiaries and equity investments 
at december   buckeye s funded debt ratio was to at 
table of contents december   buckeye had committed million in support of letters of credit 
the obligations for letters of credit are not reflected as debt on buckeye s consolidated balance sheet 
the weighted average interest rate for borrowing outstanding under the credit facility was at december  in addition  the credit facility contains other covenants including  but not limited to  covenants limiting buckeye s ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create or incur certain liens on its property  to dispose of property material to its operations  and to consolidate  merge  or transfer assets 
at december   buckeye was not aware of any instances of noncompliance with the covenants under its credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the terms of the credit facility 
lehman brothers  fsb  an affiliate of lehman brothers  has committed  as a lender   or million  of buckeye s million borrowing capacity under the credit facility but recently has not honored that commitment 
see below for a further discussion of buckeye s relationships with lehman brothers 
bes credit agreement on may   farm home and bes entered into the bes credit agreement  which was subsequently amended on july  and september  on july   farm home was merged with and into bes  leaving bes as the sole borrower under the bes credit agreement 
the credit facility provided by the bes credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to million  which amount may be increased to million subject to customary conditions  including procurement of the requisite lender commitments 
the bes credit agreement requires bes to meet certain financial covenants  which are summarized below in millions except for leverage ratio borrowings outstanding on bes credit agreement minimum consolidated tangible net worth minimum consolidated net working capital maximum consolidated leverage ratio to above up to to above up to to at december   bes s consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the bes credit agreement and consolidated net working capital as defined in the bes credit agreement were million and million  respectively  and the consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the bes credit agreement was to the weighted average interest rate for borrowing outstanding under the bes credit agreement was at december  in addition  the bes credit agreement contains other covenants  including  but not limited to  covenants limiting bes s ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create or incur certain liens on its property  to consolidate  merge or transfer its assets  to make dividends or distributions  to dispose of its property  to make investments  to modify its risk management policy  or to engage in business activities materially different from those presently conducted

table of contents derivatives see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk non trading instruments for a discussion of commodity derivatives used by buckeye s energy services segment 
in january  buckeye terminated two forward starting interest rate swap agreements associated with the notes and made a payment of million in connection with the termination 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 buckeye has recorded such amount in other comprehensive income and will amortize the amount of the payment into interest expense over the ten year term of the notes 
interest expense increased by million for the year ended december  as a result of the amortization of the termination payment 
in october  buckeye borrowed approximately million under the credit facility 
in order to hedge its variable interest rate risk with respect to the amount borrowed  buckeye concurrently entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of million 
under the swap agreement  buckeye will pay a fixed interest rate of interest of for days and  in exchange  will receive a series of six monthly payments to be calculated based on the day london interbank offered rate libor rate in effect at the beginning of each monthly period 
the amounts received by buckeye will correspond to the day libor rates buckeye expects to pay on the million borrowed under the credit facility 
the swap will settle on the maturity date of the last day libor period 
buckeye designated the swap agreement as a cash flow hedge on december  with changes in value between the trade date and the designation date recognized in earnings 
as of december   million was recognized in earnings related to the differences in the trade and designation date and the ineffectiveness for the hedge period 
in january  buckeye entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement to hedge its variable rate risk on an additional million in borrowing under the credit facility 
under the swap agreement  buckeye will pay a fixed interest rate of for days and  in exchange  will receive a series of six monthly payments to be calculated based on the day libor rate in effect at the beginning of each monthly period 
the amounts received by buckeye will correspond to the day libor rates buckeye expects to pay on the additional million borrowed under the credit facility 
the swap will settle on the maturity date of the last day libor period 
buckeye designated the swap agreement as a cash flow hedge at inception 
for both interest rate swap agreements  buckeye expects the changes in value of the interest rate swap agreements to be highly correlated with the changes in value of the underlying borrowing 
buckeye s financial strategy is to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which involves  among other things  the issuance of additional lp units in connection with buckeye s acquisitions and internal growth activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios  including total debt to total capital 
from through  buckeye has raised net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of its lp units in support of its acquisition and growth strategies 
buckeye may issue additional lp units in and beyond to partially fund acquisitions and internal growth activities  market conditions permitting 
buckeye is subject  however  to changes in the equity markets for its lp units  and there can be no assurance buckeye will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for its lp units in the future 
if buckeye were unable to issue additional lp units  buckeye would be required to either restrict potential future acquisitions or pursue other debt financing alternatives  some of which could involve higher costs 

table of contents relationships with lehman brothers on september   it was reported that lehman brothers filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york 
an affiliate of lehman brothers owned a direct interest in bgh holdings  affiliates of lehman brothers had provided investment and commercial banking and financial advisory services to buckeye  an affiliate of lehman brothers was a lender under the credit facility  and an affiliate of lehman brothers was a customer of lodi gas 
buckeye has considered its relationships with lehman brothers and its affiliates  and for the reasons set forth below  believes the lehman brothers bankruptcy and the possible resulting effects on affiliates of lehman brothers will not have a direct material adverse effect on buckeye 
the bgh holdings interest owned by an affiliate of lehman brothers was a passive investment that did not entitle its holder to any management or other control rights with respect to bgh holdings  mainline management  bgh  buckeye gp  or buckeye 
consequently  buckeye believes that if the interest in bgh holdings is or has been transferred in connection with lehman brothers bankruptcy  such transfer will not adversely impact buckeye 
an affiliate of barclays plc has acquired and is operating the investment banking business and certain financial services businesses of lehman brothers and its affiliates in north america and  as a result  management does not expect any disruption with respect to these services that lehman brothers and its affiliates have provided to buckeye 
lehman brothers  fsb  an affiliate of lehman brothers  has committed  as a lender   or million  of buckeye s million borrowing capacity under the credit facility  but recently has not honored that commitment 
buckeye does not believe that the reduction in capacity under the credit facility resulting from the unavailability of lehman brothers  fsb s commitment will have any impact on buckeye s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
finally  in october  lehman brothers sold the lehman brothers affiliate that is a customer of lodi gas to a third party not affiliated with lehman brothers 
ammonia contract contingencies on november   buckeye gulf coast pipe lines  lp bgc  a subsidiary of buckeye  purchased an ammonia pipeline and other assets from el paso merchant energy petroleum company epme  a subsidiary of el paso corporation el paso 
as part of the transaction  bgc assumed the obligations of epme under several contracts involving monthly purchases and sales of ammonia 
epme and bgc agreed  however  that epme would retain the economic risks and benefits associated with those contracts until their expiration at the end of to effectuate this agreement  bgc passes through to epme both the cost of purchasing ammonia under a supply contract and the proceeds from selling ammonia under three sales contracts 
for the vast majority of monthly periods since the closing of the pipeline acquisition  the pricing terms of the ammonia contracts have resulted in ammonia costs exceeding ammonia sales proceeds 
the amount of the shortfall generally increases as the market price of ammonia increases 
epme has informed bgc that  notwithstanding the parties agreement  it will not continue to pay bgc for shortfalls created by the pass through of ammonia costs in excess of ammonia revenues 
epme encouraged bgc to seek payment by invoking the million guaranty made by el paso which guaranteed epme s obligations to bgc 
if epme fails to reimburse bgc for these shortfalls for a significant period during the remainder of the term of the ammonia agreements  then such unreimbursed shortfalls could exceed the million cap on el paso s guaranty 
to the extent the unreimbursed shortfalls significantly exceed the million cap  the resulting costs incurred by bgc could adversely affect buckeye s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
given the uncertainty of future ammonia prices and epme s future actions  buckeye is unable to estimate the amount of any such losses 
accordingly  buckeye has recorded no provision for losses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because it is unable to determine whether or not a loss has been incurred or  if a loss has been incurred  a reasonable estimate or range of estimates of the 
table of contents amount of such losses 
buckeye is currently assessing its options  including potential recourse against epme and el paso  with respect to this matter 
cash flows from operations the components of cash flows from operations for the years ended december   and were as follows cash flow from operations in thousands income from continuing operations depreciation and amortization net changes in fair value of derivatives minority interests changes in current assets and liabilities changes in non current assets and liabilities cash flows from discontinued operations other total cash flows from operations were million for  which is an increase of million compared to the primary cause of this increase is the improvement in buckeye s income from continuing operations for the period of approximately million 
buckeye s increase in income from continuing operations in is primarily due to its acquisitions of lodi gas and farm home 
cash used by working capital resulted in a decrease of million to cash flows from operations 
the cash provided by discontinued operations in is due to farm home s retail operations prior to their sale 
for the year ended december   cash used by working capital resulted primarily from increases in prepaid and other current assets of million  increases in construction and pipeline relocation receivables of million  increases in inventory of million and decreases in accounts payable of million 
these cash uses were offset by decreases in trade receivables of million and increases in accrued and other current liabilities of million 
the increase in prepaid and other current assets is primarily due to an increase in a receivable related to ammonia purchases as well as additional margin deposits associated with liabilities for derivative instruments 
the increase in construction and pipeline relocation receivables is due to an increase in construction activity in the latter part of the increase in inventories was due to inventory purchases within the energy services segment 
the decrease in accounts payable is due to activity within the energy services segment since the acquisition of farm home 
the reduction of trade receivables is due to an increase in collections within the energy services segment since the acquisition of farm home 
the increase in accrued and other current liabilities is primarily due to increases in accrued taxes  environmental liabilities  interest expense and the value of the derivative liability 
the net change in fair values of derivatives resulted from the significant increase in value related to fixed price sales contracts compared to a lower level of opposite fluctuations in futures contracts purchased to hedge such fluctuations 
buckeye did not hedge a portion of the fixed price sales contracts because it had purchased inventory to fulfill a portion of those commitments 
cash flows from operations were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the primary cause of this increase is the improvement in buckeye s net 
table of contents income for the period of million in compared to as discussed previously  net income in included incentive compensation expense of million 
this increase was offset by a reduction in other non current assets and liabilities of million and an additional million of cash used for working capital 
in  cash used for working capital resulted primarily from a reduction in accounts payable of million which was offset by reductions in trade receivables of million and prepaid and other current assets of million and an increase in accrued and other current liabilities of million 
the reduction in accounts payable is due to the timing of the payment of invoices at year end in as compared to the reduction in trade receivables is due to improvement in the timing of collections 
the reduction in prepaid and other current assets is a result of decreases in insurance receivables from insurance companies related to environmental remediation expenditures and prepaid insurance which were partially offset by increases in prepaid taxes and excise tax receivables 
the increase in accrued and other current liabilities is due to increases in accrued taxes offset by a reduction in environmental liabilities

net repayments under the bes credit agreement and bes s previous credit agreement were million in 
table of contents distributions distributions to unitholders increased to million in compared to million in and million in distributions in increased over primarily as a result of increases in the unit distribution rate and the issuance of the million lp units in distributions in increased over primarily as a result of increases in the unit distribution rate and the issuance of the million lp units in additionally  distributions increased in over by million as a result of incentive payments to buckeye gp being treated as distributions rather than compensation payments beginning in the fourth quarter of other financing operating leases buckeye leases certain land and rights of way in connection with the operations of its pipelines 
minimum future lease payments for these leases as of december  are approximately million for each of the next five years 
substantially all of these lease payments can be canceled at any time should they not be required for operations 
buckeye leases certain other land and space in office buildings 
future minimum lease payments under these non cancelable operating leases at december  are approximately million for  million for  million for  million for  million for  and million in the aggregate thereafter 
buckeye has leases for subsurface underground gas storage rights and surface rights in connection with its operations in the natural gas storage segment 
these leases may be cancelled by buckeye if the storage reservoir is not used for underground storage of natural gas or the removal or injection thereof for a continuous period of two consecutive years 
lease payments for the year ended december  were million 
lease expense associated with these leases is being recognized on a straight line basis over years 
for the year ended december   the natural gas storage segment s lease expense was approximately million  including million recorded as an increase in buckeye s deferred lease liability 
buckeye gp estimates that the deferred lease liability will continue to increase through  at which time buckeye s deferred lease liability is estimated to be approximately million 
buckeye s deferred lease liability will then be reduced over the remaining years of the lease  since the expected annual lease payments will exceed the amount of lease expense 
future minimum lease payments for subsurface underground gas storage and mineral rights by year as of december   are as follows years ending december  in thousands thereafter total rent expense under operating leases was million  million and million for  and  respectively

interest on buckeye s variable rate obligations the credit facility and the bes credit agreement is not included in the table above because the amounts outstanding and the related interest rates cannot be predicted 
in  buckeye paid interest of approximately million on the credit facility and million on the bes credit agreement 
the weighted average interest rates for borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the bes credit agreement were and  respectively  at december  purchase obligations generally represent commitments for recurring operating expenses or capital projects 
in addition  buckeye s obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans are discussed in note to buckeye s consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters buckeye is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations  as well as buckeye s own standards relating to protection of the environment  cause buckeye to incur current and ongoing operating and capital expenditures 
environmental expenses are incurred in connection with emergency response activities associated with the release of petroleum products to the environment from buckeye s pipelines and terminals  and in connection with longer term environmental remediation efforts which may involve  for example  groundwater monitoring and treatment 
buckeye regularly incurs expenses in connection with these environmental remediation activities 
in  buckeye incurred operating expenses of million and at december  had million accrued for environmental matters 
at december   buckeye estimates that approximately million of environmental expenditures incurred will be covered by insurance 
these recovery amounts have not been included in expense in buckeye s financial statements 
buckeye maintains environmental liability insurance covering all of its pipelines and terminals with a per occurrence deductible in the amount of million 
expenditures  both capital and operating  relating to environmental matters are expected to continue due to buckeye s commitment to maintaining high environmental standards and complying with increasingly rigorous environmental laws 

table of contents employee stock ownership plan services company provides an employee stock ownership plan the esop to the majority of its regular full time employees hired before september  employees hired by services company after such date do not participate in the esop 
the esop owns all of the outstanding common stock of services company 
as of december   services company owned  lp units 
as of the same date  the esop was directly obligated to a third party lender for million of notes due the esop notes 
the esop notes were issued on may  to refinance services company s notes which were originally issued to purchase services company common stock 
the esop notes are secured by  shares of services company s common stock 
buckeye has committed that  in the event that the value of the lp units owned by services company falls to less than of the balance payable under the esop notes  buckeye will fund an escrow account with sufficient assets to bring the value of the total collateral the value of the lp units owned by services company and the escrow account up to the minimum 
amounts deposited in the escrow account are returned to buckeye when the value of the lp units owned by services company returns to an amount which exceeds the minimum 
at december   the value of the lp units was approximately million  which exceeded the minimum requirement 
services company common stock is released to employee accounts in the proportion that current payments of principal and interest on the esop notes bear to the total of all principal and interest payments due under the esop notes 
individual employees are allocated shares based on the ratio of their eligible compensation to total eligible compensation 
eligible compensation generally includes base salary  overtime payments and certain bonuses 
buckeye contributed million lp units to services company in august in exchange for the elimination of buckeye s obligation to reimburse its general partner and the parent of its general partner for certain executive compensation costs  a reduction of the incentive compensation paid by buckeye to its general partner  and other changes that made the esop a less expensive fringe benefit for buckeye 
effective january  buckeye and its operating subsidiaries have agreed to pay for all executive compensation and benefits earned by buckeye gp s four highest salaried officers in return for an annual fixed payment from bgh 
funding for the esop notes is provided by distributions that services company receives on the lp units that it owns and from cash payments from buckeye  which are required to cover any shortfall between the distributions that services company receives on the lp units that it owns and amounts currently due under the esop notes the top up reserve  except that buckeye has no obligation to fund the accelerated portion of the esop notes upon a default 
buckeye also incurs routine esop related administrative costs and taxes associated with taxable income incurred on the sale of lp units  if any 
in  and  esop costs were reduced by million  million and million  respectively  as estimates of future shortfalls between the distributions that services company receives on the lp units that it owns and amounts currently due under the esop notes were reduced to reflect higher distributions on the lp units than was previously anticipated 
off balance sheet arrangements buckeye has no off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to select appropriate accounting principles from those available  to apply those principles consistently and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect revenues and associated costs as well as reported amounts of assets and 
table of contents liabilities 
the following describes the estimated risks underlying buckeye s critical accounting policies and estimates depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment consist primarily of pipelines  wells  storage and terminal facilities  pad gas and pumping and compression equipment 
for financial reporting purposes  depreciation on pipelines and terminals is generally calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
property  plant and equipment are generally recorded at cost and their carrying value accounted for approximately of buckeye s consolidated assets at december  depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost or fair value  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
straight line depreciation results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset 
the determination of an asset s useful life requires assumptions regarding a number of factors including technological change  normal depreciation and actual physical usage 
if any of these assumptions subsequently change  the estimated useful life of the asset could change and result in an increase or decrease in depreciation expense that could have a material impact on buckeye s financial statements 
at december  and  the net book value of buckeye s consolidated property  plant and equipment was billion and billion  respectively 
depreciation expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
buckeye does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimated useful life of these assets 
in the past  buckeye has generally not deemed it necessary to materially change the depreciable lives of its assets 
however  a reduction in the depreciable life of these assets  from to years  would increase annual depreciation expense  and reduce operating income by approximately million annually 
reserves for environmental matters as discussed under environmental matters above  buckeye is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
expenditures that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations  and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation  are expensed 
liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or clean ups are probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated based upon past experience and advice of outside engineering  consulting and law firms 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with buckeye s commitment to a formal plan of action 
accrued environmental remediation related expenses include estimates of direct costs of remediation and indirect costs related to the remediation effort  such as compensation and benefits for employees directly involved in the remediation activities and fees paid to outside engineering  consulting and law firms 
historically  buckeye s estimates of direct and indirect costs related to remediation efforts have generally not required material adjustments 
however the accounting estimates relative to environmental matters are uncertain because estimated future expenditures related to environmental matters are subject to cost fluctuations and can change materially  unanticipated liabilities may arise in connection with environmental remediation projects and may impact cost estimates  and changes in federal  state and local environmental regulations can significantly increase the cost or potential liabilities related to environmental matters 
buckeye maintains insurance which may cover certain environmental expenditures 
during  and  buckeye incurred environmental related operating expenses  net of insurance recoveries  of million  million and million  respectively 
at december  and  buckeye had accrued million and million  respectively  for environmental matters 
the environmental accruals are revised as new matters arise  or as new facts in connection with environmental remediation 
table of contents projects require a revision of estimates previously made with respect to the probable cost of such remediation projects 
changes in estimates of environmental remediation for each remediation project will affect operating income on a dollar for dollar basis up to buckeye s self insurance limit 
buckeye s self insurance limit is currently million per occurrence 
fair value of derivatives and fixed price sales contracts buckeye s energy services segment primarily uses exchange traded petroleum futures contracts to manage the risk of market price volatility on its refined petroleum product inventories and its fixed price sales contracts 
the energy services segment has elected not to use hedge accounting with respect to its fixed price sales contracts 
therefore  its fixed price sales contracts and the related futures contracts used to offset those fixed price sales contracts are all marked to market on buckeye s balance sheet with gains and losses being recognized in earnings during the period 
as a result  the valuations associated with these derivative instruments  including the fixed price sales contracts  have a material impact on net income 
at december   buckeye included in its financial statements as assets fixed price sales contracts with values of approximately million 
these fair values resulted from the increasingly large differences between the fixed prices called for in the sales contracts and current prices available in spot markets 
offsetting the value of these fixed price sales contracts were futures contracts with values of approximately million which were recognized as liabilities 
buckeye has determined that the exchange traded futures contracts represent level fair value measurements  as described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
fair value measurements sfas because the prices for such futures contracts are established on liquid exchanges with willing buyers and sellers and with prices which are readily available on a daily basis 
buckeye has determined that the fixed price sales contracts represent level fair value measurements under sfas because their value is derived from similar contracts for similar delivery and settlement terms which are traded on established exchanges 
however  because the fixed price sales contracts are privately negotiated with customers of the energy services segment who are generally  private companies that do not have credit ratings established by nationally recognized ratings agencies  the determination of an adjustment to fair value to reflect counterparty credit risk a credit valuation adjustment requires significant management judgment 
at december   due to a credit valuation adjustment  buckeye had reduced the fair value of the fixed price sales contracts by million to reflect this counterparty credit risk 
the delivery periods for the contracts range from one to months  with the substantial amount of deliveries concentrated in the first four months of because little or no public credit information is available for the energy services segment s customers who have fixed price sales contracts  buckeye specifically analyzed each customer and contract to evaluate i the historical payment patterns of the customer  ii the current outstanding receivables balances for each customer and contract and iii the level of performance of each customer with respect to volumes called for in the contract 
buckeye then evaluated the specific risks and expected outcomes of nonpayment or nonperformance by each customer and contract 
based on its credit and performance risk evaluation  buckeye recorded the credit valuation adjustment of million 
if actual customer performance under these fixed price sales contracts deteriorates either through nonperformance with respect to contracted volumes or nonpayment of amounts due  then the fair value of these contracts could be materially less 
for example  a one percent shortfall in delivered volumes over the average life of the contracts would reduce the fair value of the contracts and  accordingly  net income  by million 
buckeye continues to monitor and evaluate performance and collections with respect to these fixed price sales contracts 

table of contents accounting for goodwill and assessment of goodwill impairment prior to  buckeye had limited amounts of goodwill reported on its balance sheet 
the amount of goodwill reported increased substantially in as a result of the acquisitions of lodi gas  farm home and the ethanol and petroleum products terminal in albany  new york 
the initial recording of goodwill resulted from management s allocation of the purchase price of these businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations 
sfas 
the application of sfas requires that the total purchase price be allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on an assessment of their fair values at the acquisition date  with amounts exceeding the fair values being recorded as goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over such useful lives 
as a result  significant management judgment is required in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  including the determination if any intangible assets have been acquired and  if so  if such intangible assets have definite or indefinite useful lives 
for intangible assets that are not indefinite  additional judgment is required in assessing such intangible asset s estimate useful life 
subsequent to the initial recording of goodwill  sfas requires management  at least annually  to assess goodwill for impairment using a two step methodology 
the initial step requires buckeye management to determine the fair value of each of its reporting units and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
however  a carrying value that exceeds fair value may be an indication of impaired goodwill 
the amount  if any  of the impairment would then be measured and an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment testing performed annually on january has resulted in the determination that no impairment had been incurred in  or the determination of whether goodwill is impaired is based on management s estimate of the fair value of buckeye s reporting units at each measurement date compared to their carrying values 
in the impairment test  buckeye utilized industry specific multiples of ebitda to determine the terminal values of each of its reporting units 
these multiples require significant management judgment applied to each reporting unit 
management used ebitda multiples that it believed were reasonable based on its experience in the acquisition of similar assets in the context of current market conditions 
in the determination of estimated useful lives of intangible assets with finite lives  management considered relevant factors of useful life including  with respect to customer intangibles  the historical attrition rates for each customer

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk trading instruments buckeye has no trading derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activity with respect to trading instruments 
market risk non trading instruments buckeye is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
buckeye does not currently have foreign exchange risk 
commodity risk the energy services segment primarily uses exchange traded petroleum futures contracts to manage the risk of market price volatility on its refined petroleum product inventories and its fixed price sales contracts 
the derivative contracts used to hedge refined petroleum product inventories are classified as fair value hedges 
accordingly  buckeye s method of measuring ineffectiveness will compare 
table of contents the changes in the fair value of the new york mercantile exchange futures contracts to the change in fair value of buckeye s hedged fuel inventory 
any difference between the amounts will be considered ineffectiveness and recorded in current period earnings 
the energy services segment has elected not to use hedge accounting with respect to its fixed price sales contracts 
therefore  its fixed price sales contracts and the related futures contracts used to offset those fixed price sales contracts are all marked to market on the balance sheet with gains and losses being recognized in earnings during the period 
as of december   the energy services segment had derivative assets and liabilities as follows december  in thousands assets fixed price sales contracts futures contracts for inventory liability futures contracts for fixed price sales contracts total all but million of the assets noted above for unrealized gains of million related to inventory hedges will be realized in the first quarter of as the related inventory is sold 
gains recorded on inventory hedges that were ineffective were approximately million 
as of december   open petroleum derivative contracts represented by the fixed price sales contracts and futures contracts for fixed price sales contracts noted above varied in duration  but did not extend beyond june in addition  buckeye had on hand at december  refined product inventories which it intends to use to satisfy a portion of the fixed price sales contracts 
based on a hypothetical movement in the underlying quoted market prices of the commodity financial instruments outstanding at december   the estimated fair value of the portfolio of commodity financial instruments would be as follows scenerio resulting classification commodity financial instrument portfolio fair value in thousands fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices as is asset  fair value assuming increase in underlying commodity prices asset  fair value assuming decrease in underlying commodity prices asset  the value of the open futures contract positions noted above were based upon quoted market prices obtained from the new york mercantile exchange 
the value of the fixed price sales contracts was based on observable market data related to the obligation to provide refined petroleum products to customers 
interest rate risk from time to time  buckeye uses interest rate derivatives to hedge interest obligations on specific debt issuances  including anticipated debt issuances 
buckeye s practice with respect to derivative 
table of contents transactions related to interest rate risk has been to have each transaction in connection with non routine borrowings authorized by the board of directors of buckeye gp 
in january  buckeye gp s board of directors adopted an interest rate hedging policy which permits buckeye to enter into certain short term interest rate hedge agreements to manage its interest rate and cash flow risks associated with the credit facility 
buckeye is exposed to fair value risk with respect to its fixed rate debt obligations and to cash flow risk with respect to its variable rate obligations 
fair value risk represents the risk that the value of buckeye s fixed rate debt obligations will rise or fall depending on changes in interest rates 
cash flow risk represents the risk that interest expense related to the variable rate obligations will rise or fall depending on changes in interest rates 
at december   buckeye had total fixed rate debt obligations at face value of  million  consisting of million of the notes  million of the notes  million of the notes  million of the notes and million of the notes 
the fair value of these fixed rate debt obligations at december  was approximately million 
buckeye estimates that a decrease in rates for obligations of similar maturities would increase the fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations by million 
buckeye s variable rate obligation was million under the credit facility and million under the bes credit agreement at december  based on the balances outstanding at december   a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by million
