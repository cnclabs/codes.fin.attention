executive summary the subprime crisis that began in mid evolved into a broad based economic crisis in against a backdrop of declining values in the capital and real estate markets  our financial performance was highlighted by the growth of our loan portfolio  the expansion of our net interest margin  and an increase in net interest income  our primary earnings source 
while the details of our performance are discussed at length in the following pages  below is a brief summary of the year s achievements  and the impact on our performance of the weakened economy 
a significant level of loan production and loan growth the decline in competition that began with the departure of the conduit lenders in the second half of continued with the departure of certain other major competitors in capitalizing on the decline in competition  we increased the volume of loans we produced to more traditional levels  together with the spreads on our multi family and commercial real estate cre loans 
loan originations totaled billion in  representing a increase from billion in the prior year 
multi family loans accounted for billion of our originations and were up from the year earlier amount 
with repayments having declined as refinancing activity dwindled  our loan portfolio grew year over year to billion  partly reflecting an increase in multi family loans to billion 
a reduction in funding costs in an attempt to encourage banks to lend and consumers to borrow  the federal open market committee the fomc reduced the target federal funds rate seven times in  from a high of at the start of january to a range of zero to on december th 
we capitalized on the decline in short term rates by reducing our cost of funds over the course of the year 
in the second quarter of  in particular  we prepaid billion of wholesale and other borrowed funds with an average interest rate of and replaced them with billion of lower cost wholesale borrowings 
the debt repositioning resulted in a pre tax charge of million  of which million was recorded as interest expense 
the remaining million of the charge was recorded as non interest expense 
while the after tax impact of the million charge reduced our second quarter and full year earnings by million  or per diluted share  the benefits of the debt repositioning were apparent in the third and fourth quarters  when the resultant decline in our funding costs contributed to the expansion of our margin and a meaningful increase in our net interest income 
margin expansion and higher net interest income the combination of lower funding costs and increased loan production resulted in the expansion of our margin and a significant level of net interest income growth in these accomplishments were achieved despite a reduction in prepayment penalty income  as fewer of our borrowers opted to refinance  and despite the impact of the million debt repositioning charge 
at  our net interest margin was ten basis points wider than the year earlier measure  and at million  our net interest income was million  or  higher than the year earlier amount 
the benefit of our loan growth and the reduction in funding costs is more readily apparent in a comparison of our margins and net interest income for the fourth quarters of and at  our fourth quarter margin was basis 
table of contents points wider than the year earlier fourth quarter measure  at million  our fourth quarter net interest income was million  or  higher than the net interest income we recorded in the year earlier three months 
asset quality although the impact of the economic crisis was greater in other parts of the country  the region we serve nonetheless experienced a decline in real estate values  a rise in unemployment and bankruptcies  and an increase in office vacancies in against this backdrop  non performing assets rose from million  representing of total assets  at december   to million  representing of total assets  at december  included in the respective amounts were non performing loans of million and million  representing and of total loans 
the increase in non performing loans and assets was not specific to any one lending niche 
net charge offs rose to million in from  in  and represented and of average loans in the respective years 
unlike the increase in non performing loans  which was broad based in nature  the increase in net charge offs was largely driven by losses on commercial and industrial c i  consumer  and acquisition development  and construction adc loans 
notwithstanding the increases in our asset quality measures  we continued to compare favorably with our industry peers 
in view of the decline in real estate values and the increasing weakness in the market  we limited our adc loan originations to advances that had been committed before the onset of the economic crisis  and also reduced the size of our c i loan portfolio 
as a result  adc and c i loans represented and of total loans at the end of december  as compared to and  respectively  at the prior year end 
capital strength on may   we issued  shares of common stock in an oversubscribed secondary common stock offering  which generated net proceeds of million 
the capital raised in the offering more than offset the reduction in capital that stemmed from the million after tax debt repositioning charge recorded in the second quarter 
in the second half of  the repositioning of our debt contributed to the expansion of our net interest margin and net interest income  and thus to the growth of our earnings and capital 
stockholders equity rose million year over year  to billion  and represented of total assets at december   while tangible stockholders equity rose million to billion  representing of tangible assets at that date 
the growth of our stockholders equity and tangible stockholders equity was tempered by the distribution of quarterly cash dividends totaling million  and by two factors relating to the dramatic collapse of the capital markets a million increase in net unrealized securities losses to million  and a million rise in the unrecognized loss related to the funded status of our pension and post retirement plans to million 
excluding the combined impact of these capital charges  tangible stockholders equity represented of tangible assets at december  please see the reconciliations of our stockholders equity and tangible stockholders equity  total assets and tangible assets  and the related capital measures on page of this report 
in view of our continued capital strength  and our proven ability to raise capital when needed  we declined the opportunity to accept an infusion of capital under the capital purchase program of the us treasury s troubled asset relief program tarp on january  the collapse of the capital markets the collapse of the capital markets that began with the failure of bear stearns in march accelerated in september with the demise of lehman brothers holdings  inc lehman brothers 
what followed was an economic decline of unparalleled proportions  as significant losses at several financial industry giants contributed to an environment of fear and volatility 

table of contents the collapse of the capital markets also had an impact on industry earnings  as many of the nation s banks and thrifts had investments in lehman brothers  and other financial institutions  including the government sponsored enterprises  freddie mac and fannie mae 
our exposure to these firms was limited as compared to many others 
nonetheless  we recorded a million other than temporary impairment otti charge on our investments in lehman brothers and a million otti charge on our investment in freddie mac in reflecting these and certain other investments that were impacted by the broad decline in the capital markets  we recorded a total otti charge of million in  as compared to million in the prior year 
on an after tax basis  the charges reduced our earnings by million  or per diluted share 
our earnings while our net interest income rose and our net interest margin expanded from the year earlier measures  the favorable impact on our earnings was masked by the adverse impact of the debt repositioning charge we recorded in the second quarter and the otti charges we recorded in the last three quarters of the year 
the combined charges reduced our full year earnings by million to million  and reduced our full year basic and diluted earnings per share by to 
government intervention to energize the economy and foster stability in the financial and capital markets  a series of new laws were enacted by congress and implemented by various us government agencies beginning in while we chose not to participate in the us treasury s capital purchase program  despite our application having received approval  we opted into both components of the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp 
under the tlgp  non interest bearing transaction accounts will receive unlimited insurance coverage through the end of this coming december  and certain senior unsecured debt issued between october  and june  will be guaranteed by the fdic through june  in december  we issued million of fixed rate senior notes that will mature in june  and the community bank issued an additional million of senior notes that will mature in december the notes are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
while the fdic raised the level of deposits it insures from  to  per account in  to calm the fears of an increasingly unsettled public  it also increased the assessment fees paid by banks  beginning in the increased fees will be in addition to an annual assessment rate of basis points on the senior notes issued under the tlgp in december  and will increase our operating expenses in recent events tarp funds declined on january   the board of directors declined a capital infusion that had been offered on december  by the us treasury under the capital purchase program of the tarp of the emergency economic stabilization act of dividend declaration on january   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as being critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critically important to the portrayal of our financial condition  since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  and the judgments  estimates  and assumptions used therein  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the determination of whether an impairment on securities is other than temporary  the determination of the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment  and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the judgments used by management in applying the critical accounting policies discussed below may be affected by a further and prolonged deterioration in the economic environment  which may result in changes to future financial results 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings  and is reduced by net charge offs and or reversals  if any  that are credited to earnings 
a separate loan loss allowance is established for the community bank and the commercial bank and  except as otherwise noted below  the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses is the same for each 
management establishes the allowances for loan losses through an assessment of probable losses in each of the respective loan portfolios 
several factors are considered in this process  including the level of defaulted loans at the close of each quarter  recent trends in loan performance  historical levels of loan losses  the factors underlying such loan losses and loan defaults  projected default rates and loss severities  internal risk ratings  loan size  economic  industry  and environmental factors  and loan impairment  as defined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
under sfas no 
 a loan is classified as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both the principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we apply sfas no 
as necessary to certain larger multi family  cre  adc  and c i loans  and exclude smaller balance homogenous loans and loans carried at the lower of cost or fair value  if any 
we measure impairment of a collateral dependent loan based on the fair value of the collateral  less the estimated cost to sell 
for loans that are not collateral dependent  impairment is measured by using the present value of expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
a valuation allowance is established when the fair value of the collateral  net of estimated costs  or the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
impaired loans totaled million at december   we had no impaired loans at december  in addition  the process of determining the appropriate levels for the banks loan loss allowances for those loans not considered for impairment under sfas no 
includes  but is not limited to periodic inspections of the loan collateral by qualified in house property appraisers inspectors  as applicable  regular meetings of executive management with the pertinent board committee  during which observable trends in the local economy and or the real estate market are discussed  assessment by the pertinent board of directors of the aforementioned factors when making a business judgment regarding the impact of anticipated changes of the future level of the allowance for loan losses  and analysis of the portfolio in the aggregate  as well as on an individual loan basis  taking into consideration payment history  underwriting analyses  and internal risk ratings 
in establishing the loan loss allowances  management also considers the banks current business strategies and credit processes  including compliance with conservative guidelines established by the respective boards of directors with regard to credit limitations  loan approvals  underwriting criteria  and loan workout procedures 
in accordance with the pertinent policies  the loan loss allowances are segmented to correspond to the various types of loans in the loan portfolios 
these loan categories are assessed with specific emphasis on the internal risk ratings  underlying collateral  credit underwriting  and loan type  and these factors correspond to the respective levels of quantified and inherent risk 

table of contents the assessments take into consideration loans that have been adversely rated  primarily through the valuation of the collateral supporting each loan 
adversely rated loans are loans that are either non performing or that exhibit certain weaknesses that could jeopardize payment in accordance with the original terms 
larger loans are assigned risk ratings based upon a periodic review of the credit files  while smaller loans exceeding days in arrears are assigned risk ratings based upon an aging schedule 
quantified risk factors are assigned for each risk rating category to provide an allocation to the overall loan loss allowance 
the remainder of each loan portfolio is then assessed  by loan type  with similar risk factors being considered  including the borrower s ability to pay and our past loan loss experience with each type of loan 
these loans are also assigned quantified risk factors  which result in allocations to the allowances for loan losses for each particular loan or loan type in the portfolio 
in order to determine their overall adequacy  each of the respective loan loss allowances is reviewed quarterly by management and by the mortgage and real estate committee of the community bank s board of directors or the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank  as applicable 
while management uses the best available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the respective loan loss allowances may be necessary  based on changes in economic and local market conditions beyond management s control  including declines in real estate values  and increases in vacancy rates and unemployment 
in addition  the community bank and or the commercial bank may be required to take certain charge offs and or recognize additions to their loan loss allowances  based on the judgment of regulatory agencies with regard to information provided to them during their examinations 
we recognize interest income on loans using the interest method over the life of the loan 
using this method  we defer certain loan origination and commitment fees  and certain loan origination costs  and amortize the net fee or cost as an adjustment to the loan yield over the term of the related loan 
when a loan is sold or repays  the remaining net unamortized fee or cost is recognized in interest income 
a loan generally is classified as a non accrual loan when it is days past due 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  the company ceases the accrual of interest owed  and previously accrued interest is charged against interest income 
a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is less than days past due and or the company has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible 
interest income on non accrual loans is recorded when received in cash 
investment securities the securities portfolio primarily consists of mortgage related securities and  to a lesser extent  debt and equity other securities 
securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at their estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
the fair values of our securities and particularly our fixed rate securities are affected by changes in market interest rates and spreads 
in general  as interest rates rise  the fair value of fixed rate securities will decline  as interest rates fall  the fair value of fixed rate securities will increase 
we conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its carrying value is other than temporary 
if we deem any decline in value to be other than temporary  the security is written down to its current fair value  creating a new cost basis  and the resultant loss is charged against earnings and recorded in non interest income 
at december   the net unrealized losses on available for sale and held to maturity securities were million and million  respectively 
this impairment was deemed to be temporary based on the direct relationship of the decline in fair value to the movements in interest rates  including wider credit spreads in some cases  the effect of illiquidity on the market  the estimated remaining life and the credit quality of the investments  and our ability and intent to hold these investments until there is a full recovery of the unrealized loss  which may not be until maturity 
during  we recorded charges of million for the otti of certain capital trust notes  equity securities  and corporate bonds 
included in this amount were charges of million relating to our investment in the corporate bonds and perpetual preferred stock of lehman brothers  and million relating to our investment in freddie mac perpetual preferred stock 

table of contents management s conclusion that these securities were other than temporarily impaired was based on the significant decline in their fair values  and the unlikelihood of recovering the unrealized losses within a reasonable period of time 
to the extent that continued changes in interest rates  credit quality  and other factors that influence the fair value of investments occur  we may be required to record additional charges for the otti of securities in future periods 
goodwill impairment goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment  rather than amortized  at the reporting unit level  at least once a year 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step step is used to identify potential impairment  and involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step step is performed to measure the amount 
step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which impairment was indicated in step the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination  ie  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities  and identifiable intangibles  as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination at the impairment test date 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
according to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in the identification of reporting units and in valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  management has determined that the company has one reporting unit 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of january   and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value 
accordingly  as of the annual impairment test date  there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
the company also performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of january   and found no indication of goodwill impairment 
historically  the company has used the quoted market price of our common stock on the impairment test date as the basis for determining fair value 
as of january   the quoted market price of our common stock was per share  resulting in a market capitalization of billion  as compared to a book value common stockholders equity of billion 
accordingly  management expanded the valuation methodology to also incorporate a discounted cash flow analysis dcfa 
the dcfa utilized observable market data to the full extent available 
the discount rates utilized in the dcfa reflected market based estimates of capital costs and discount rates adjusted for management s assessment of a market participant s view with respect to execution  concentration  and other risks associated with the projected cash flows 
the results of the dcfa yielded a fair value of our reporting unit that exceeded its book value 
in addition to the dcfa  the company considered the average market price of its common stock for the one month period subsequent to december   and found that the average market price resulted in a market capitalization greater than the company s book value 
furthermore  management utilized a market premium approach to determine if there was any indication of goodwill impairment 
this approach considers the market value of the company s common stock  and estimates the fair value of the company based on the market value of the stock plus a control premium  and compares that value to the carrying amount of the company s stockholders equity 
in determining the appropriate control premium  management took several factors into consideration  among which were certain facts and circumstances unique to the company  as well as recent trends in market capitalization and control premiums of comparable transactions 

table of contents income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based on the amount we expect to owe the various taxing authorities ie  federal  state  and local 
income taxes represent the net estimated amount due to  or to be received from  such taxing authorities 
in estimating income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions  taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
in this process  management also relies on tax opinions  recent audits  and historical experience 
although we use the best available information to record income taxes  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws and judicial guidance influencing our overall or transaction specific tax position 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and the carryforward of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable  based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made 
subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation allowances recorded in a business combination would be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
balance sheet summary driven by a billion  or  increase in loans outstanding  total assets rose billion  or  year over year to billion at december  in addition to the increase in loans a result of organic loan production the growth of our assets reflects a million increase in securities 
liabilities rose billion year over year  to billion  as deposits increased by billion to billion and borrowed funds increased by million to billion at december  stockholders equity rose million year over year  to billion  and represented of total assets at december  excluding goodwill and core deposit intangibles  net  from the calculation  our tangible stockholders equity rose million year over year to billion  representing of tangible assets at that date

loans in  we capitalized on a decline in competition to increase our loan production and to widen the spreads on our multi family and cre loans 
while competition began to decline in the previous year  at the start of the subprime crisis  the dramatic changes that followed in the credit and capital markets provided us with an opportunity to grow our loan portfolio 
loan originations totaled billion during the year  and were up billion  or  from the year earlier amount 
as a result  the loan portfolio grew billion  or  year over year  to billion  representing of total assets  at december  loan growth was supported by a decline in repayments  as the volatility in the financial markets discouraged refinancing activity 
repayments totaled billion in  representing a billion reduction from the level recorded in the prior year 

table of contents loan origination analysis the following table summarizes our loan production for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  dollars in thousands amount percent of total amount percent of total mortgage loan originations multi family commercial real estate acquisition  development  and construction family total mortgage loan originations other loan originations total loan originations includes c i loan originations of billion and billion in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
multi family loans consistent with our emphasis on multi family lending  multi family loans represented billion  or  of total loans at december  and were up billion  or  from the balance recorded at the prior year end 
multi family loans accounted for billion  or  of our loan production  exceeding the year earlier volume by million  or 
at december   the average multi family loan had a balance of million and the portfolio had an average loan to value ltv ratio of 
the increase in production was supported by the dramatic changes in our market 
while the departure of the conduit lenders brought a return to more rational pricing and production levels in the second half of  the exit of other major competitors and the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac enabled us to significantly step up our lending  and to price our loans at substantially wider spreads  in multi family loans are typically made to long term owners of buildings with apartments that are subject to certain rent control and stabilization laws 
the funds we lend are typically used by the borrowers to make improvements to the buildings and the apartments within them 
upon completion of the improvements  the property owners have the right to increase the rents paid by the tenants and  in doing so  create more cash flows to borrow against in future years 
in addition to underwriting a multi family loan on the basis of the building s income and condition  we consider the borrower s credit history  profitability  and building management expertise 
borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the building s current rent rolls  their financial statements  and related documents 
our multi family loans typically feature a term of ten years  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan  and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten 
the rate charged in the first five years is generally based on the five year constant maturity treasury rate the five year cmt plus a spread 
during years six through ten  the borrower has the option of selecting an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest  as reported in the new york times  plus a spread  or a fixed rate that is tied to the five year cmt  plus a spread 
for new originations  the fixed rate is now tied to the fixed advance rate of the federal home loan bank of new york the fhlb ny plus a spread 
the fixed rate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the then outstanding loan balance 
the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five year term 
as the rent roll increases  the typical property owner seeks to refinance the mortgage  and generally does so before the loan reprices in year six 
while this cycle has repeated itself over the course of many decades  regardless of market interest rates and conditions  refinancing activity was constrained throughout as economic uncertainty increased  and may continue to be restrained while such uncertainty remains 
reflecting our current portfolio  the expected weighted average life of the multi family loan portfolio was years at december  
table of contents multi family loans that refinance within the first five years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule 
depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment  the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the then current loan balance 
our emphasis on multi family loans is driven by several factors  including their structure  which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree 
another factor driving our focus on multi family lending has been the quality of the loans in our specific niche 
we primarily underwrite our multi family loans based on the current cash flows produced by the building  with a reliance on the income method of appraising the properties  rather than the sales approach 
the sales approach is subject to fluctuations in the real estate market  as well as general economic conditions  and is therefore liable to be more risky in the event of a downward credit cycle turn 
we also consider a variety of other factors  including the physical condition of the underlying property  the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio  which is the ratio of the property s net operating income to its debt service  and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the property 
the multi family loans we are originating today generally represent no more than of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property  and typically feature an amortization period of up to years 
in addition to requiring a minimum debt service coverage ratio of on multi family buildings  we require a security interest in the personal property at the premises  and an assignment of rents and leases 
while our multi family lending niche has not been immune to the impact of the widespread economic weakness  we believe that the multi family loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans 
in general  buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable  with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time 
because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition  we believe that they are reasonably likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times 
nonetheless  the continued weakening of the economy in new york city could result in an increase in non performing multi family loans 
our success in this particular niche also reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the market s leading mortgage brokers  who are familiar with our lending practices  our underwriting standards  and our long standing practice of basing our loans on the cash flows produced by the properties 
because the multi family market is largely broker driven  the process of producing such loans is significantly expedited  with loans taking four to six weeks to process  and the related expenses substantially reduced 
at december   billion  or  of our multi family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings  with the remainder of the portfolio being secured by underlying mortgages on cooperative apartment buildings 
in addition  of our multi family loans were secured by buildings in new york city  with manhattan accounting for the largest share 
outside new york city  the state of new york was home to of our multi family credits  with new jersey and pennsylvania accounting for and  respectively 
the remaining of multi family loans were secured by buildings outside our primary market  many of which are owned by borrowers we have made loans to successfully within our local marketplace 
commercial real estate cre loans loan growth was also fueled by an increase in cre lending  as originations rose to billion in from million in the prior year 
cre loans represented billion  or  of total loans at the end of december  up million  or  from the year earlier amount 
at december   the average cre loan had a principal balance of million and the portfolio had an average ltv ratio of 
at december   of our cre loans were secured by properties in new york city  with properties on long island and in new jersey accounting for and  respectively 
the cre loans we produce are secured by income producing properties such as office buildings  retail centers  mixed use buildings  and multi tenanted light industrial properties 
the pricing of our cre loans is structured along the same lines as our multi family credits  ie  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan that is generally tied to the five year cmt  plus a spread 
for years six through ten  the borrower generally has the option of selecting an annually adjustable rate that is based on the 
table of contents prime rate of interest  or a fixed rate that is tied to the five year cmt  plus a spread 
for new cre loan originations  the fixed rate is now tied to the fixed advance rate of the fhlb ny  plus a spread 
the fixed rate option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the then outstanding loan amount 
the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate featured in the initial five year term 
prepayment penalties also apply  with five percentage points of the then current balance generally being charged on loans that refinance in the first year  scaling down to one percentage point of the then current balance on loans that refinance in year five 
our cre loans tend to refinance within five years of origination 
accordingly  the expected weighted average life of the portfolio was years at december  the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties 
to minimize our credit risk  we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards  and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property s current income stream and debt service coverage ratio 
the approval of a loan also depends on the borrower s credit history  profitability  and expertise in property management  and generally requires a debt service coverage ratio of and a maximum ltv ratio of 
in addition  the origination of cre loans typically requires a security interest in the personal property of the borrower and or an assignment of the rents and or leases 
acquisition  development  and construction adc loans while the growth of our loan portfolio was fueled by multi family and cre lending  the increases in these portfolios were tempered by a reduction in adc loans 
as real estate values declined and the number of single family homes for sale increased  we generally limited our adc loan originations to advances that were committed prior to the onset of the credit cycle turn 
as a result  originations declined by million  or  from the year earlier volume to million in adc loans represented million  or  of total loans at december   representing a reduction from billion  or of total loans  at the prior year end 
at december   of the loans in the portfolio were for properties in new york city  with manhattan accounting for more than half of new york city s share 
long island accounted for of our adc loans  with other parts of new york state and new jersey accounting for  combined 
limited adc lending is done outside our immediate market and  even then  to borrowers we have lent to successfully within our marketplace 
the projects we have financed have primarily been for land acquisition  development  and construction of multi family and residential tract projects  and  to a lesser extent  for the construction of owner occupied one to four family homes and commercial properties 
such loans are typically originated for terms of to months  and feature a floating rate of interest tied to prime  and a floor 
they also generate origination fees that are recorded as interest income and amortized over the life of the loan 
because adc loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk  borrowers are required to provide a personal guarantee of repayment and completion during construction 
the risk of loss on an adc loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value upon completion of construction  as compared to the estimated cost of construction  including interest  and the estimated time to sell or lease such property 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  or the length of time to sell or lease the property is greater than anticipated  the property could have a value upon completion that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the loan 
when applicable  it has been our practice to require that residential properties be pre sold or that borrowers secure permanent financing commitments from a recognized lender for an amount equal to  or greater than  the amount of our loan 
in some cases  we ourselves may provide permanent financing 
we typically have required pre leasing for adc loans on commercial properties 
one to four family loans one to four family loans represented million  or  of total loans outstanding at december   as compared to million  representing  at the prior year end 
the decrease reflects repayments and the first quarter securitization of one to four family loans totaling million that had been acquired in our transaction with synergy financial group  inc synergy in october none of the one to four family loans in our portfolio are subprime or alt a loans 

table of contents we originate one to four family loans on a pass through basis  and sell the loans servicing released and without recourse  to a third party conduit shortly after the loans are closed 
each loan that we originate through the conduit program generates fees that are recorded as other non interest income in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
in connection with this practice  which was adopted on december   we participate in a private label program with a nationally recognized third party mortgage originator the conduit  based on defined underwriting criteria 
the loans are marketed through our branch network  as well as on our web site 
in addition  dedicated loan representatives are available to meet with our customers and assist them with the application process 
in addition to ensuring that our customers are provided with an extensive range of one to four family products  the conduit arrangement supports two of our primary objectives managing our exposure to interest rate risk and maintaining our efficiency 
other loans notwithstanding a million rise in originations to billion  other loans represented million  or  of total loans at december   as compared to million  or of total loans  at the prior year end 
c i loans accounted for million and million of other loans at december  and  respectively  and for billion and billion of loans produced in the corresponding years 
c i loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers  and include term loans  demand loans  revolving lines of credit  letters of credit  and loans that are partly guaranteed by the small business administration 
a broad range of c i loans  both collateralized and unsecured  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable  business expansion  the purchase of machinery and equipment  and other general corporate needs 
in determining the tenor and structure of a c i loan  several factors are considered  including its purpose  the collateral  and the anticipated sources of repayment 
c i loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower  and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower s financial stability 
the interest rates on c i loans can be fixed or floating  with floating rate loans being tied to prime or some other market index  plus an applicable spread 
given the changes in interest rates in recent quarters  our floating rate loans are increasingly featuring a floor rate of interest as well 
a benefit of c i lending is the opportunity to establish full scale banking relationships with our c i customers 
as a result  many of our borrowers are now providing us with deposits  and many are taking advantage of our cash management  investment  and trade finance services 
the remainder of the portfolio of other loans consists primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit  as well as a variety of consumer loans  most of which were originated by our merger partners prior to their joining the company 
we currently do not offer home equity loans or lines of credit

table of contents lending authority the loans we originate are subject to federal and state laws and regulations  and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies and procedures approved by the mortgage and real estate committee of the board of directors of the community bank the mortgage committee  the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank the credit committee  and the respective boards of directors as a whole 
in addition to the loans that we ourselves have originated  the portfolio includes loans that were acquired in our various business combinations 
in accordance with the banks policies  all loans of million or more must be reported to the respective boards of directors 
in  of such loans were originated by the banks  with an aggregate loan balance of billion at origination 
in the prior year  of such loans were originated by the banks with an aggregate loan balance at origination of billion 
in addition  we place a limit on the amount of loans that may be made to one borrower 
at december   the largest concentration of loans to one borrower consisted of a million multi family loan provided by the community bank to riverbay corporation co op city  a residential community with  units in the bronx  new york  which was created under new york state s mitchell lama housing program in the late s to provide affordable housing for middle income residents of the state

table of contents outstanding loan commitments at december   we had outstanding loan commitments of billion  including commitments to originate million of multi family loans  million of cre loans  million of adc loans  and million of other loans  including million of unadvanced lines of credit 
commitments to originate one to four family loans totaled million at december  in addition to these loan commitments  we had commitments to issue financial stand by  performance  and commercial letters of credit of million  million  and million  respectively  at year end 
the commitments featured terms ranging from one to three years 
financial stand by letters of credit obligate us to guarantee payment of a specific financial obligation on behalf of certain borrowers  while performance stand by letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under certain non financial contractual obligations 
commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer 
although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions  the majority are used to settle payments in international trade 
typically  such letters of credit require presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction  and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title 
the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
please see contractual obligations and off balance sheet commitments later in this report for a further discussion of financial stand by  performance  and commercial letters of credit 
asset quality the credit cycle turn that began with the subprime crisis in evolved into a broad based economic decline in while we experienced an increase in net charge offs and non performing loans  the degree to which we were impacted by the mounting economic crisis was modest by comparison with many of our peers 
net charge offs rose to million in from  in  and represented and of average loans  at the respective dates 
while the net charge offs we recorded in the prior year consisted of c i and consumer loans  our net charge offs consisted primarily of c i  consumer  and adc loans 
non performing loans totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and  and represented and of total loans at the corresponding dates 
the increase in non performing loans was attributable to an million rise in non accrual mortgage loans to million and a million rise in non accrual other loans to million  year over year 
the increase in non accrual mortgage loans was also broad based in nature  without any specific loan type dominating the mix 
a loan generally is classified as a non accrual loan when it is days past due 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  we cease the accrual of interest owed  and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income 
a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is less than days past due and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible 
non performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and reported on a monthly basis to the mortgage committee  the credit committee  and the boards of directors of the banks 
when necessary  non performing loans are written down to their current appraised values  less certain transaction costs 
outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans 
properties that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as other real estate owned  and recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition  less the estimated cost of selling the property 
at december   other real estate owned consisted of three properties totaling million  as compared to five properties totaling  at the prior year end 
other real estate owned is typically titled in the name of a wholly owned bank subsidiary 

table of contents it is our policy to require an appraisal of properties classified as other real estate owned shortly before foreclosure and to re appraise the properties on an as needed basis until they are sold 
we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible  given current market conditions and the property s condition  and are in the process of marketing the properties that comprised our other real estate owned at year end 
reflecting the levels of non performing loans and other real estate owned recorded  non performing assets rose million year over year to million  representing of total assets at december  to mitigate the potential for credit risk  we underwrite our loans in accordance with prudent credit standards 
in the case of multi family and cre loans  we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated to determine the property s economic value  and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan 
the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values  with the economic value more typically being used 
the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor 
multi family buildings and cre properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval by management and the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
in addition  a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on multi family loans originated in excess of million 
similarly  a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on cre loans in excess of million 
furthermore  independent appraisers  whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in house appraisal officers  perform appraisals on collateral properties 
in addition  we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers typically exceeds ten years 
to further manage our credit risk  our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower and typically require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of  except for cre loans  which generally require a minimum ratio of 
although we typically will lend up to of the appraised value on multi family buildings and up to on commercial properties  the average ltv ratios of such credits were below those amounts at december  exceptions to these ltv limitations are reviewed on a case by case basis  requiring the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
the boards of directors also take part in the adc lending process  with all adc loans requiring the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
in addition  a member of the pertinent committee participates in inspections when the loan amount exceeds million 
we believe that the adc loans in our portfolio have been prudently underwritten 
in addition  they primarily have been made to well established builders who have worked with us or our merger partners in the past 
we typically lend up to of the estimated as completed market value of multi family and residential tract projects  however  in the case of home construction loans to individuals  the limit is 
with respect to commercial construction loans  which are not our primary focus  we typically lend up to of the estimated as completed market value of the property 
credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process 
loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses  and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and or consulting engineers 
c i loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower s business  and are generally collateralized by various business assets  including  but not limited to  inventory  equipment  and accounts receivable 
as a result  the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful 
furthermore  the collateral underlying the loan may depreciate over time  may not be conducive to appraisal  and may fluctuate in value  based upon the business results 
accordingly  personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for c i loans 
our loan portfolio has been deliberately structured to manage our exposure to both credit and interest rate risk 
the vast majority of the loans in our portfolio are intermediate term credits  with multi family and cre loans typically repaying or refinancing within three to five years of origination  and the duration of adc loans ranging up to months  with to months more the norm 
furthermore  our multi family loans are largely secured by buildings with rent regulated apartments that tend to maintain a high level of occupancy  regardless of economic conditions in our marketplace 

table of contents the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories  with late charges assessed  and notices mailed to the borrower  at specified dates 
we attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment 
when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property  we attempt to obtain full payment  and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action 
while we strive to originate loans that will perform fully  the magnitude of the current economic crisis has resulted in an increase in non performing loans and assets to levels that exceed our traditional amounts 
in addition  the level of net charge offs has increased 
in view of the declining economy and the increase in non performing assets and net charge offs  we increased our allowance for loan losses by recording a loan loss provision of million in no provision for loan losses was recorded in the prior year 
reflecting the provision and the aforementioned net charge offs  our loan loss allowance rose from million at december  to million at december  the latter amount was equivalent to of non performing loans and of total loans at the same date 
the manner in which the allowance for loan losses is established  and the assumptions made in that process  are considered critical to our financial condition and results 
such assumptions are based on judgments that are difficult  complex  and subjective regarding various matters of inherent uncertainty 
the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these judgments 
accordingly  the policies that govern our assessment of the allowance for loan losses are considered critical accounting policies and are discussed under that heading earlier in this report 
based upon all relevant and available information  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate at that date

in addition  it should be noted that the portion of the loan loss allowance allocated to each loan category does not represent the total amount available to absorb losses that may occur within that category  since the total loan loss allowance is available for the entire loan portfolio 

table of contents securities securities represented billion  or  of total assets at december   as compared to billion  or  of total assets at december  the investment policies of the company and the banks are established by the respective boards of directors and implemented by their respective investment committees  in concert with the respective asset and liability management committees 
the investment committees generally meet quarterly or on an as needed basis to review the portfolios and specific capital market transactions 
in addition  the securities portfolios are reviewed monthly by the boards of directors as a whole 
furthermore  the policies guiding the company s and the banks investments are reviewed at least annually by the respective investment committees  as well as by the respective boards 
while the policies permit investment in various types of liquid assets  neither the company nor the banks currently maintain a trading portfolio 
our general investment strategy is to purchase liquid investments with various maturities to ensure that our overall interest rate risk position stays within the required limits of our investment policies 
in view of the volatility in the capital markets in  we largely limited our investments during the year to government sponsored enterprise gse obligations defined as gse certificates  gse collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and gse debentures  all of which are backed by the us government 
at december   of our securities portfolio consisted of gse obligations 
the remainder of the portfolio was comprised of triple a rated private label cmos  corporate bonds  trust preferred securities  corporate equities  and municipal obligations 
we have no investments that are backed by subprime or alt a loans 
depending on management s intent at the time of purchase  securities are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
while available for sale securities are intended to generate earnings  they also represent a significant source of cash flows and liquidity for future loan production  the reduction of higher cost funding  and general operating activities 
these cash flows stem from the repayment of principal and interest  in addition to the sale of such securities 
held to maturity securities also generate cash flows from repayments and serve as a source of earnings 
securities expected to be held for an indefinite period of time are classified as available for sale 
a decision to purchase or sell these securities is based on economic conditions  including changes in interest rates  liquidity  and our asset and liability management strategy 
available for sale securities represented billion  or  of total securities at december   as compared to billion  representing of total securities  at the prior year end 
included in the respective year end amounts were mortgage related securities of million and million  and other securities of million and million 
the estimated weighted average life of the available for sale securities portfolio was years at december  and years at december  reflecting the significant decline in market conditions  the after tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale rose to million at december  from million at december  the respective after tax losses were recorded as a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated statements of condition at the corresponding dates 
held to maturity securities represented billion  or  of total securities at december   signifying a increase from billion at the prior year end 
at december   the fair value of securities held to maturity represented of their carrying value 
mortgage related securities accounted for billion and billion  respectively  of the year end and totals  with other securities representing the remaining billion and billion  respectively 
included in the respective year end amounts were gse obligations of billion and billion  capital trust notes of million and million  and corporate bonds of million and million 
the estimated weighted average lives of the held to maturity securities portfolio were years and years at the corresponding dates 
as a result of the unprecedented volatility that has gripped the capital markets  we recorded total otti charges of million on certain of our securities in included in these charges were million on our investments in lehman brothers and million on our investment in freddie mac 
in  we recorded an otti charge of million in connection with the repositioning of our balance sheet following our acquisition of pennfed financial services  inc pennfed in april of that year 

table of contents in the process of determining if and when a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we consider  among other factors  the length of time and extent of the unrealized loss  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until the earlier of its anticipated recovery or maturity 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resultant loss is charged against earnings
