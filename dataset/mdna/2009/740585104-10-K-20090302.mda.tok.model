our primary corporate objectives in are focused on continuing to enhance our customer value and to differentiate our products and our company from our competitors 
we believe our success toward these initiatives will enhance the positive momentum we have generated in our business 
specifically  in  our strategic plan includes our continued focus on developing and launching innovative products and customer self service tools that improve our user experience  crafting pricing strategies aimed at enhancing the overall quality and consistency of our revenues  and building a brand that is a sustainable asset for us 
in the fourth quarter of  nearly of our consolidated net revenues were denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
because we generate a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues from our international operations  movements in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results 
we estimate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the fourth quarter of negatively impacted our consolidated net revenues by approximately million as compared to the fourth quarter of we anticipate movements in foreign currency exchange rates will continue to negatively impact our financial results for the remainder of we have experienced revenue growth in our pgimeet solutions through increases in minutes of use  offset in part by declines in average selling prices per minute for this solution 
traditional pricing for these services is on a per minute basis 
during  we introduced pricing on a subscription based pricing model similar to that of other on demand service providers 
revenues from subscription based pricing have been less than of total revenues for our pgimeet solutions 
revenues from our pgimeet solutions in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we have experienced revenue volume declines in our broadcast fax delivery and fax delivery aspects of our pgisend solutions 
pricing for these services are on a per minute or per page delivered basis 
revenues from these services in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
declines in these fax delivery solutions have been primarily associated with volume declines 
although we have and will continue to convert such customers to other alternative solutions  we expect this overall decline in revenue to continue 
we expect that our continued growth in revenues and operating cash flows will be associated with growth in the remainder of our solutions  including continued volume growth in our audio conferencing pgimeet solutions 
we expect this growth will offset declines in our fax delivery solutions associated with broadcast fax and pgisend 
we have made acquisitions of businesses  particularly conferencing and collaboration providers  which have increased our revenues and operating cash flows 
these acquisitions have been primarily to expand our customer base  distribution channels and geographic presence 
we are able to realize synergies by integrating these acquisitions into our own operating infrastructure 
historically  these acquisitions have generally been accretive to our revenues  operating cash flows and earnings per share 
during  we acquired approximately of our outstanding shares pursuant to our self tender offer and in the open market which was the primary cause of net borrowings of million of our credit facility 
we purchased these shares under the self tender offer at a premium of approximately  or a share 
at march   prior to our self tender offer  borrowings under our credit facility were million 
at june   after completing the self tender offer  borrowings under our credit facility were million 
since june   we have used our cash flows from operations less capital expenditures  or free cash flow  for debt repayments  acquisitions and stock repurchases 
at december   borrowings under our credit facility were million 
during  and  our free cash flow was million  million and million  respectively see non gaap financial measures 
based on our historical free cash flow  we anticipate amending to extend the tenure or refinancing our existing credit facility prior to maturity 
in  we anticipate continuing to use our free cash flow to pay down our debt  while still continuing to be optimistic in possible acquisitions and share repurchases 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from the estimates

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we have utilized approximately million of our credit facility  with approximately million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding 
in december  we increased our line of credit to million  and  in january  we further increased our line of credit to million  all under an accordion feature 
from time to time  we enter into interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates on interest payments associated with our credit facility 
as of december   we have two million interest rate swaps  one of which is for a two year period beginning in august at a fixed rate of approximately and one of which is for a three year period beginning in august with a fixed rate of approximately 
at the maturity of our credit facility in april or in the event of an acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facility following an event of default  the entire outstanding principal amount of the indebtedness under the facility  together with all other amounts payable thereunder from time to time  will become due and payable 
it is possible that we may not have sufficient funds to pay such obligations in full at maturity or upon such acceleration 
if we default and are not able to pay any such obligations due  our lenders have liens on substantially all of our assets and could foreclose on our assets in order to satisfy our obligations

therefore  we record foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from these transactions in other  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
we generally consider intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries to be permanently invested for the foreseeable future 
therefore  we record foreign currency exchange fluctuations resulting from these transactions in the cumulative translation adjustment account on the face of our consolidated balance sheets 
based on our potential cash position and potential conditions in the capital markets  we could require repayment of these loans despite the long term intention to hold them as permanent investments 
at december   we had approximately million of availability under our existing million credit facility  without regard to the uncommitted million of the accordion feature 
for a discussion of our credit facility  see capital resources 
cash provided by operating activities consolidated operating cash flows were million  million and million in  and  respectively

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin no 
 that is expected to be settled during the remaining amount that has been accrued in accordance with fin is not included in the contractual obligations table because we are unable to determine when  or if  payment of these amounts will be made 
state sales tax and excise taxes we have reserves for certain state sales and excise tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation in accordance with sfas no 
historically  we have collected and remitted state sales tax from our non pgimeet solutions customers in applicable states  but have not collected and remitted state sales tax from our pgimeet solutions customers in all applicable jurisdictions 
in addition  we have learned that certain of our pgimeet solutions may be subject to telecommunications excise tax statutes in certain states 
during the years ended december  and  we paid million and million related to the settlement of certain of these state sales and excise tax contingencies 
at december  and december   we had reserved approximately million and million  respectively  for certain state sales and excise tax contingencies 
these amounts are included in accrued taxes  other than income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies 
in the event that actual results differ from these reserves  we may need to make adjustments  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  states may disagree with our method of assessing and remitting such taxes or additional states may subject us to inquiries regarding such taxes 
capital resources we have a million committed revolving credit facility  which consists of an original revolving credit facility of million with a million accordion feature  of which million has been exercised to date 
this accordion feature allows for additional credit commitments to increase the revolving credit facility up to a maximum of million  subject to its terms and conditions 
our credit facility matures in april in january  we expanded the committed amounts under the accordion feature of our credit facility by million from million to million 
we paid less than million in financing costs for this expansion of our credit facility 
we have not had any expansions of our credit facility subsequent to the january expansion 
certain of our material domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility  which is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our material domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  we have pledged as collateral all of the issued and outstanding stock of our material domestic subsidiaries and of our material foreign subsidiaries 
in april  we entered into an amendment to our credit facility  which inserted into the applicable margin pricing grid a new tier based on a total leverage ratio of times or greater  increased the permitted covenant level of the consolidated total leverage ratio and amended certain other provisions to allow us to purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire up to an additional million of our common stock during  of which we used approximately million to fund our self tender offer in the second quarter of at december   we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants under our credit facility 
proceeds drawn under our credit facility may be used for refinancing of existing debt  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and other general corporate purposes 
the annual interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility  at our option  is the base rate the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the bank of america prime rate or libor  plus  in each case  an applicable margin that varies based upon our leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter 
at december   our applicable margin with respect to base rate loans was  and the applicable margin with respect to libor loans was 
at december   our interest rate on day us dollar libor loans was for our borrowings on which we did not have an interest rate swap agreement in place 
at december   our interest rate on day euro and canadian dollar libor loans was and  respectively 
at december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding and approximately million in letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility 
included in our outstanding borrowings at december  was ca million canadian dollars and million euros 
in february  we entered into a three year million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of  and in august  we entered into two separate three year million interest rate swaps at and  respectively 
we did not designate these interest rate swaps as hedges 
during the second quarter of  we terminated these interest rate swaps and recorded a gain of approximately million in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
monthly settlements with the bank resulted in a gain of million for the year ended december  and are recognized in earnings as interest expense 
in august  we entered into two million two year interest rate swaps at a fixed rate of approximately 
in december  we amended the life of one of the million swaps to three years and reduced the fixed rate to approximately 
we did not initially designate these interest rate swaps as hedges and  as such  we did not account for them under hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of we prospectively designated these interest rate swaps as hedges using the long haul method of effectiveness testing 
any changes in fair value prior to designation as a hedge and any ineffectiveness subsequent to such designation are recognized as unrealized loss on change in fair value of interest rate swaps as a component of other expense income in our consolidated statements of operations and amounted to million and million during the months ended december  and  respectively 
on october   our japanese subsidiary  xpedite japan  entered into a yen denominated day term loan facility that expires annually on september for million with sumitomo mitsui banking 
xpedite japan has subsequently renewed this term loan through october  the interest rate on outstanding borrowings during varied between and  and borrowings during varied between million and million 
during  xpedite japan cancelled this facility with no outstanding borrowings at december  we have entered into various capital leases for the purchase of operating equipment 
these capital leases have interest rates ranging from to and terms ranging from months to months 
the capital lease obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheets for these leases was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
liquidity as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
we generated positive operating cash flows from each of our geographic business segments for the months ended december  each geographic business segment had sufficient cash flows from operations to service existing debt obligations  to fund capital expenditure requirements  which have historically been to of annual consolidated net revenues  and to fund research and development costs for new services and enhancements to existing services  which have historically been approximately to of annual consolidated net revenues 
assuming no material change to these costs  which we do not anticipate  we believe that we will generate adequate operating cash flows for capital expenditures and contractual commitments and to satisfy our indebtedness and fund our liquidity needs for at least the next months 
at december   we had million of available credit on our existing million credit facility  without regard to the uncommitted million of the accordion feature 
during  we acquired approximately of our outstanding shares pursuant to our self tender offer and in the open market which was the primary cause of net borrowings of million of our credit facility 
we purchased these shares under the self tender offer at a premium of approximately  or a share 
at march   prior to our self tender offer  borrowings under our credit facility were million 
at june   after completing the self tender offer  borrowings under our credit facility were million 
since june   we have used our cash flows from operations less capital expenditures  or free cash flow  for debt repayments  acquisitions and stock repurchases 
at december   borrowings under our credit facility were million 
during  and  our free cash flow was million  million and million  respectively see non gaap financial measures 
based on our historical free cash flow  we anticipate amending to extend the tenure or refinancing our existing credit facility prior to maturity 
in  we anticipate continuing to use our free cash flow to pay down our debt  while still continuing to be optimistic in possible acquisitions and share repurchases 
we regularly review our capital structure and evaluate potential alternatives in light of current conditions in the capital markets 
depending upon conditions in these markets  cash flows from our operating segments and other factors  we may engage in other capital transactions 
these capital transactions include but are not limited to debt or equity issuances or credit facilities with banking institutions 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  legal contingencies and derivative instruments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues consist primarily of usage fees generally based on per minute  per fax page or per transaction methods 
to a lesser extent  we charge subscription fees and have fixed period minimum revenue commitments 
unbilled revenue consists of earned but unbilled revenue that results from non calendar month billing cycles and the one month lag time in billing related to certain of our services 
deferred revenue consists of payments made by customers in advance of the time services are rendered 
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin  or sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a  b and sab should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable prior to the recognition of revenue  we make a decision that collectability is reasonably assured 
over time  management analyzes accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms and trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable in any accounting period 
the accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment to their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate intangible assets and long lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in physical condition or manner of use of an asset  significant adverse change in legal factors or negative industry or economic trends  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and an expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in  sfas no 
became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we completed reviews as of january   and and immediately prior to the change in our segment reporting in the fourth quarter of with no impairments identified 
other intangible assets with finite lives that do not meet the criteria of sfas no 
continue to be amortized 
we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets and the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
the impairment loss  if applicable  is calculated based on the discounted estimated future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital compared to the carrying value of the long lived asset 
we impaired customer lists and developed technology that was determined to have no value to the company and recorded an asset impairment equal to the net book value of million 
net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
future events could cause us to conclude that the current estimates used should be changed and that goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves significant management judgement in estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
income tax expense  income taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined and recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
 and fin our net deferred tax liability as of december  was million and our net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
our deferred tax asset changed to a deferred tax liability as the result of an automatic change in accounting method for tax purposes utilized on our income tax return accelerating the deduction for internally developed software 
we have recorded our valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reverse an existing valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december  determined in accordance with fin was million 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit that  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective tax rate was million at december  we also have reserves for certain asserted international  federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to inquiries from us and non us tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated income taxes to be paid in future periods 
we believe we have appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
if we are required to pay an amount less than or exceeding our provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust tax accounts which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
restructuring costs restructuring reserves are based on certain estimates and judgments related to severance and exit costs  contractual obligations and related costs 
our estimated severance costs could be impacted if actual severance payments to individuals outside of the united states are less than initial estimates 
contractual lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to secure sublessees  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to establish additional restructuring accruals or reverse accrual amounts accordingly 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as disclosed in item legal proceedings of this annual report 
in accordance with sfas  no 
 we accrue an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of legal claims 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
our estimates are subject to change  and we adjust the financial impact in the period in which they are resolved 
derivative instruments we have entered into interest rate swaps that are classified as derivatives consistent with sfas no 
with the intention of hedging the cash flow risk of variable day libor interest rate changes on the interest payments associated with our credit facility 
we did not initially designate these interest rate swaps as hedges and  as such  we did not account for them under hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of  we prospectively designated these interest rate swaps as hedges using the long haul method of effectiveness testing 
the principal objective of these swaps is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with our variable rate debt 
any changes in fair value prior to designation as a hedge and any ineffectiveness subsequent to such designation are recognized as unrealized loss on change in fair value of interest rate swaps as a component of other expense income in our consolidated statements of operations throughout the contract periods 
any changes in fair value that are determined to be effective are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of derivatives is recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as accrued expenses under current liabilities or long term liabilities depending on the maturity date of the contract

in addition  in august  we entered into two million two year interest rate swaps at a fixed rate of approximately 
on december   we amended one of the million swaps to reduce the rate to a fixed rate of and extend the maturity to august  these interest rate swaps effectively convert the interest payments of million of our libor based borrowings to a fixed rate 
at december   we had borrowings of approximately million outstanding under our line of credit that are subject to interest rate risk
