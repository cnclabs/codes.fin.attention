item business company overview american public education  inc is a provider of exclusively online postsecondary education directed at the needs of the military and public service communities 
we operate through two universities  american military university  or amu  and american public university  or apu  which together constitute the american public university system 
our universities share a common faculty and curriculum  which includes degree programs and certificate programs in disciplines related to national security  military studies  intelligence  homeland security  criminal justice  technology  business administration  education and liberal arts 
we currently serve over  students living in all states and more than foreign countries 
our university system is regionally and nationally accredited 
from to  our total revenue increased from million to million  which represents a compound annual growth rate cagr of 
our net course registrations increased and in and  respectively  over the prior periods 
we believe our growth is attributable to i high student satisfaction and referral rates  ii regional accreditation in may  iii increasing acceptance of distance learning within our targeted markets  and iv achieving certification to participate in federal student aid programs under title iv of the higher education act of beginning with classes starting in november as our revenue base grows  we expect our growth rate percentages to decline 
however  we expect actual dollar revenue growth to increase 
net income improved to million in from net income of in over of our students serve in the united states military on active duty  in the reserves  or in the national guard or are veterans 
most of our other students are public service professionals including federal  national and local law enforcement personnel or other first responders 
our programs are designed to help these working adult students advance in their current professions or prepare for their next career 
our online method of instruction is well suited to these students  many of whom serve in positions requiring extended and irregular schedules  are on call for rapid response missions  participate in extended deployments and exercises  travel or relocate frequently and have limited financial resources 
our satisfied students have been a significant source of referrals for us  reducing our marketing costs per new student 
over of our new students in who responded to our surveys tell us they inquired about enrolling in either amu or apu as the result of a personal referral 
as of december   we had approximately full time and over adjunct faculty  virtually all of whom have advanced degrees and many of whom are former or current leading practitioners in their fields 
our adjunct faculty also includes professors who teach at leading national and state universities 
we believe quality faculty members are attracted to us because of the high percentage of military and public service professionals in our student body who can immediately apply lessons learned in our classroom to their daily work 
in addition  our faculty members are attracted to the flexible nature of teaching online  the numerous support services we provide them  and our per student pay structure for adjunct faculty 
our faculty is organized into several departments under the leadership of a provost who reports to our president and under the supervision of a nine member university board of trustees 
we have invested significant amounts of capital and resources on developing proprietary information systems and processes to support what we refer to as partnership at a distance  or pad 
pad is our approach to how we interact with our students  and at its center is the pad system 
the pad system allows prospective and current students to interact with us exclusively online  on their schedule 
the pad system also allows us to manage on an automated and cost effective basis the complex administrative tasks resulting from offering monthly starts for over  classes in over unique courses to our over  students taught by over faculty members 
our systems and processes also help us measure and manage the activities of our faculty  student support personnel  and prospective and active students  allowing us to continuously improve our academic quality  student support services and marketing efficiency 
we believe these proprietary systems and processes will support a much larger institution and provide us important competitive and cost advantages 
history we were founded as american military university in and began offering courses in january our founder  a retired marine officer  established american military university as a distance learning graduate level institution  specializing in a military studies curriculum for military officers seeking an advanced degree relevant to their profession 
while american military university began as a paper based institution that operated by mail  fax  phone and e mail  we have always been an institution specializing in distributed  distance delivery 
following initial national accreditation by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council  or detc  in  in january american military university began offering undergraduate programs primarily directed to members of the armed forces 
it gradually broadened its military studies curriculum over the next three years to include defense management  civil war studies  intelligence  and unconventional warfare  and later expanded into military related disciplines such as criminal justice  emergency management  national security  and homeland security 
over time  american military university diversified its educational offerings into the liberal arts in response to demand by military students for post military career preparation 
with its expanded program offerings  american military university extended its outreach to the greater public service community  primarily police  fire  emergency management personnel and national security professionals 
in  we reorganized the operations of american military university into our current university system and we began operating through two brands  amu and apu 
the purpose of the reorganization was in part to establish an institution brand  apu  that would appeal to non military markets  including public service professionals such as teachers 
our university system achieved regional accreditation in may with the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools higher learning commission 
in september  we received approval from the higher learning commission to offer seven new degree programs in education and information technology 
since the founding of american military university  we have gradually transitioned from a military focus to a more broad based focus on the military and public services communities 
today  the split between students who are eligible for tuition assistance programs of the department of defense  or dod  and those who are not is approximately two thirds to one third 
we expect the percentage of our students that are not eligible for tuition assistance programs of the dod to continue to increase  particularly as a result of our eligibility to participate in title iv programs and with our new degree offerings in education and information technology 
market overview within the postsecondary education market  we believe that there is significant opportunity for growth in online programs 
we believe that increasing requirements for workers to have job mobility  combined with the growing acceptance of online learning from employers  and the flexibility associated with online learning should attract more students  both traditional and adult  to distance learning 
there are more than million active and reserve military professionals in the united states armed forces 
each year  approximately  new service members are enlisted or commissioned to replace retiring and separating members 
we believe that the unpredictable and demanding work schedules of military personnel and their geographic distribution make online learning and asynchronous teaching particularly attractive to them 
military leaders and policies promote voluntary education programs as a means for service members to gain the knowledge and skills that will improve their military performance as well as prepare them for a career following their military service 
academic achievement can also result in increased rank and pay for service members 
the united states armed forces recognize academic achievement through awarding promotion points for academic credits  specifying education level eligibility requirements for assignments  promotions  and service schools  and entering remarks on performance appraisals 
active duty and reserve component military personnel are eligible for tuition assistance through the uniform tuition assistance program of the dod 
dod policy allows for payment of of a military student s tuition costs  up to per semester credit hour and a maximum benefit of  per fiscal year 
our undergraduate tuition per course is designed so that the tuition assistance paid by the service branches covers the cost of our courses for service members up to the annual maximum benefit 
military students who are eligible for the veterans administration s gi bill entitlement program may apply those funds to pay for tuition costs above the dod limits through the gi bill s top up feature 
most military veterans are also eligible to use their gi bill entitlement in continuing their education after retirement or separation 
we believe that national security  homeland security  and public safety professionals also represent a large and growing market for online education 
as with their military counterparts  these individuals have unique program requirements as well as unpredictable and demanding work schedules that often prevent them from attending traditional universities 
competitive strengths we believe that we have the following competitive strengths exclusively online education we have designed our courses and programs specifically for online delivery  and we recruit and train faculty exclusively for online instruction 
because our students are located around the globe  we focus our instruction on asynchronous  interactive instruction that provides students the flexibility to study and interact during the hours of the day or days of the week that suit their terms and schedules 
emphasis on military and public services communities since our founding  our culture has reflected our devotion to our mission of educating those who serve tm 
we have designed our academic programs  policies  marketing strategies and tuition specifically to meet the needs of the military and public service communities 
affordable tuition our tuition is generally consistent with less expensive in state tuition at state universities and is designed so that dod tuition assistance programs fully cover the cost of undergraduate courses and over of the cost of graduate courses 
we have not increased our undergraduate tuition of per credit hour since and have no current intention to do so 
commitment to academic excellence our academic programs are overseen by our board of trustees  which counts as members two former college presidents  four active accreditation peer evaluators  a former commandant of the marine corps  and a former department of the army inspector general 
we are committed to continuously improving our academic programs and services  as evidenced by the level of attention and resources we apply to instruction and educational support 
proprietary information systems and processes through the pad system  students may access our services online  such as admission  orientation  course registrations  tuition payments  book requests  grades  transcripts and degree progress  and various other inquiries 
we also have created management tools based on the data from the pad system that help us to improve continuously our academic quality  student support services and marketing efficiency 
a key benefit to our proprietary systems and processes is that they allow us to manage the complexities involved in starting over  classes in over unique courses monthly 
we believe our proprietary systems and processes will support a much larger student body and provide us important competitive and cost advantages 
highly scalable and profitable business model we believe our exclusively online education model  our proprietary management information systems  our relatively low student acquisition costs  and our variable faculty cost model have enabled us to expand our operating margins 
growth strategies we believe our growth in student enrollment and revenue has consistently been driven by high student satisfaction and referral rates and increasing acceptance of distance learning within our targeted markets 
between and  we grew our revenue from million to million 
our revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  as our revenue base grows  we expect our growth rate percentages to decline 
however  we expect actual dollar revenue growth to increase 
we plan to grow our business by employing the following primary strategies expand in our core military market we have focused on the needs of the military community since our founding and this community has been responsible for the vast majority of our growth to date 
the combination of our online model  focused curriculum and outreach to the military has enabled us to gain share from more established schools that have served this market for longer periods  many of which are traditional brick and mortar schools 
capitalize on title iv availability to penetrate the public service and civilian markets we believe our curriculum is directly relevant to federal  state and local law enforcement and other first responders  but historically this market was limited to us because  outside the federal government  only a few agencies or departments have the tuition reimbursement plans critical to fund continuing adult education 
now that our students can obtain grants or low cost student loans through title iv programs  we have begun to increase our focus on these markets 
focus on improving student retention as of december   over of the students who have completed three classes with us remain as active students or have graduated from our university system 
however  because our academics are rigorous  and because we are an open enrollment university system  accepting into our undergraduate programs all applicants with a high school diploma or equivalent  many of our new students have difficulty continuing with our program and drop after only one or two courses 
add new degree programs we plan to continue to expand our degree offerings to meet our students needs 
for example  we recently received approval from the higher learning commission and detc to offer new associate degrees and a bachelor of science in criminal justice with concentration in forensics 
accreditation an institution must be licensed before it is allowed to teach students but generally cannot be accredited until it has active students and two years of successful  demonstrated performance 
the accrediting body must observe the institution s processes  policies and procedures  and assess its financial viability  among other factors 
we maintain institutional accreditation with accrediting bodies recognized by the us department of education 
the higher learning commission initially granted us candidacy status in february we received regional accreditation from the higher learning commission in may we submitted a february progress report on undergraduate program reviews and assessment to the higher learning commission  notwithstanding that we were not required to do so because of our participation in the higher learning commission s academy for assessment of student learning 
the higher learning commission has scheduled the next reaccreditation site visit during the academic year 
we received national accreditation with the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council in detc s process provides for a reevaluation and affirmation of our accreditation every five years 
we are slated for a reaccreditation review in late curriculum and scheduling we offer degree and certificate programs 
these programs contain more than  courses  designated as core  major or elective courses 
we offer terms beginning on the first monday of each month  with approximately  classes in over unique courses starting each month in either eight or sixteen week formats 
semesters and academic years are established to manage requirements for participation in title iv programs and to assist students who are utilizing title iv programs in meeting eligibility requirements 
programs number master of arts master of business administration master of education master of public health master of science bachelor of arts bachelor of business administration bachelor of science associate of arts associate of science certificates graduate undergraduate total at the graduate level  we offer degree programs in the following disciplines master of arts in criminal justice emergency management and disaster management history homeland security humanities intelligence studies international relations and conflict resolution management military history military studies national security studies political science public administration security management transportation management and logistics master of business administration master of education in administration and supervision guidance counseling teaching master of public health master of science in environmental policy and management space studies sports management at the undergraduate level  we offer degree programs in the following disciplines bachelor of arts in child and family development criminal justice emergency and disaster management english history homeland security hospitality management intelligence studies international relations management marketing middle eastern studies military history military management and program acquisition philosophy political science psychology religion security management sociology transportation and logistics management bachelor of business administration bachelor of science in criminal justice with concentration in forensics environmental studies fire science management information technology information technology management information system security legal studies public health space studies sports and health sciences associate of arts in accounting business administration communication counter terrorism studies early childhood care and education general studies history hospitality military history personnel administration real estate studies weapons of mass destruction preparedness associate of science in computer applications database application development fire science explosive ordnance disposal web publishing paralegal studies public health our certificate programs generally consist of a minimum of semester hours of required courses focusing on a particular component of the broader degree program 
students may earn discrete certificates or in combination with work toward a degree program 
lead generation and student recruitment we direct our marketing efforts primarily toward building brand awareness and lead generation among professionals serving in the military and public service communities 
we mainly focus on a relationship based strategy by striving to build long term and sustainable relationships with influential people and organizations within these groups 
we believe that persons working in these fields tend to be tightly knit  which we believe greatly facilitates personal testimonials from active and former students to prospective students 
we believe this approach enables us to achieve student acquisition costs that are substantially less than the industry average 
we also utilize internet organic search techniques and key word purchases for more consumer focused marketing efforts 
admissions our universities welcome qualified individuals to apply for admission at any time through an online application process 
we are an open enrollment institution  and qualifications for our undergraduate program are a high school diploma or general education development certificate 
graduate applicants must hold a baccalaureate degree from an accredited us institution or an equivalent foreign institution 
in  more than  prospective students inquired about admission through our website or by mail  e mail  or phone and more than  started at least one course 
in  more than  inquiries were received and more than  students started at least one course 
prospective students apply directly online 
upon completing the online application and orientation  students are issued a student id number and password and provided information for submitting the necessary documentation to finalize their admission and apply for evaluation of credits that they would like to transfer 
students are also informed how to register for their initial course s  arrange for tuition payment and navigate the online student environment 
prospective students who have questions during the admissions process may obtain assistance through our online resources and can contact the admissions department through our online resources or by telephone 
tuition  books and fees we believe that our ability to provide affordable programs is one of our competitive strengths 
we have maintained our tuition costs in line with public  in state rates and within the dod tuition ceilings 
undergraduate tuition is per semester credit hour  or per three credit course 
this is aligned with the dod s maximum tuition assistance levels per course  which enables most of our military students to take courses with no out of pocket costs 
we anticipate no tuition increase for undergraduate students for the foreseeable future 
if we were to implement a tuition increase or if the dod were to lower the amount of tuition assistance per student  military students eligible for the us department of veterans affairs gi bill may apply that entitlement to cover the difference through the top up program 
a full semester hour undergraduate degree may be earned for  eligible undergraduate students receive their textbooks through our book grant program  which represents a potential average student savings over the course of a degree of approximately  when compared to a estimate by the general accounting office of average text book costs for a first time  full time student at four year public universities for the academic year 
most students transfer in significant prior credit earned  which also reduces the cost and time of earning their degree 
other than a modest increase in for graduate tuition  we have not raised tuition since graduate tuition is per semester hour  or per three semester credit hour course 
for military students  the service branch pays of the tuition costs per course  and students have the option of paying the remainder out of pocket or applying their gi bill entitlement to cover the cost above at these tuition rates  students may earn a graduate degree for less than  in tuition costs 
many students transfer credit from other institutions or military service schools  reducing their cost and time for earning a degree 
despite being an open enrollment institution  we do not charge an admission fee  nor do we charge fees for services such as registration  technology  course drops  and similar events that trigger fees at most institutions 
in addition  as a total distance learning institution  there are no resident fees  such as for parking  food service  student union and recreation 
while we charge a fee for transfer credit evaluation  unlike transfer credit fees at many institutions  the fee is a one time fee that does not increase as more credits are transferred 
in addition to military and veterans benefits  we offer a variety of federal and non federal aid programs to assist students with their education costs 
the federal student aid programs under title iv constituted of our net registrations in  and we expect that the ability to participate in these programs is important to our growth 
the following aid sources are available from military  federal  state  agency and local organizations to help students meet their education goals military and veterans student aid training funds tuition assistance veterans administration benefits gi bill other federal student aid  including title iv programs federal pell grant federal subsidized stafford loan federal unsubsidized stafford loan federal plus loan federal graduate plus loan academic competitiveness grant national science  mathematics and access to retain talent smart grant non federal student aid employer voucher private loans national sheriff s association scholarship undergraduate book grant enrollment and student body our student body consists of over  students  and most of them hold full time employment 
active students are defined as those who have completed a course in the past twelve months  or are currently enrolled or registered for an upcoming course 
we disenroll students who fail to register for and complete at least one course in a calendar year  although they may later reapply for admission and active status 
students on extended military deployments may apply for a program hold  which keeps them active until they return and are able to resume their studies 
faculty our faculty consists of over members with relevant teaching and practitioner experience 
as of december   approximately faculty members are designated as full time  and more than members are serving as adjunct faculty 
a significant majority of our graduate faculty hold a doctorate in the relevant field  while virtually all undergraduate faculty have earned a graduate degree 
exceptions are granted for a limited number of faculty who may not meet the degree standards  but evidence significant experience and achievement in the subject area they teach 
we establish full time and adjunct positions based on program and course enrollment 
many full time faculty began their career with us as adjunct members 
as enrollment increases  we expect to establish additional full time positions  as well as additional adjunct positions 
we attract faculty through referrals by current faculty members  advertisements in education and trade association journals  and prospective members discovering us through our internet presence 
program managers and department chairs review applications and conduct interviews 
we check references prior to offering positions to new faculty and  upon selection  we require each new faculty member to complete an orientation and training program that leads to their certification and assignment 
many of our faculty members have relevant experience at leading universities and within military and governmental institutions 
we believe that the composition of our student body and course curriculum is particularly attractive to potential faculty members because of the opportunity to teach relevant material to students that are involved on a daily basis in implementing what is being taught 
in turn  we believe that our well regarded faculty  including many former and current practitioners in their fields  attracts new students with interest in these fields 
we believe that the quality of our faculty is critical to our success  particularly because faculty members have the largest amount of interaction with our students 
we do not provide our faculty with tenure 
in addition  we regularly review the performance of our faculty  including monitoring the amount of online contact that faculty have with students  reviewing student feedback and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students 
if we determine that a faculty member is not performing at the level that we require  we work with the faculty member to improve performance  including through assigning the faculty member a mentor 
if the faculty member s performance does not improve  we will no longer allow that faculty member to teach 
partnership at a distance we have established proprietary information systems and processes to support what we refer to as partnership at a distance  or pad 
pad is our approach to how we interact with our students  and at its center is the pad system 
the pad system allows prospective and current students to interact with us exclusively online  on their schedule 
through pad we try to create learning partnerships with our students and faculty that remove time and distance barriers 
the pad system serves as the backbone for all online student interaction  other than the classroom  which is provided through a separate program that is integrated with the pad system 
we believe that the pad system empowers students to control the path to achieving their educational goals by providing them with access to resources without requiring intervention from staff 
the pad system also serves as a business workflow process designed to enable faculty and staff to make decisions for continuous process improvement based primarily on objective information and feedback from students 
through the pad system we are also able to manage on an automated and cost effective basis the complex administrative tasks resulting from offering monthly semester starts for over  classes in over unique courses to our over  students taught by over faculty members 
other technology systems and management we believe that we have established a functional  secure and reliable technology system to help us fulfill our mission 
we continue to invest in technology systems and enhancements to support this system and our growth 
our online classroom employs the web based portal learning management system  educator tm  from ucompass 
com  inc  for which we obtained a perpetual license with long term support commitments in the first quarter of our it infrastructure consists of two data centers  one at our headquarters in charles town  west virginia  and one at a co location facility in virginia 
our technology environment is managed internally 
student access is provided through redundant data carriers in both data centers 
competition there are more than  us colleges and universities serving traditional college age students and adult students 
competition is highly fragmented and varies by geography  program offerings  delivery method  ownership  quality level  and selectivity of admissions 
no one institution has a significant share of the total postsecondary market 
we compete with not for profit public and private two year and four year colleges as well as other for profit schools  particularly those that offer online learning programs 
public and private colleges and universities  as well as other for profit schools  offer programs similar to those we offer 
public institutions receive substantial government subsidies  and public and private institutions have access to government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for profit schools 
accordingly  public and private institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for profit sector 
in addition  some of our competitors  including both traditional colleges and universities and other for profit schools  have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have  which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students 
we also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market  including established colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs 
the primary competitive factors for institutions targeting working adult students include specific degree program offerings  affordability  including tuition and fees and rates of increase  convenience and flexibility  including availability of online courses  reputation and academic quality  and marketing effectiveness 
within our primary military market  there are more than  institutions that serve military students and receive tuition assistance funds 
our primary competitors for military students are other institutions offering online bachelor s and master s degrees and traditional colleges and universities located near military installations 
across all branches of military service  the primary institutions receiving funds  other than us  are the university of maryland university college umuc  the university of phoenix  park university  touro international university and varied institutions by branch  such as central texas college within the army and embry riddle aeronautical university for the air force 
intellectual property we exercise rights associated with copyrights  trademarks  service marks  domain names  agreements and registrations to protect our intellectual property 
course syllabi are our property  may be used in current and future courses as needed to facilitate instruction  and may be modified to meet evolving course or curriculum requirements 
intellectual property of individual faculty members  such as weekly notes or lectures  remains the property of the faculty member  and is reserved specifically for use only by the faculty member who owns it  unless he she grants permission for use by others 
we have secured a trademark for the phrase educating those who serve  which is used in promotional materials and messaging  as well as the brand names american military university  american public university and american community college  and we have applied for a trademark for the term partnership at a distance 
we also own rights to more than internet domain names pertaining to apus  amu  apu and other unique descriptors 
our proprietary student information and service system  the pad system  is pending patent with the patent and trademark office 
employees in addition to our faculty of over members  as of december   we had a professional staff of approximately non faculty members administering our academic  technology  service and business operations 
most of our employees work in either our headquarters in charles town  west virginia  or in our administrative offices in manassas  virginia 
all full time employees participate in an incentive compensation program  which enables staff and full time faculty to earn quarterly bonuses based on student retention and satisfaction factors  and an annual bonus based on financial performance 
none of our employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement 
we believe our relationships with our employees are good

we or our representatives are licensed or authorized to operate or to conduct activities in these states  excluding states that have notified as that we are exempt from licensure or authorization requirements  because we have determined  or the applicable regulatory agency has advised us  that our activities  or our representative s activities  in each state constitute a presence or involve an activity requiring licensure or authorization by the relevant state education agency 
in some cases  the licensure or authorization is only for specific programs or specific activities 
because we enroll students from each of the states  as well as the district of columbia  and because we may undertake activities in other states that constitute a presence or otherwise subject us to the jurisdiction of the respective state education agency  from time to time we will need to seek licensure or authorization in additional states 
the increasing popularity and use of the internet and other online services for the delivery of education has led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the united states or foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations 
these new laws  regulations and interpretations may relate to issues such as the requirement that online education institutions be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence 
for instance  in some states we are or may be required to seek licensure or authorization because our recruiters meet with prospective students in the state 
in other states  the state education agency requires  or may require  licensure or authorization because  for example  we enroll students or employ faculty who reside in the state 
some state education agencies that do not currently require us to be licensed or authorized may in the future require such licensure or authorization for a variety of reasons  including as a result of new laws or regulations  changes in our business  changes in the nature or amount of our contact or presence with the applicable state  or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations 
new laws  regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states  which could  in turn  negatively affect enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive regulations by the states in which we are authorized or licensed to operate 
state laws typically establish standards for instruction  qualifications of faculty  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations and other operational matters 
state laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees 
some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the department of education  and may require the posting of surety bonds 
if we fail to comply with state licensing requirements  we may lose our state licensure or authorizations 
although we believe that the only state authorization or licensure necessary for us to participate in the tuition assistance programs for the united states armed forces and in title iv programs is our authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission  failure to comply with authorization or licensure requirements in other states could restrict our ability to recruit or enroll students in those states 
failure to comply with the requirements of the west virginia higher education policy commission could result in our losing authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission  eligibility to participate in title iv programs  or ability to offer certain programs  any of which may force us to cease operations 
accreditation we received institutional accreditation in from the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools  a regional accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education 
our next comprehensive evaluation will be in  as part of a regularly scheduled evaluation process 
in november  the higher learning commission conducted a focused visit for the purpose of considering an expansion of our mission to include liberal arts bachelors degrees 
in december  the higher learning commission approved expansion of our mission to include liberal arts bachelors degrees 
the higher learning commission conducted a focused evaluation in february due to the august change in ownership under the higher learning commission s standards  and the site visitors did not identify concerns related to the august change and our accreditation status 
accreditation is a non governmental system for recognizing educational institutions and their programs for student performance  governance  integrity  educational quality  faculty  physical resources  administrative capability and resources  and financial stability 
in the united states  this recognition comes primarily through private voluntary associations that accredit institutions or programs of higher education 
to be recognized by the secretary of education  accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards and procedures for their review of educational institutions or programs 
accrediting agencies establish criteria for accreditation  conduct peer review evaluations of institutions and programs  and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria 
accredited schools are subject to periodic review by accrediting agencies to determine whether such schools maintain the performance  integrity  and quality required for accreditation 
the higher learning commission is the same accrediting agency that accredits such universities as the university of chicago  northwestern university  west virginia university  and other degree granting public and private colleges and universities in its region including  arkansas  arizona  colorado  iowa  illinois  indiana  kansas  michigan  minnesota  missouri  north dakota  nebraska  ohio  oklahoma  new mexico  south dakota  west virginia  wisconsin and wyoming 
accreditation by the higher learning commission is an important attribute of ours 
colleges and universities depend  in part  on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools 
employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating a candidate s credentials  and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards 
moreover  institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education is necessary for eligibility to participate in tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces and title iv programs 
in addition to regional accreditation  we have been accredited by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council  or detc  since detc is a national accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education 
the higher learning commission  and not detc  is our designated primary accreditor for title iv program purposes 
we believe many prospective students  employers  state licensing authorities and higher education organizations may view accreditation by a regional accrediting agency to be more prestigious than accreditation by a national accrediting agency  and loss of our regional accreditation would reduce the marketability of the american public university system even if we were to maintain our national accreditation 
we also believe that military personnel are counseled that regional accreditation is an important consideration when selecting a postsecondary institution and that there are further opportunities to leverage regional accreditation to service members  such as joining degree networks previously closed to us like the servicemember opportunity colleges degree network system  a dod program that promotes its member institutions to military professionals 
nature of federal  state and private financial support for postsecondary education our students finance their education through a combination of individual resources  tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces  private loans  corporate reimbursement programs  and title iv programs 
participation in these programs adds to the regulation of our operations 
service members of the united states armed forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the uniform tuition assistance program of the dod 
service members may use this tuition assistance to pursue postsecondary degrees at postsecondary schools that are accredited by accrediting agencies that are recognized by the secretary of education 
for our undergraduate programs we have established tuition per course that can be covered by dod tuition assistance funds  resulting in no out of pocket costs to undergraduate military students to attend our institution 
each branch of the armed forces has established its own rules for the tuition assistance programs of dod 
pursuant to these rules  in order for service members to use their tuition assistance funds at american public university system  we need to maintain our state licensure and either our regional or national accreditation and the service member must maintain satisfactory academic progress and must also progress in a timely manner toward completion of their degree 
to the extent that tuition assistance programs do not cover the full cost of tuition for service members  service members may also use their benefits under the montgomery gi bill administered by the us department of veterans affairs  or va  through the gi bill s top up feature 
if we lost our eligibility to receive tuition assistance from the united states armed forces  or if the amount of tuition assistance per service member is reduced  military service members would need to seek alternative funds 
while they may be able to use their education benefits under the montgomery gi bill in lieu of dod tuition assistance funds  we do not know if that option would be as attractive to these students 
as a result  the inability to participate in dod tuition assistance programs  and any reduction in the funding for dod tuition assistance programs  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through title iv programs  in the form of grants and loans to students who can use those funds at any institution that has been certified by the department of education to participate in title iv programs 
aid under title iv programs is primarily awarded on the basis of financial need  generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount a student can reasonably contribute to that cost 
all recipients of title iv program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress and must also progress in a timely manner toward completion of their program of study 
in addition  each school must ensure that title iv program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students 
we were first certified to participate in title iv programs in september the department of education has approved us to participate in the following title iv programs described below the federal family education loan program the ffel program  william d 
ford federal direct loan program the direct loan program  the federal pell grant program the pell program and campus based programs 
ffel program 
under the ffel program  banks and other lending institutions make loans to students and parents of dependent students 
the ffel program includes the federal stafford loan program  the federal plus program which beginning on july  provided for making loans to graduate and professional students as well as parents of dependent undergraduate students  and the federal consolidation loan program 
if a student defaults on a loan  payment is guaranteed by a federally recognized guaranty agency  which is then reimbursed by the department of education 
students who demonstrate financial need may qualify for a subsidized stafford loan 
with a subsidized stafford loan  the federal government will pay the interest on the loan while the student is in school and during any approved periods of deferment  until the student s obligation to repay the loan begins 
unsubsidized stafford loans are available to students who do not qualify for a subsidized stafford loan or  in some cases  in addition to a subsidized stafford loan 
direct loan program 
under the direct loan program  the department of education makes loan directly to students rather than guaranteeing loans made by lending institutions 
to date  we have not originated any loans under this program  but are taking steps to enable us to do so if we decide to participate actively in the program 
federal pell grant program 
grants under the federal pell grant program are available to eligible students based on financial need and other factors 
campus based programs 
the campus based title iv programs include the federal supplemental education opportunity grant program  the federal work study program and the federal perkins loan program 
in addition to the programs stated above  eligible students may participate in several other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental and private sources 
for example  some of our students who are veterans use their benefits under the gi bill to cover their tuition 
certain of our students are also eligible to receive funds from other education assistance programs administered by the va 
pursuant to federal law providing benefits for veterans and reservists  we are approved for education of veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies in virginia and west virginia 
we offer institutional financial aid to eligible students  such as members of the national sheriffs association 
in certain circumstances  our students may access alternative loan programs 
alternative loans are intended to cover the difference between what the student receives from all financial aid sources and the full cost of the student s education 
students can apply to a number of different lenders for this funding at current market interest rates 
finally  some of our students finance their own education or receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers 
on june   president bush signed the post veterans educational assistance act of the legislation  sometimes referred to as the new gi bill  expands education benefits for veterans who have served on active duty since september   including reservists and members of the national guard 
under the new gi bill  eligible veterans may receive benefits for tuition purposes up to the cost of in state tuition at the most expensive public institution of higher education in the state where the veteran is enrolled 
in addition  veterans who are not enrolled in distance education programs may receive monthly housing stipends 
veterans may also receive up to  per academic year for books and other education costs 
the provisions regarding benefits for post veterans are effective august  the legislation also increases the amount of education benefits available to eligible veterans under pre existing law  namely the montgomery gi bill  effective august  the legislation also authorizes expansion of service members ability to transfer veterans education benefits to family members 
we cannot predict with certainty whether and how the new gi bill  including the tuition benefit formula and the housing stipend provision s distance education exclusion  might affect our operations 
regulation of title iv financial aid programs to be eligible to participate in title iv programs  an institution must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the higher education act and the regulations issued thereunder by the department of education 
an institution must  among other things  be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state within which it is physically located in our case  west virginia and maintain institutional accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency 
in may  we were fully recertified to participate in title iv programs after having completed an initial period of participation during which we were provisionally certified 
in august  we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs 
in connection with this review  we submitted to the department of education a change in ownership application that included the submission of required documentation  including a letter from the higher learning commission indicating that it had approved the change 
on october   we received a letter from the department of education approving the change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september  see regulatory actions and restrictions on operations below for more information 
the substantial amount of federal funds disbursed through title iv programs  the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for profit institutions have caused congress to require the department of education to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for profit institutions of higher learning 
accrediting agencies and state education agencies also have responsibilities for overseeing compliance of institutions with title iv program requirements 
as a result  our institution is subject to extensive oversight and review 
because the department of education periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations  and because congress recently enacted legislation that imposes new obligations on institutions  we cannot predict with certainty how the title iv program requirements will be applied in all circumstances 
significant factors relating to title iv programs that could adversely affect us include the following congressional action 
congress reauthorizes the higher education act approximately every five to six years 
on july   congress completed the reauthorization process by passing the higher education opportunity act or heoa 
president bush signed the bill into law on august  heoa provisions are effective upon enactment  unless otherwise specified in the law 
selected heoa provisions are described in relevant parts of this annual report 
although congress took many years to complete reauthorization  three laws to amend and reauthorize aspects of the higher education act have been enacted in the meantime 
in february  president bush signed the deficit reduction act of  which includes the higher education reconciliation act of or hera 
among other measures  hera reauthorized the higher education act with respect to the federal guaranteed student loan programs 
in september  president bush signed the college cost reduction and access act  which increased benefits to students under title iv programs and reduced payments to and raised costs for lenders that participate in the federal student loan programs 
in may  president bush signed the ensuring continued access to student loans act of  which was designed to facilitate student loan availability and to increase student access to federal financial aid in light of current market conditions 
heoa includes numerous new and revised requirements for higher education institutions and thus increases substantially regulatory burdens imposed on such institutions under the higher education act 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect heoa s provisions will have on our business 
in addition  we cannot predict with certainty whether or when congress might act to amend further the higher education act 
the elimination of certain title iv programs  material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs  or the substitution of materially different programs could increase our costs of compliance and could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institution 
the department of education has stated that affected parties are responsible for taking steps to comply by the effective dates established in heoa  even though the department of education has yet to issue regulations to implement heoa s provisions 
the department of education started the negotiated rulemaking process for certain parts of heoa by holding a series of public meetings in september and october of the higher education act requires negotiated rulemaking for the development of all regulations implementing statutory changes to title iv of the higher education act  which contains the federal student financial assistance programs 
the department of education recently established five negotiated rulemaking committees and has published tentative negotiation schedules that began in february the department of education has explained that where negotiated rulemaking is not required  heoa s provisions will be implemented either through the usual notice and comment processor  where regulations will merely reflect the changes to the higher education act and not expand upon those changes  as technical changes 
we cannot predict how the department of education will interpret heoa s provisions through rulemaking or otherwise 
if our efforts to comply with heoa s provisions are inconsistent with how the department of education interprets those provisions in final regulations or otherwise  we may be found to be in noncompliance with such provisions and the department of education could impose monetary penalties  place limitations on our operations  and or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds 
in addition  congress reviews and determines appropriations for title iv programs on an annual basis through the budget and appropriations process 
a reduction in federal funding levels of such programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education 
these changes  in turn  could lead to lower enrollments  require us to increase our reliance upon alternative sources of student financial aid and impact our growth plans 
the loss of or a significant reduction in title iv program funds available to our students could reduce our enrollment and revenue and possibly have a material adverse effect on our business and plans for growth 
in addition  the legislation and implementing regulations applicable to our operations have been subject to frequent revisions  many of which have increased the level of scrutiny to which for profit postsecondary education institutions are subjected and have raised applicable standards 
if we were not to continue to comply with legislation and implementing regulations applicable to our operations  such noncompliance might impair our ability to participate in title iv programs  offer educational programs or continue to operate 
certain of the statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to us are described below 
eligibility and certification procedures 
each institution must apply periodically to the department of education for continued certification to participate in title iv programs 
such recertification generally is required every six years  but may be required earlier  including when an institution undergoes a change of control 
an institution may come under the department of education s review when it expands its activities in certain ways  such as opening an additional location or  in certain cases  when it modifies academic credentials that it offers 
the department of education may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances  such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control 
during the period of provisional certification  the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement 
in addition  the department of education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for approval to open a new location  add an educational program  acquire another school or make any other significant change 
if the department of education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement  it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in title iv programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified 
students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive title iv program funds 
we are currently provisionally certified because we have recently undergone a change in ownership and control 
on october   we received a letter from the department of education approving our august deemed change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september  see regulatory actions and restrictions on operations for more information 
distance learning and repeal of the rules 
we offer all of our existing degree  diploma and certificate programs via internet based telecommunications from our headquarters in charles town  west virginia 
prior to passage of hera  as part of the deficit reduction act of  the higher education act generally excluded from title iv programs institutions at which more than of the institution s courses were offered via correspondence methods  which included online courses under certain circumstances  or or more of the institution s students were enrolled in courses delivered via correspondence methods  which included online courses under certain circumstances ie  the rules 
because of our courses are online courses  the rule regarding online courses previously disqualified us from participation in title iv programs 
as part of the amendments to the higher education act  the department of education was authorized to waive specific statutory and regulatory requirements in order to assess the viability of online educational offerings 
under the distance education demonstration program  or demonstration program  institutions were allowed to seek waivers of certain regulatory provisions that inhibited the offering of distance education programs  including the rules 
participation in the demonstration program included regular submissions of data to the department of education 
only institutions that were accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by the secretary of education for purposes of participation in title iv programs were allowed to participate in the demonstration program 
we were not eligible to participate in the demonstration program  because at the time the department of education was accepting applicants we were accredited exclusively by the distance education and training council  whose accrediting authority at that time did not extend to title iv programs 
effective july   the rules were repealed for telecommunications courses which include online courses as part of hera  but remain in place for traditional correspondence courses 
accordingly  online institutions such as us  which offer their courses exclusively through telecommunications  are no longer subject to the rules 
following passage of hera  the department of education also terminated the demonstration program effective as of june  under heoa  an accreditor that evaluates institutions offering distance education must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program 
at this time we cannot predict with certainty how our accreditors will interpret this provision for purposes of their own requirements and whether such interpretation will impact our operations 
administrative capability 
department of education regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in title iv programs 
failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead the department of education to find the institution ineligible to participate in title iv programs or to place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its participation 
to meet the administrative capability standards  an institution must  among other things comply with all applicable title iv program regulations  have capable and sufficient personnel to administer title iv programs  have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students  not have cohort default rates above specified levels  have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds  not be  and not have any principal or affiliate who is  debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension  provide financial aid counseling to its students  refer to the department of education s office of inspector general any credible information indicating that any applicant  student  employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving title iv programs  submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations  and not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability 
if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or any other department of education regulation  the department of education may require the repayment of title iv funds  transfer the institution from the advance system of payment of title iv funds to cash monitoring status or to the reimbursement system of payment  place the institution on provisional certification status  or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit  suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in title iv programs 
if we are found not to have satisfied the department of education s administrative capability requirements  we could lose  or be limited in our access to  title iv program funding 
third party servicers 
department of education regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution s participation in title iv programs 
the third party servicer must  among other obligations  comply with title iv requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the secretary of education for any violation by the servicer of any title iv provision 
an institution must report to the department of education new contracts with or any significant modifications to contracts with third party servicers as well as other matters related to third party servicers 
we contract with the third party servicer global financial aid services  inc  which performs activities related to our participation in title iv programs 
if global financial aid services does not comply with applicable statute and regulations including the higher education act  we may be liable for their actions and we could lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
financial responsibility 
the higher education act and department of education regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as us must satisfy in order to participate in title iv programs 
these standards generally require that an institution provide the resources necessary to comply with title iv program requirements and meet all of its financial obligations  including required refunds and any repayments to the department of education for liabilities incurred in programs administered by the department of education 
the department of education evaluates institutions on an annual basis for compliance with specified financial responsibility standards 
generally  the standards require an institution to receive an unqualified opinion from its accountants on its audited financial statements  maintain sufficient cash reserves to satisfy refund requirements  meet all of its financial obligations and remain current on its debt payments 
the financial responsibility standards include a complex formula that uses line items from the institution s audited financial statements 
the formula focuses on three financial ratios equity ratio which measures the institution s capital resources  financial viability and ability to borrow  primary reserve ratio which measures the institution s viability and liquidity  and net income ratio which measures the institution s profitability or ability to operate within its means 
an institution s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further federal oversight 
the department of education may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution 
at the request of the department of education  we supply our consolidated financial statements to the department of education for purposes of calculating the composite score 
we have applied the financial responsibility standards to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   and calculated a composite score of out of a maximum score of we therefore believe that we meet the department of education s composite score standards 
if the department of education were to determine that we did not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other factors  we may be able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis by  among other things posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least of the total title iv program funds received by us during our most recently completed fiscal year  posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least of such prior year s title iv program funds received by us  accepting provisional certification  complying with additional department of education monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive title iv program funds under an arrangement other than the department of education s standard advance payment arrangement such as the reimbursement system of payment or cash monitoring  or complying with additional department of education monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive title iv program funds under an arrangement other than the department of education s standard advance payment arrangement such as the reimbursement system of payment or cash monitoring 
failure to meet the department of education s financial responsibility requirements  because we do not meet the department of education s minimum composite score to establish financial responsibility or are unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis or fail to meet other financial responsibility requirements  would cause us to lose access to title iv program funding 
title iv return of funds 
under the department of education s return of funds regulations  when a student withdraws an institution must return unearned funds to the department of education in a timely manner 
an institution must first determine the amount of title iv program funds that a student earned 
if the student withdraws during the first of any period of enrollment or payment period  the amount of title iv program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible 
if the student withdraws after the threshold  then the student has earned of the title iv program funds 
the institution must return to the appropriate title iv programs  in a specified order  the lesser of i the unearned title iv program funds or ii the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned title iv program funds 
an institution must return the funds no later than days after the date of the institution s determination that a student withdrew 
if such payments are not timely made  an institution may be subject to adverse action  including being required to submit a letter of credit equal to of the refunds the institution should have made in its most recently completed fiscal year 
under department of education regulations  late returns of title iv program funds for or more of students sampled in the institution s annual compliance audit constitutes material noncompliance 
the rule 
a requirement of the higher education act  commonly referred to as the rule  applies only to proprietary institutions of higher education  which includes us 
under the higher education act  a proprietary institution is prohibited from deriving  on a cash accounting basis  more than of its revenues for any fiscal year from title iv funds 
prior to the adoption of heoa  an institution that violated the rule became ineligible to participate in title iv programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which it exceeded  and it was unable to apply to regain its eligibility until the next fiscal year 
heoa changed the rule from an eligibility requirement to a compliance obligation that is part of an institution s program participation agreement with the department of education 
accordingly  heoa generally lessens the severity of noncompliance with the rule  although repeated noncompliance will result in loss of eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
under the terms of heoa  a proprietary institution of higher education that violates the rule for any fiscal year will be placed on provisional status for two fiscal years 
proprietary institutions of higher education that violate the rule for two consecutive fiscal years will become ineligible to participate in title iv programs for at least two fiscal years and will be required to demonstrate compliance with title iv eligibility and certification requirements for at least two fiscal years prior to resuming title iv program participation 
heoa generally codifies the formula for rule calculations as set forth in current department of education regulations  but also expands on the department of education s formula in certain respects  including by broadening the categories of funds that may be counted as revenue for rule purposes 
heoa s changes to the rule are effective upon enactment  which occurred on august  student loan defaults 
under the higher education act  an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the title iv programs if defaults on the repayment of ffel program or direct loan program loans by its students exceed certain levels 
for each federal fiscal year  a rate of student defaults known as a cohort default rate is calculated for each institution with or more borrowers entering repayment in a given federal fiscal year by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year default by the end of the next federal fiscal year 
for such institutions  the department of education calculates a single cohort default rate for each federal fiscal year that includes in the cohort all current or former student borrowers at the institution who entered repayment on any ffel program or direct loan program loan during that year 
if the department of education notifies an institution that its cohort default rates for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years are or greater  the institution s participation in the ffel program  direct loan program and pell program ends days after the notification  unless the institution appeals in a timely manner that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures 
in addition  an institution s participation in the ffel program and direct loan program ends days after notification that its most recent cohort default rate is greater than  unless the institution timely appeals that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures 
an institution whose participation ends under these provisions may not participate in the relevant programs for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the institution receives the notification  as well as for the next two fiscal years 
if an institution s cohort default rate equals or exceeds in any single year  the institution may be placed on provisional certification status 
provisional certification does not limit an institution s access to title iv program funds  however  an institution with provisional status is subject to closer review by the department of education and may be subject to summary adverse action if it violates title iv program requirements 
because we have begun only recently to enroll students who are participating in the federal student loan programs  we have no historical cohort default rate 
relatively few students are expected to enter the repayment phase in the near term  which could result in defaults by a few students having a relatively large impact on our cohort default rate 
heoa modified the higher education act s cohort default rate provisions related to ffel program loans and direct loan program loans 
beginning with cohort default rate calculations for federal fiscal year  the cohort default rate will be calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in the relevant federal fiscal year default by the end of the second following federal fiscal year 
the current method of calculating rates will remain in effect and will be used to determine institutional eligibility until three consecutive years of cohort default rates calculated under the new formula are available 
in addition  effective as of federal fiscal year  the cohort default rate threshold of will be increased to 
an institution whose cohort default rate is equal to or greater than for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years for which data are available will be ineligible to participate in title iv programs 
if an institution s cohort default rate is or more in a given fiscal year  the institution will be required to assemble a default prevention task force and submit to the department of education a default improvement plan 
an institution that exceeds for two consecutive years will be required to review  revise and resubmit its default improvement plan  and the department of education may direct that such plan be amended to include actions  with measurable objectives  that it determines will promote loan repayment 
an institution whose cohort default rate is or more for any two consecutive federal fiscal years may file an appeal to demonstrate exceptional mitigating circumstances and  if the secretary of education determines that the institution demonstrated such circumstances  the secretary may not subject the institution to provisional certification based solely on the institution s cohort default rate 
at this time  we cannot predict the effect that this change may have on our ability to meet cohort default rate standards 
incentive compensation rules 
as part of an institution s program participation agreement with the department of education and in accordance with the higher education act  an institution may not provide any commission  bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment  admissions or financial aid awarding activity based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid 
certain department of education regulations clarify the incentive payment rule 
the regulations set forth safe harbors  which describe payments or arrangements that do not violate the incentive payment rule 
failure to comply with the incentive compensation rule could result in termination of participation in title iv programs  limitation on participation in title iv programs  or financial penalties 
although there can be no assurance that the department of education would not find deficiencies in our present or former employee compensation and third party contractual arrangements  we believe that our employee compensation and third party contractual arrangements comply with the incentive compensation provisions of the higher education act and department of education regulations thereunder 
code of conduct related to student loans 
heoa adds a new requirement  as part of an institution s program participation agreement with the department of education  that institutions that participate in title iv programs adopt a code of conduct pertinent to student loans 
for financial aid office or other employees who have responsibility related to education loans  the code must forbid  with limited exceptions  gifts  consulting arrangements with lenders  and advisory board compensation other than reasonable expense reimbursement 
the code also must ban revenue sharing arrangements  opportunity pools that lenders offer in exchange for certain promises and staffing assistance from lenders 
the institution must post the code prominently on its website and ensure that its officers  employees  and agents who have financial aid responsibilities are informed annually of the code s provisions 
in addition to the code of conduct requirements that apply to institutions  heoa contains provisions that apply to federal and private lenders  prohibiting such lenders from engaging in certain activities as they interact with institutions 
failure to comply with the code of conduct provision could result in termination of our participation in title iv programs  limitations on participation in title iv programs  or financial penalties 
preferred lender lists 
the department of education recently published regulations  effective july   that in part address institutions student loan activity 
in particular  the department of education s regulations establish new rules applicable to institutions that make available a list of recommended or suggested lenders for use by potential borrowers 
for example  an institution must include at least three unaffiliated lenders on a list  must disclose the method and criteria used to select lenders  must provide comparative information about benefits offered by listed lenders  must include a prominent statement that borrowers may select a lender not on the list  and must update the list and accompanying information at least annually 
under heoa  institutions that receive any federal funding and enter into preferred lender arrangements must comply with certain requirements related to development and disclosure of preferred lender list 
such institutions must submit annual reports to the department of education that explain  among other matters  why the institution has a preferred lender arrangement 
such institution also must publish a code of conduct with certain specified provisions 
if the institution participates in title iv programs  the institution s preferred lender list must satisfy certain requirements  many of which are included in current department of education regulations 
in addition  heoa requires an institution to exercise a duty of care and a duty of loyalty to compile a preferred lender list without prejudice and for the sole benefit of students at the institution and their families 
the list must cover the institution s preferred lender arrangements related to federal and private loans 
institutions with preferred lenders also must make certain disclosures based on information provided annually by the lender to the institution for each type of loan offered under a preferred lender arrangement 
failure to comply with preferred lender list rules under the higher education act or the department of education s regulations could result in termination of participation in title iv programs  limitations on participation in federal student financial aid programs  or financial penalties 
college affordability and transparency lists 
under heoa  beginning july   the department of education will publish on its website lists of the top five percent of institutions  in each of nine categories  with the highest tuition and fees for the most recent academic year  the highest net price for the most recent academic year  the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees for the most recent three academic years  and the largest percentage increase in net price for the most recent three academic years 
an institution that is placed on a list for high percentage increases in either tuition and fees or in net price must submit a report to the department of education explaining the increases and the steps that it intends to take to reduce costs 
the department of education will report annually to congress on these institutions and will publish their reports on its web site 
the department of education also will post lists of the top of institutions in each of the nine categories with lowest tuition and fees or the lowest net price for the most recent academic year 
under heoa  net price means average yearly price actually charged to first time  full time undergraduate students who receive student aid at a higher education institution after such aid is deducted 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect such lists will have on our operations 
compliance reviews 
we are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies  including the department of education  its office of inspector general oig  state licensing agencies  agencies that guarantee ffel program loans  the department of veterans affairs and accrediting agencies 
as part of the department of education s ongoing monitoring of institutions administration of title iv programs  the higher education act and department of education regulations also require institutions to submit annually a compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with government auditing standards and applicable audit standards of the department of education 
in addition  to enable the secretary of education to make a determination of financial responsibility  institutions must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with department of education regulations 
privacy 
the family educational rights and privacy act of  or ferpa  and the department of education s ferpa regulations require institutions to allow students to review and request changes to such student s education records maintained by the institution  notify students at least annually of this inspection right  and maintain records in each student s file listing requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in the student s personally identifiable information 
ferpa also limits the disclosure of a student s personally identifiable information by an institution without such student s prior written consent 
if an institution fails to comply with ferpa or the department of education s ferpa regulations  the department of education may require corrective actions by the institution  withhold further payments under any applicable title iv program or terminate an institution s eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
in addition  an institution participating in any title iv program is obligated to safeguard customer information pursuant to applicable provisions of the gramm leach bliley act  or glba  and federal trade commission  or ftc  regulations 
glba and ftc regulations require an institution to develop and maintain a comprehensive information security program to protect personally identifiable financial information of students  parents or other individuals with whom an institution has a customer relationship 
if an institution fails to comply with glba or ftc regulations  it may be required to take corrective actions  be subject to ftc monitoring and oversight  and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the ftc 
potential effect of regulatory violations 
if we fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing title iv programs  the department of education could impose one or more sanctions  including transferring us to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment  seeking to require repayment of certain title iv program funds  requiring us to post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education as a condition for continued title iv certification  taking emergency action against us  referring the matter for criminal prosecution or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit  condition  suspend or terminate our participation in title iv programs 
in addition  the agencies that guarantee ffel program loans for our students could initiate proceedings to limit  suspend or terminate our eligibility to provide guaranteed student loans in the event of certain regulatory violations 
if such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against us and resulted in a substantial curtailment  or termination  of our participation in title iv programs  our enrollments  revenues and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we lost our eligibility to participate in title iv programs  or if congress reduced the amount of available federal student financial aid  we would seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students 
although we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending our universities  there is no assurance that this would be the case  and the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid might not be as favorable as those for title iv program funds 
we may be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid 
accordingly  the loss of our eligibility to participate in title iv programs  or a reduction in the amount of available federal student financial aid  would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our growth plans and results of operations even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid 
in addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in title iv  we also may be subject  from time to time  to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies  but also by other government agencies and third parties  such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public 
regulatory actions and restrictions on operations many actions that we may wish to take in connection with our operations are also subject to regulation from a variety of agencies 
restrictions on adding educational programs 
state requirements and accrediting agency standards may  in certain instances  limit our ability to establish additional programs 
many states require approval before institutions can add new programs under specified conditions 
the higher learning commission  detc  and the west virginia higher education policy commission require institutions to notify them in advance of implementing new programs  and upon notification may undertake a review of the institution s licensure  authorization or accreditation 
under the higher education act and department of education regulations  a proprietary institution of higher education must have been in existence for at least two years in order to be eligible to participate in title iv programs 
the department of education considers an institution to have been in existence for two years if it was legally authorized to give and continuously was giving the same postsecondary instruction for at least two consecutive years 
thus  when a for profit institution applies to participate in title iv programs for the first time  it must show that it is in compliance with the so called two year rule 
an institution subject to the two year rule may not award title iv funds to a student in a program that is not included in the institution s approval documents 
for institutions that are subject to the two year rule  during the institution s initial period of participation in title iv programs  the department of education will not approve additional programs that would expand the scope of the institution s eligibility 
the department of education may provide an exception to such limitation if the institution demonstrates that the program has been legally authorized and continuously provided for at least two years prior to the date of the request 
in addition  when an institution is certified for the first time  its certification is provisional until the department of education has reviewed a compliance audit that covers a complete fiscal year of title iv program participation and has decided to certify fully the institution 
in the first quarter of  we timely filed a recertification application because our initial period of certification was scheduled to end on june  as part of that recertification process  the department of education fully certified us and it no longer considers us to be in our initial period of certification 
however  in august  we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs 
on october  the department of education approved our change in ownership application and granted us provisional certification for a two year period ending september  our program participation agreement provides that as a provisionally certified institution  we must apply for and receive approval by the secretary for any substantial change 
under our program participation agreement  substantial changes include but are not limited to establishment of additional locations  an increase in the level of academic offering  and addition of any non degree or short term training program 
the department of education has advised us that an institution that is provisionally certified based on a change in ownership and control that resulted from a reduction of ownership interest is able to add new degree programs under the same conditions that apply to a fully certified institution 
generally  if an institution that is not subject to the two year rule or is not in its initial period of certification adds an educational program after it has been designated as an eligible institution  the institution must apply to the department of education to have the additional program designated as eligible 
however  a fully certified degree granting institution is not obligated to obtain the department of education s approval of additional programs that lead to an associate  bachelor s  professional or graduate degree at the same degree level s previously approved by the department of education 
similarly  a fully certified institution is not required to obtain advance approval for new programs that both prepare students for gainful employment in the same or related recognized occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated as an eligible program at that institution and meet certain minimum length requirements 
however  the department of education  as a condition of certification to participate in title iv programs  can require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add 
in the event that an institution that is required to obtain the department of education s express approval for the addition of a new program fails to do so  and erroneously determines that the new educational program is eligible for title iv program funds  the institution may be liable for repayment of title iv program funds received by the institution or students in connection with that program 
change in ownership resulting in a change of control 
many states and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status  but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary among states and accrediting agencies 
in addition  our accrediting agencies  the higher learning commission and the distance education and training council  require institutions that they accredit to inform them in advance of any substantive change  including a change that significantly alters the ownership or control of the institution 
examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to the higher learning commission and to the distance education and training council include changes in the legal status  ownership  or form of control of the institution  such as the sale of a proprietary institution 
the higher learning commission must approve a substantive change in advance in order to include the change in the institution s accreditation status 
the higher learning commission also requires an on site evaluation within six months to confirm the appropriateness of the approval 
the distance education and training council requires advance notification and an on site evaluation within six months for the purpose of reaffirming the institution s accreditation 
the higher education act provides that an institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in title iv programs and must apply to the department of education in order to reestablish such eligibility 
an institution is ineligible to receive title iv program funds during the period prior to recertification 
the higher education act provides that the department of education may temporarily provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change in ownership and control based on preliminary review by the department of education of a materially complete application received by the department of education within business days after the transaction 
the department of education may continue such temporary  provisional certification on a month to month basis until it has rendered a final decision on the institution s application 
if the department of education determines to approve the application after a change in ownership and control  it issues a provisional certification  which extends for a period expiring not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date of provisional certification 
department of education regulations describe some transactions that constitute a change of control  including the transfer of a controlling interest in the voting stock of an institution or the institution s parent corporation 
department of education regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly traded corporation occurs in one of two ways i if there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a current report on form k with the sec disclosing a change of control or ii if the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation  and that stockholder ceases to own at least of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder 
a significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by the department of education to be a change in ownership and control under this standard 
when a change of ownership resulting in a change of control occurs  the department of education applies a different set of financial tests to determine the financial responsibility of the institution in conjunction with its review and approval of the change of ownership 
the institution generally is required to submit a same day audited balance sheet reflecting the financial condition of the institution immediately following the change in ownership 
the institution s same day balance sheet must demonstrate an acid test ratio of at least  which is calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities and excluding all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables 
the same day balance sheet must demonstrate positive tangible net worth 
when a publicly traded company undergoes a change in ownership and control due to a reduction in ownership interest  as occurred when funds affiliated with abs capital partners recently distributed approximately  shares of our stock to its general and limited partners  the institution may submit its most recent quarterly financial statement as filed with the sec  along with copies of all other sec filings made after the close of the fiscal year for which a compliance audit has been submitted to the department of education  instead of the same day balance sheet 
in addition  when a change in ownership and control occurs and there is a new owner  the institution must submit to the department of education audited financial statements of the institution s new owner s two most recently completed fiscal years that are prepared and audited in accordance with department of education requirements 
the department may determine whether the financial statements meet financial responsibility standards with respect to the composite score formula 
if the institution does not satisfy these requirements  the department of education may condition its approval of the change of ownership on the institution s agreeing to letters of credit  provisional certification  and or additional monitoring requirements  as described in the above section on financial responsibility 
if the new owner does not have the required audited financial statements  the department of education may impose certain restrictions on the institution  including with respect to adding locations and programs 
in august  funds affiliated with abs capital partners reduced their beneficial ownership interest from approximately to approximately of our outstanding common stock by distributing to their limited partners and general partners  shares of our stock 
as a result of such distribution  we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs 
as required under department of education regulations  we timely notified the department of education of our change in ownership and control 
in connection with the department of education s review of the change  we submitted to the department of education a change in ownership application that included the submission of required documentation  including a letter from the higher learning commission indicating that it had approved the change 
on october   we received a letter from the department of education approving the change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september  many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control requiring approval 
a change of control under the definitions of an agency that regulates us might require us to obtain approval of the change in ownership and control in order to maintain our regulatory approval 
under certain circumstances  the west virginia higher education policy commission and the state council of higher education for virginia might require us to seek approval of changes in ownership and control in order to maintain our state authorization or licensure 
with respect to the abs funds august distribution of  shares of our stock to their limited and general partners  the state council of higher education for virginia did not consider the distribution to be a change in ownership under its regulations and the west virginia higher education policy commission approved the change 
pursuant to federal law providing benefits for veterans and reservists  we are approved for education of veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies in west virginia and virginia 
in certain circumstances  state approving agencies may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control 
a change of control could occur as a result of future transactions in which we are involved 
some corporate reorganizations and some changes in the board of directors are examples of such transactions 
moreover  as a publicly traded company  the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale  purchase  transfer  issuance or redemption of our stock 
in addition  the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could discourage bids for your shares of common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of your shares 
item a 
risk factors risk factors investing in our common stock has a high degree of risk 
before making an investment in our common stock  you should carefully consider the following risks  as well as the other information contained in this annual report  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business if we are unable to continue our recent revenue and earnings growth  our stock price may decline and we may not have adequate financial resources to execute our business plan 
our revenue increased from million in to million in  and it increased from million in to million in  primarily due to strong referrals from current students  new student marketing  and the receipt of regional accreditation in may the same factors that led to the growth in revenues also contributed to our net income improving to million in from million in the rate of revenue growth from to was at a lower pace than the rate of growth from to as our revenue base grows  we expect our growth rate percentages to decline 
you should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of our future operating performance 
if we are unable to maintain adequate revenue and earnings growth  or if investors react negatively to the slowing of our growth rates  the value of our stock price may decline 
our growth may place a strain on our resources that could adversely affect our systems  controls and operating efficiency 
the growth that we have experienced in the past  as well as any future growth that we experience  may place a significant strain on our resources and increase demands on our management information and reporting systems and financial management controls 
we do not have experience scheduling courses and administering programs for more students than our current enrollment  and if growth negatively impacts our ability to do so  the learning experience for our students could be adversely affected  resulting in a higher rate of student attrition and fewer student referrals 
we also have limited experience adding to our courses  programs and operations through acquisitions 
future growth will also require continued improvement of our internal controls and systems  particularly those related to complying with federal regulations under the higher education act of  or the higher education act  as administered by the us department of education  including as a result of our participation in federal student financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act  which we refer to in this annual report as title iv programs 
we have described some of the most significant regulatory risks that apply to us  including those related to title iv programs  under the heading risks related to the regulation of our industry below 
if we are unable to manage our growth or successfully carry out and integrate acquisitions  we may also experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 
tuition assistance programs offered to united states armed forces personnel constituted of our net course registrations for  and our revenues and number of students would decrease if we are no longer able to receive funds under these tuition assistance programs or tuition assistance is reduced or eliminated 
service members of the united states armed forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of the armed forces that they may use to pursue postsecondary degrees 
service members of the united states armed forces can use tuition assistance at postsecondary schools that are accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by the us secretary of education 
our tuition is currently structured so that tuition assistance payments for service members fully cover the service member s per course tuition cost of our undergraduate courses and cover more than of the per course tuition cost of our graduate courses 
if we are no longer able to receive tuition assistance payments or the tuition assistance program is reduced or eliminated  our enrollments and revenues would be significantly reduced resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
strong competition in the postsecondary education market  especially in the online education market  could decrease our market share and increase our cost of acquiring students 
postsecondary education is highly fragmented and competitive 
we compete with traditional public and private two year and four year colleges as well as other for profit schools  particularly those that offer online learning programs 
public and private colleges and universities  as well as other for profit schools  offer programs similar to those we offer 
public institutions receive substantial government subsidies  and public and private institutions have access to government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for profit schools 
accordingly  public and private institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for profit sector 
in addition  some of our competitors  including both traditional colleges and universities and other for profit schools  have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have  which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students  particularly in the non military sector of the market 
we also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market  including established colleges and universities that have not previously offered online education programs 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business or results of operations 
we may also face increased competition if our competitors pursue relationships with the military and governmental educational programs with which we already have relationships 
these competitive factors could cause our enrollments  revenues and profitability to decrease significantly 
if we are unable to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner  our future growth may be impaired 
the updates and expansions of our existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers 
if we cannot respond to changes in market requirements  our business may be adversely affected 
even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs  we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs 
to offer a new academic program  we may be required to obtain appropriate federal  state and accrediting agency approvals  which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans 
under certain circumstances or because we are currently provisionally certified by the department of education  to be eligible for title iv programs  a new academic program may need to be approved by the department of education 
if we are unable to respond adequately to changes in market requirements due to financial constraints  regulatory limitations or other factors  our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer 
establishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires us to make investments in management  incur marketing expenses and reallocate other resources 
we may have limited experience with the courses in new areas and may need to modify our systems and strategy or enter into arrangements with other institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably 
if we are unable to increase the number of students  or offer new programs in a cost effective manner  or are otherwise unable to manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we do not have adequate continued personal referrals and marketing and advertising programs that are effective in developing awareness among  attracting and retaining new students  our financial performance in the future would suffer 
building awareness of amu and apu and the programs we offer among potential students is critical to our ability to attract new students 
in order to maintain and increase our revenues and profits  we must continue to attract new students in a cost effective manner and these students must remain active in our programs 
during  we increased the amounts spent on marketing and advertising  and we anticipate this trend to continue  particularly as a result of our attempts to attract and retain students from non military market sectors 
we use marketing tools such as the internet  exhibits at conferences  and print media advertising to promote our schools and programs 
additionally  we rely on the general reputation of amu and apu and referrals from current students  alumni and educational service officers in the united states armed forces as a source of new students 
some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully advertising and marketing our programs and from successfully enrolling and retaining students in our programs include the emergence of more successful competitors  factors related to our marketing  including the costs of internet advertising and broad based branding campaigns  performance problems with our online systems  failure to maintain accreditation  student dissatisfaction with our services and programs  failure to develop a message or image that resonates well within non military sectors of the market  adverse publicity regarding us  our competitors or online or for profit education generally  adverse developments in our relationship with military educational service officers  a decline in the acceptance of online education  and a decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs 
if we are unable to continue to develop awareness of amu and apu and the programs we offer  and to enroll and retain students in both military and non military market sectors  our enrollments would suffer and our ability to increase revenues and maintain profitability would be significantly impaired 
system disruptions and security breaches to our online computer networks could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and damage our reputation  limiting our ability to attract and retain students 
the performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students 
any system error or failure  or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage  could result in the unavailability of our online classroom  damaging our ability to generate revenue 
our technology infrastructure could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control  including natural disasters  terrorist activities and telecommunications failures 
our systems  particularly those related to our partnership at a distance  or pad  system  have been predominantly developed in house  with limited support from outside vendors 
we are continuously working on upgrades to the pad system  and our employees continue to devote substantial time to its development 
to the extent that we face problems with the pad system  we may not have the capacity to address the problems with our internal capability  and we may not be able to identify outside contractors with expertise relevant to our custom system 
any failure of our online classroom system could also prevent students from accessing their courses 
any interruption to our technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students and could require us to incur additional expenses to correct or mitigate the interruption 
our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer hackers  computer viruses and other security problems 
a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information  personal information about our students or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations 
as a result  we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
we engage multiple security assessment providers on a periodic basis to review and assess our security 
we utilize this information to audit ourselves to ensure that we are continually monitoring the security of our technology infrastructure 
however  we cannot assure you that these security assessments and audits will protect our computer networks against the threat of security breaches 
we use third party software for our online classroom  and if the provider of that software were to cease to do business or was acquired by a competitor  we may have difficulty maintaining the software required for our online classroom or updating it for future technological changes  which could adversely affect our performance 
our online classroom employs the educator tm learning management system pursuant to a license from ucompass 
com  inc the educator system is a web based portal that stores and delivers course content  provides interactive communication between students and faculty  and supplies online evaluation tools 
we rely on ucompass for ongoing support and customization and integration of the educator system with the rest of our technology infrastructure 
if ucompass ceased to operate or was unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with service  we may have difficulty maintaining the software required for our online classroom or updating it for future technological changes 
any failure to maintain our online classroom would have an adverse impact on our operations  damage our reputation and limit our ability to attract and retain students 
future growth or increased technology demands will require continued investment of capital  time and resources to develop and update our technology and if we are unable to increase the capacity of our resources appropriately  our ability to handle growth  our ability to attract or retain students and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we believe that continued growth will require us to increase the capacity and capabilities of our technology infrastructure  including our pad system 
increasing the capacity and capabilities of our technology infrastructure will require us to invest capital  time and resources  and there is no assurance that even with sufficient investment our systems will be scalable to accommodate future growth 
we may also need to invest capital  time and resources to update our technology in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace 
if we are unable to increase the capacity of our resources or update our resources appropriately  our ability to handle growth  our ability to attract or retain students  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the loss of any key member of our management team may impair our ability to operate effectively and may harm our business 
our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
the loss of one or more members of our management team could harm our business 
except for the employment agreements we have with mr 
boston  dr 
mccluskey and mr 
wilkins  we do not have employment agreements with any of our other executive officers or key personnel 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
if we are unable to attract and retain faculty  administrators  management and skilled personnel  our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed 
to execute our growth strategy  we must attract and retain highly qualified faculty  administrators  management and skilled personnel 
competition for hiring these individuals is intense  especially with regard to faculty in specialized areas 
if we fail to attract new skilled personnel or faculty or fail to retain and motivate our existing faculty  administrators  management and skilled personnel  our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed 
the protection of our operations through exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property is limited  and we encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties  any of which could harm our operations and prospects 
in the ordinary course of our business  we develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of copyright  trademark  service mark  patent  trade secret or other protections 
this intellectual property includes but is not limited to courseware materials and business know how and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of operating and various education regulatory agencies 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secrets  domain names  agreements and registrations to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on service mark and trademark protection in the united states and select foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to the marks american military university  american public university  american public university system and educating those who serve  as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services 
we rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third party content experts 
we cannot assure you that the measures that we take will be adequate or that we have secured  or will be able to secure  appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the united states or select foreign jurisdictions  or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect these rights  unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our curricula  online resource material and other content  and offer competing programs to ours 
in particular  third parties may attempt to develop competing programs or duplicate or copy aspects of our curriculum  online resource material  quality management and other proprietary content 
any such attempt  if successful  could adversely affect our business 
protecting these types of intellectual property rights can be difficult  particularly as it relates to the development by our competitors of competing courses and programs 
we may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property  and we may not prevail in these disputes 
third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party 
in july  we settled a dispute with another institution regarding the use of certain marks that allowed us to continue to use the marks at issue  but we may not be able to favorably resolve future disputes 
some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad  and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid those intellectual property rights 
any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit 
our general liability and cyber liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all  and we may be required to alter the content of our classes or pay monetary damages  which may be significant 
we may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions 
in some instances  our faculty members or our students may post various articles or other third party content on class discussion boards 
we may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online for class discussions 
third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material 
any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit 
our faculty members or students could also post classified material on class discussion boards  which could expose us to civil and criminal liability and harm our reputation and relationships with members of the military and government 
our general liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all  and we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages 
because we are an exclusively online provider of education  we are entirely dependent on continued growth and acceptance of exclusively online education and  if the recognition by students and employers of the value of online education does not continue to grow  our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted 
we believe that continued growth in online education will be largely dependent on additional students and employers recognizing the value of degrees from online institutions 
if students and employers are not convinced that online schools are an acceptable alternative to traditional schools or that an online education provides value  or if growth in the market penetration of exclusively online education slows  growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected 
because our business model is based on online education  if the acceptance of online education does not grow  our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we do not maintain continued strong relationships with various military bases and educational service officers  and if we are unable to expand our use of articulation agreements  our future growth may be impaired 
we have non exclusive articulation agreements or memoranda of understanding with various educational institutions of the united states armed forces and other governmental education programs 
articulation agreements and memoranda of understanding are agreements pursuant to which we agree to award academic credits toward our degrees for learning in educational programs offered by others 
additionally  we rely on relationships with educational service offices on military bases and base education officers to distribute our information to interested service members 
if our relationships with educational service offices or base education counselors deteriorate or end  our efforts to recruit students from that base will be impaired 
if our articulation agreements and memoranda of understanding are eliminated  or if our relationships with educational service offices or base education counselors deteriorate  this could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the united states armed forces has in the past and may in the future approve programs and initiatives to provide additional educational opportunities to service members  and these programs and initiatives may not include participation by us 
we cannot predict the impact of these announcements  programs or initiatives on us  but given our dependence on students from the armed forces  our net course registrations and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by such announcements  programs and initiatives 
government regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business  affect our ability to grow or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business 
the increasing popularity and use of the internet and other online services have led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the united states or foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations 
these new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy  copyrights  trademarks and service marks  sales taxes  fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence 
new laws  regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our enrollments  revenues and results of operations 
risks related to the regulation of our industry the department of education has placed us on provisional certification as a result of our recent change in ownership and control  and the terms of our provisional certification could limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment  revenues and results of operations 
in august  funds affiliated with abs capital partners reduced their beneficial ownership interest from approximately to approximately of our outstanding common stock by distributing to their limited partners and general partners  shares of our stock 
as a result of this distribution of shares  we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs 
as required under department of education regulations  we timely notified the department of education of our change in ownership and control 
in connection with the department of education s review of the change  we submitted to the department of education a change in ownership application that included the submission of required documentation  including a letter from our regional accrediting agency  the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools indicating that it had approved the change 
on october   we received a letter from the department of education approving the change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september  during a period of provisional certification  we must comply with any additional conditions included in our program participation agreement  which include  among other things  limitations on our operations 
our program participation agreement provides that as a provisionally certified institution  we must apply for and receive approval by the secretary for any substantial change 
under our program participation agreement  substantial changes include but are not limited to establishment of additional locations  an increase in the level of academic offering  and addition of any non degree or short term training program 
the department of education may also more closely review us while we are provisionally certified 
the conditions to provisional certification or closer review by the department of education could impact  among other things  our ability to add educational programs  acquire other schools or make other significant changes 
in addition  while we are provisionally certified if the department of education determines that we are unable to meet our responsibilities  it may seek to revoke our certification to participate in title iv programs with fewer due process protections than if we were fully certified 
limitations on our operations could  and the loss of our certification to participate in title iv programs would  adversely affect our ability to grow our presence outside the military sector in addition to having adverse effects on our enrollment  revenues and results of operations 
if we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our business  we could face penalties and significant restrictions on our operations  including loss of access to federal tuition assistance programs for members of the united states armed forces and federal loans and grants for our students 
we are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government through the us department of education and under the higher education act  state regulatory bodies and accrediting agencies recognized by the us secretary of education 
the regulations  standards and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations  including our educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations and financial condition 
these regulatory requirements can also affect our ability to add new or expand existing educational programs and to change our corporate structure and ownership 
institutions of higher education that grant degrees  diplomas or certificates must be authorized by an appropriate state education agency or agencies 
in addition  in certain states as a condition of continued authorization to grant degrees and in order to participate in various federal programs  including tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces  a school must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education 
accreditation is a non governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions  based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution 
the higher education act requires accrediting agencies recognized by the department of education to review and monitor many aspects of an institution s operations and to take appropriate action when the institution fails to comply with the accrediting agency s standards 
our operations are also subject to regulation due to our participation in title iv programs 
title iv programs  which are administered by the department of education  include educational loans with below market interest rates that are guaranteed by the federal government in the event of default 
title iv programs also include several grant programs for students with economic need as determined in accordance with the higher education act and department of education regulations 
to participate in title iv programs  a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies  be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education and be certified as an eligible institution by the department of education 
our growth strategy is partly dependent on enrolling more students who are attracted to us because of our continued participation in these programs 
the regulations  standards and policies of the department of education  state education agencies and our accrediting agencies change frequently  and changes in  or new interpretations of  applicable laws  regulations  standards or policies  or our noncompliance with any applicable laws  regulations  standards or policies  could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation  authorization to operate in various states  activities  receipt of funds under tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces  our ability to participate in title iv programs  or costs of doing business 
furthermore  findings of noncompliance with these laws  regulations  standards and policies also could result in our being required to pay monetary damages  or being subjected to fines  penalties  injunctions  limitations on our operations  termination of our ability to grant degrees  revocation of our accreditation  restrictions on our access to title iv program funds or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation  we would lose our ability to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces and also to participate in title iv programs 
american public university system is accredited by the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools  one of six regional accrediting agencies recognized by the secretary of education  and by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council  or detc  which is a national accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education 
accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education is required for participation in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces 
in  we derived approximately of our net course registrations from these tuition assistance programs 
accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education for title iv purposes is also required for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in title iv programs 
american public university system achieved regional accreditation from the higher learning commission in and has had national accreditation from the distance education and training council since we have identified the higher learning commission as our primary accreditor for title iv purposes 
either the higher learning commission or detc may impose restrictions on our accreditation or may terminate our accreditation 
to remain accredited american public university system must continuously meet certain criteria and standards relating to  among other things  performance  governance  institutional integrity  educational quality  faculty  administrative capability  resources and financial stability 
failure to meet any of these criteria or standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of the accrediting agencies 
furthermore  many prospective students may view accreditation by a regional accrediting agency to be more prestigious than accreditation by a national accrediting agency  and we believe that loss of regional accreditation may reduce the marketability of american public university system even if national accreditation were maintained 
the complete loss of accreditation would  among other things  render our students and us ineligible to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces or title iv programs and have a material adverse effect on our enrollments  revenues and results of operations 
we have only recently begun to participate in title iv programs  and our failure to comply with the complex regulations associated with title iv programs would have a significant adverse effect on our operations and prospects for growth 
we first became certified to participate in title iv programs for classes beginning in november we expect a significant portion of our growth in enrollments and revenues to come from students who are utilizing funds from title iv programs 
however  compliance with the requirements of the higher education act and title iv programs is highly complex and imposes significant additional regulatory requirements on our operations  which require additional staff  contractual arrangements  systems and regulatory costs 
we have limited to no demonstrated history of compliance with these additional regulatory requirements 
if we fail to comply with any of these additional regulatory requirements  the department of education could  among other things  impose monetary penalties  place limitations on our operations  and or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds  which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment  revenues and results of operations 
if american public university system does not maintain its authorization in west virginia  our operations would be curtailed and we may not grant degrees 
a school that grants degrees  diplomas or certificates must be authorized by the relevant education agency of the state or states in which it is located 
state authorization is also required for an institution to be eligible to participate in title iv programs 
american public university system is headquartered in the state of west virginia and is authorized by the west virginia higher education policy commission 
if we maintain our regional accreditation  we will likely remain in good standing with the west virginia higher education policy commission 
however  the west virginia higher education policy commission may also take disciplinary action or revoke authorization if an institution s bond is cancelled  if the institution fails to take corrective action to bring it into compliance with west virginia higher education policy commission policies  or if the owner is convicted for a felony or crime involving institution administration of title iv programs 
if we do not maintain regional accreditation  our state authorization may be continued based on our national accrediting agency  detc  if the west virginia higher education policy commission finds that it is an acceptable alternative accrediting agency 
if we lose accreditation from both accrediting agencies  or accreditation by detc is not an acceptable alternative accrediting agency in case of loss of higher learning commission accreditation  the west virginia higher education policy commission may suspend  withdraw  or revoke our authorization 
in addition  in order to maintain our eligibility for accreditation by the higher learning commission  we must remain headquartered in one of the states in its region  which includes west virginia 
if we were to lose our authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission we would be unable to provide educational services  and we would lose our regional accreditation 
our failure to comply with regulations of various states could have a material adverse effect on our enrollments  revenues and results of operations 
various states impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries 
several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but offer educational services to students who reside in the state  or that advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state 
state regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent among states and not well developed in many jurisdictions 
as such  these requirements change frequently and  in some instances  are not clear or are left to the discretion of state regulators 
our changing business and the constantly changing regulatory environment require us to evaluate continually our state regulatory compliance activities 
in the event we are found not to be in compliance  and a state seeks to restrict one or more of our business activities within its boundaries  we may not be able to recruit students from that state and may have to cease providing service to students in that state 
american public university system has a physical presence in the commonwealth of virginia based on administrative offices in that state  and it is authorized by the state council of higher education for virginia 
we are currently reviewing the licensure requirements of other states to determine whether our activities in these states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization by the respective state education agencies  and we have  and are in the process of seeking  licensure or authorization in additional states 
state laws typically establish standards for instruction  qualifications of faculty  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations and other operational matters 
to the extent that we have obtained  or obtain in the future  additional authorizations or licensure  state laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and award degrees 
some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the department of education  the west virginia higher education policy commission  the higher learning commission or detc 
if we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements  we may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization 
if we fail to comply with state requirements to obtain licensure or authorization  we may be the subject of injunctive actions or penalties 
although we believe that the only state licensure or authorization that is necessary for american public university system to participate in the tuition assistance programs for the united states armed forces and in title iv programs is our authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission  loss of licensure or authorization in other states or the failure to obtain required licensures or authorizations could prohibit us from recruiting or enrolling students in those states  reduce significantly our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we must periodically seek recertification to participate in title iv programs  and may  in certain circumstances  be subject to review by the department of education prior to seeking recertification  and our future success may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification 
an institution generally must seek recertification from the department of education at least every six years and possibly more frequently depending on various factors  such as whether it is provisionally certified 
the department of education may also review an institution s continued eligibility and certification to participate in title iv programs  or scope of eligibility and certification  in the event the institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control or expands its activities in certain ways  such as the addition of certain types of new programs  or  in certain cases  changes to the academic credentials that it offers 
in certain circumstances  the department of education must provisionally certify an institution  such as when it is an initial participant in title iv programs or has undergone a change in ownership and control 
in we applied to participate in title iv programs for the first time and were provisionally certified for a period through june  we timely submitted our application for recertification  and the department of education granted us provisional certification through june  in may  we were fully recertified to participate in title iv programs 
in august  we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs 
as required under department of education regulations  we timely notified the department of education of our change in ownership and control 
in connection with the department of education s review of the change  we submitted to the department of education a change in ownership application that included the submission of required documentation  including a letter from the higher learning commission indicating that it had approved the change 
on october   we received a letter from the department of education approving the change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september  a provisionally certified institution must apply for and receive department of education approval of substantial changes and must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement 
if the department of education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement  it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in title iv programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified 
the department of education may withdraw our certification if it determines that we are not fulfilling material requirements for continued participation in title iv programs 
if the department of education does not renew or withdraws our certification to participate in title iv programs  our students would no longer be able to receive title iv program funds  which would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments  revenues and results of operations 
in addition  regulatory restraints related to the addition of new programs could impair our ability to attract and retain students and could negatively affect our financial results 
if regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company  our ability to operate could be impaired 
if we or american public university system experience a change of control under the standards of applicable state education agencies  the department of education  detc  the higher learning commission  or other regulators  we must notify or seek the approval of each relevant regulatory agency 
a change of control occurred in august and we have completed the required notification and approval processes 
as a result of its review and approval of the change  the higher learning commission informed us that it plans to conduct a focused evaluation in spring as its policies require it to do as a result of a change of the type we experienced in august transactions or events that constitute a change of control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution s common stock and significant changes in the composition of an institution s board of directors 
some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control 
our failure to obtain  or a delay in receiving  approval of any change of control from the west virginia higher education policy commission  the state council of higher education for virginia  the department of education  detc or the higher learning commission could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our failure to obtain  or a delay in receiving  approval of any change of control from other states in which we are currently licensed or authorized could require us to suspend our activities in that state or otherwise impair our operations 
the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale  purchase  transfer  issuance or redemption of our stock 
in addition  the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could have an adverse effect on the market price of your shares 
government and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews  bring claims or initiate litigation against us  any of which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our performance 
because we operate in a highly regulated industry  we are subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies  regulatory agencies and third parties  including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government 
for example  the department of education regularly conducts program reviews of educational institutions that are participating in the title iv programs and the office of inspector general of the department of education regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions 
if the results of compliance reviews or other proceedings are unfavorable to us  or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims  we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines  limitations  loss of title iv funding  injunctions or other penalties  including the requirement to make refunds 
even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim  we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims 
claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation  even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit 
our regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for profit institutions 
we are one of a number of for profit institutions serving the postsecondary education market 
in recent years  regulatory investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several companies that own for profit educational institutions 
these investigations and lawsuits have alleged  among other things  deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with department of education regulations 
these allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings 
although the media  regulatory and legislative focus has been primarily on the allegations made against these specific companies  broader allegations against the overall for profit school sector may negatively affect public perceptions of other for profit educational institutions  including american public university system 
in addition  recent reports on student lending practices of various lending institutions and schools  including for profit schools  and investigations by a number of state attorneys general  congress and governmental agencies have led to adverse media coverage of postsecondary education 
adverse media coverage regarding other companies in the for profit school sector or regarding us directly could damage our reputation  could result in lower enrollments  revenues and operating profit  and could have a negative impact on our stock price 
such allegations could also result in increased scrutiny and regulation by the department of education  congress  accrediting bodies  state legislatures or other governmental authorities with respect to all for profit institutions  including us 
congress may change the law or reduce funding for title iv programs  which could reduce our student population  revenues and profit margin 
the higher education act comes up for reauthorization by congress approximately every five to six years 
when congress does not act on complete reauthorization  there are typically amendments and extensions of authorization 
on august   president bush signed into law the higher education opportunity act  or heoa  which reauthorizes the higher education act 
additionally  congress reviews and determines appropriations for title iv programs on an annual basis through the budget and appropriations process 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect heoa will have on our business 
further  many of the provisions of heoa are effective upon enactment  even though the department of education has not yet promulgated regulations related to such provisions 
if our efforts to comply with the provisions of heoa are inconsistent with how the department of education interprets those provisions in final regulations or otherwise  we may be found to be in noncompliance with such provisions and the department of education could impose monetary penalties  place limitations on our operations  and or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds 
in addition  there is no assurance that congress will not in the future enact changes that decrease title iv program funds available to students  including students who attend our institution 
any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for title iv programs or the ability of our school or students to participate in these programs  would require us to arrange for other sources of financial aid and would materially decrease our enrollment 
such a decrease in enrollment would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
congressional action  including heoa  may also require us to modify our practices in ways that could result in increased administrative and regulatory costs and decreased profit margin 
further  president bush signed three major laws that amend the higher education act 
among other measures  those laws reauthorize the federal student loan programs  reduce interest rates on certain federal student loans  reduce government subsidies to lenders that participate in federal student loan programs  and seek to facilitate student loan availability in light of current market conditions 
we are not in a position to predict with certainty whether any legislation will be passed by congress or signed into law in the future 
the reallocation of funding among title iv programs  material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs  or the substitution of materially different title iv programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institution and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
investigations by state attorneys general  congress and governmental agencies regarding relationships between loan providers and educational institutions and their financial aid officers may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs 
in recent years  the student lending practices of postsecondary educational institutions  financial aid officers and student loan providers have been subjected to several investigations by state attorneys general  congress and governmental agencies 
these investigations concern  among other things  possible deceptive practices in the marketing of private student loans and loans provided by lenders pursuant to title iv programs 
heoa contains new requirements pertinent to relationships between lenders and institutions 
in particular  heoa requires institutions to have a code of conduct  with certain specified provisions  pertinent to interactions with lenders of student loans  prohibits certain activities by lenders and guaranty agencies with respect to institutions  and establishes substantive and disclosure requirements for lists of recommended or suggested lenders of federal and private student loans 
in addition  heoa imposes substantive and disclosure obligations on institutions that make available a list of recommended lenders for potential borrowers 
the department of education recently promulgated regulations  generally effective july   that in part address institutions student loan activity 
in particular  the department of education s regulations clarify and expand rules pertinent to relationships between institutions and lenders and establish new rules applicable to institutions that make available a list of recommended or suggested lenders for use by potential borrowers 
state legislators have also passed or may be considering legislation related to relationships between lenders and institutions 
because of the evolving nature of these legislative efforts and various inquiries and developments  we can neither know nor predict with certainty their outcome or effects  or the potential remedial actions that might result from these or other potential inquiries 
governmental action may impose increased administrative and regulatory costs and decreased profit margins 
we are subject to sanctions that could be material to our results and damage our reputation if we fail to calculate correctly and return timely title iv program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program 
a school participating in title iv programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned title iv program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner  generally within days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn 
because we began to participate in title iv programs in  we have limited experience complying with these provisions 
under department of education regulations  late returns of title iv program funds for or more of students sampled in connection with the institution s annual compliance audit constitutes material noncompliance 
if unearned funds are not properly calculated and timely returned  we may have to repay title iv funds  post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education or otherwise be sanctioned by the department of education  which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our results of operations 
a failure to demonstrate financial responsibility may result in the loss of eligibility by american public university system to participate in title iv programs or require the posting of a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
to participate in title iv programs  an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the department of education  or post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education and possibly accept other conditions  such as provisional certification  additional reporting requirements or regulatory oversight  on its participation in title iv programs 
the department of education may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution and  if such measures are not satisfied by the operating company or ownership entities  require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in title iv programs 
any obligation to post a letter of credit could increase our costs of regulatory compliance 
if we were unable to secure a letter of credit  we would lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
in addition to the obligation to post a letter of credit under certain circumstances  an institution that is determined by the department of education not to be financially responsible may be transferred from the advance system of payment of title iv funds  which allows the institution to obtain title iv program funds from the department of education prior to making disbursements to students  to cash monitoring status or to the reimbursement system of payment  which requires the institution to make title iv disbursements to students and seek reimbursement from the department of education 
a change in our system of payment could increase our costs of regulatory compliance 
if we fail to demonstrate financial responsibility and thus lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs  our students would lose access to title iv program funds for use in our institution  which would limit our potential for growth outside the military community and adversely affect our enrollment  revenues and results of operations 
a failure to demonstrate administrative capability may result in the loss of american public university system s eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
department of education regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in title iv programs 
see regulation of our business in this annual report for more information on the department of education s regulations on administrative capability 
if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other department of education regulations  the department of education may require the repayment of title iv funds  transfer the institution from the advance system of payment of title iv funds to cash monitoring status or to the reimbursement system of payment  place the institution on provisional certification status  or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit  suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in title iv programs 
if we are found not to have satisfied the department of education s administrative capability requirements we could be limited in our access to  or lose  title iv program funding  which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment  revenues and results of operations 
we rely on a third party to administer our participation in title iv programs and its failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
we only recently became eligible to participate in title iv programs  and we have not developed the internal capacity to handle without third party assistance the complex administration of participation in title iv programs 
global financial aid services  inc assists us with administration of our participation in title iv programs  and if it does not comply with applicable regulations  we may be liable for its actions and we could lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
in addition  if it is no longer able to provide the services to us  we may not be able to replace it in a timely or cost efficient manner  or at all  and we could lose our ability to comply with the requirements of title iv programs  which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment  revenues and results of operation 
we are subject to sanctions if we pay impermissible commissions  bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals involved in recruiting  admissions or financial aid activities 
a school participating in title iv programs may not provide any commission  bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in enrolling students or securing financial aid to any person involved in student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of title iv program funds 
the law and regulations governing this requirement do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances 
if we violate this law  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by the department of education  or we could face litigation brought under the whistleblower provisions of the federal false claims act 
any such fines or sanctions could harm our reputation  impose significant costs on us  and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may lose eligibility to participate in title iv programs if our student loan default rates are too high  and if we lose that eligibility our future growth could be impaired 
an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs if  for three consecutive federal fiscal years  or more of its students who were required to begin repaying their student loans in the relevant fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next federal fiscal year 
in addition  an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs if its default rate exceeds in the most recent federal fiscal year for which default rates have been calculated by the department of education 
heoa modifies the higher education act s default rate provisions 
beginning with default rate calculations for federal fiscal year  the cohort default rate will be calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in the relevant federal fiscal year default by the end of the second following federal fiscal year 
the current method of calculating rates will remain in effect and will be used to determine institutional eligibility until three consecutive years of cohort default rates calculated under the new formula are available 
in addition  effective as of federal fiscal year  the cohort default rate threshold of will be increased to 
heoa also requires certain default prevention action by an institution with a default rate of or more 
because we have begun only recently to enroll students who are participating in these federal student loan programs  we have no historical cohort default rates 
relatively few students are expected to enter the repayment phase in the near term  which could result in defaults by a few students having a relatively large impact on our cohort default rate 
if american public university system loses its eligibility to participate in title iv programs because of high student loan default rates  our students would no longer be eligible to use title iv program funds in our institution  which would significantly reduce our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
risks related to owning our common stock the price of our common stock may be volatile  and as a result returns on an investment in our common stock may be volatile 
we completed our initial public offering in november for a significant portion of the time since our initial public offering  we have had relatively limited public float  and trading in our common stock has also been limited and  at times  volatile 
an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained  and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially 
the price of the common stock may fluctuate as a result of price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings  enrollments or net course registrations  or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts  the actual  anticipated or perceived impact of changes in government policies  laws and regulations  or similar changes made by accrediting bodies  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  general economic conditions and trends  catastrophic events  sales of large blocks of our stock  or recruitment or departure of key personnel 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
because of the potential volatility of our stock price  we may become the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business 
we are incurring significant costs as a result of operating as a public company that we have not previously incurred  and our management and key employees are  and will continue to be  required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives 
we have operated as a public company only since november  as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of and rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market have imposed various new requirements on public companies  including with respect to public disclosure  internal control  corporate governance practices and other matters 
our management and other personnel are devoting substantial amounts of time to these new compliance initiatives 
moreover  these rules and regulations have significantly increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time consuming and costly 
in addition  we have and will continue to incur additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements 
we will incur significant costs to remediate any material weaknesses we identify through these efforts 
these rules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
we currently are evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules  and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
if our profitability is adversely affected because of these additional costs  it could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
seasonal and other fluctuations in our results of operations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our results in any quarter may not indicate the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or for the full year 
our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to changes in enrollment 
student population varies as a result of new enrollments  graduations and student attrition 
while our number of enrolled students has grown in each sequential quarter over the past three years  the number of enrolled students has been proportionally greatest in the fourth quarter of each respective year 
a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses do not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of new program introductions and increased enrollments of students 
these fluctuations may result in volatility in our results of operations and or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
if we fail to maintain proper and effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting  our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired  which could adversely affect our stock price  our ability to operate our business and investors views of us 
ensuring that we have adequate disclosure controls and procedures  including internal controls over financial reporting  in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time consuming effort that needs to be re evaluated frequently 
we are continuing the process of documenting  reviewing and  if appropriate  improving our internal controls and procedures following our becoming a public company and we have just become subject to the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act for the first time for the year ended december  section requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could lead to a lack of confidence by investors in our reported results  a decline in our stock price and significant costs to remediate the situation 
if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade their evaluations of our stock  the price of our stock could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of the analysts covering us downgrade their estimates or evaluations of our stock  the price of our stock could decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market for our stock  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
provisions in our organizational documents and in the delaware general corporation law may prevent takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our charter and bylaws and in the delaware general corporation law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover attempt we oppose even if a change in control of our company would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders 
these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers  preferences and rights of each series without stockholder approval  which may discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our company  a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of their intention to nominate a director or to propose any other business at an annual meeting of stockholders  a prohibition against stockholder action by means of written consent unless otherwise approved by our board of directors in advance  and the application of section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own or more of our voting stock  or with their affiliates  unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner 
however  because funds affiliated with abs capital partners acquired their shares prior to our initial public offering  section is currently inapplicable to any business combination or transaction with it or its affiliates

overview american public education  inc is a provider of online postsecondary education directed at the needs of the military and public service communities 
we operate through two universities  american military university  or amu  and american public university  or apu  which together constitute the american public university system 
our course enrollments  or net course registrations  representing the aggregate number of classes in which students remain enrolled after the date by which they may drop the course without financial penalty  increased at a compound annual growth rate cagr of from to over that same time  total revenue increased at a cagr of  from million in to million in we believe achieving regional accreditation in may and gaining access to title iv programs beginning with classes that started in november have been additional factors driving growth 
net course registrations increased by in over  our revenue increased from million to million  or by  over the same time period and operating margins increased to from over the same time period 
net course registrations increased by in over  our revenue increased from million to million  or by  over the same time period and operating margins increased to from over the same time period 
while we have experienced substantial growth in recent periods  you should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of our future growth in net course registrations or revenue as we do not expect that our historical growth rates are sustainable 
similarly  you should not rely on the improvement in our operating margins in any prior periods as an indication of our future operating margins 
you should also note that our rates of growth in net course registrations  revenues and earnings from to were all lower than our rate of growth from to we do not expect to return to the levels of growth that we had from to  when we had a particularly strong growth rate  which we think is largely as a result of our receipt of regional accreditation in late our difficulty in forecasting future growth rates and operating margins is in part due to our inability to fully estimate the actual impact of gaining access to title iv programs 
we first became eligible to use title iv funds beginning with classes that started in november for the year ended december   of our net course registrations were from students using financial aid under title iv programs 
because of our limited history with title iv programs and because we cannot estimate the growth of new students that may result from our participation in title iv programs  estimating the costs and expenses associated with administering title iv programs and complying with the associated regulations is difficult 
we were founded as american military university  inc in and began offering graduate courses in january following initial national accreditation by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council  or detc  in  american military university began offering undergraduate programs primarily directed to members of the armed forces 
over time  american military university diversified its educational offerings in response to demand by military students for post military career preparation 
with its expanded program offerings  american military university extended its outreach to the greater public service community  primarily police  fire  emergency management personnel and national security professionals 
in  we reorganized into a holding company structure  with american public education  inc serving as the holding company of american public university system which operates our two universities  amu and apu 
our university system achieved regional accreditation in may with the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools and became eligible for federal student aid programs under title iv for classes beginning in november in september  we received approval from the higher learning commission to offer seven new degree programs in education and information technology 
our key financial results metrics revenues in reviewing our revenues we consider the following components net course registrations  tuition we charge  tuition net of scholarships  and other fees 
net course registrations 
for financial reporting and analysis purposes  we measure our student body in terms of aggregate course enrollments  or net course registrations 
net course registrations represent the aggregate number of classes in which students remain enrolled after the date by which they may drop the course without financial penalty 
because we recognize revenues over the length of a course  net course registrations in a period do not correlate directly with revenues for that period because revenues recognized from courses are not necessarily recognized in the period in which the course registrations occur 
for example  revenues in a quarter reflect a portion of the revenue from courses that began in a prior period and continued into the quarter  all revenue from courses that began and ended in the quarter  and a portion of the revenue from courses that began but did not end in the quarter 
we believe our curriculum is directly relevant to federal  state and local law enforcement and other first responders  but historically this market was limited to us because  outside the federal government  only a few agencies or departments have the tuition reimbursement plans critical to fund continuing adult education 
now that our students can obtain low cost student loans or grants through title iv programs  we have begun to increase our focus on these markets 
title iv programs require participating students to take more courses per semester than students participating in department of defense  or dod  tuition assistance programs 
as a result  we expect that our increased focus on markets that utilize title iv programs may cause the average number of courses per student to increase 
tuition 
providing affordable programs is an important element of our strategy for growth 
other than a modest increase in for graduate tuition  we have not raised tuition since we set our tuition costs so that our undergraduate military students may take courses without incurring out of pocket costs because our tuition is within the dod tuition ceilings 
using the dod tuition ceiling as a benchmark keeps our tuition in line with four year public university  in state rates 
net tuition 
tuition revenues vary from period to period based on the aggregate number of students attending classes and the number of classes they are attending during the period 
tuition revenue is reduced to reflect amounts refunded to students who withdraw from a course in the month the withdrawal occurs 
we also provide scholarships to certain students to assist them financially and to promote their registration 
the cost of these scholarships is netted against tuition revenue in the period incurred for purposes of establishing net tuition revenue and typically represents less than of revenues 
other fees 
other fees include charges for transcript credit evaluation  which includes assistance in securing official transcripts on behalf of the student in addition to evaluating transcripts for transfer credit 
students also are charged withdrawal  graduation  late registration  transcript request and comprehensive examination fees  when applicable 
in accordance with emerging issues tasks force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  other fees also includes book purchase commissions we receive for graduate student book purchases and ancillary supply purchases students make directly from our preferred book vendor 
costs and expenses we categorize our costs and expenses as i instructional costs and services  ii selling and promotional  iii general and administrative  and iv depreciation and amortization 
instructional costs and services 
instructional costs and services are expenses directly attributable to the educational services we provide our students 
this expense category includes salaries and benefits for full time faculty  administrators and academic advisors  and costs associated with adjunct faculty 
instructional pay for adjunct faculty is primarily dependent on the number of students taught 
instructional costs and services expenses also include costs for educational supplies such as books  costs associated with academic records and graduation  and other university services such as evaluating transcripts 
substantially all undergraduate students receive their textbooks through our book grant program 
over the course of a complete bachelor s degree program  this represents a potential average student savings of approximately  when compared to a estimate by the general accounting office of average textbook costs for a first time  full time student at four year public universities for the academic year 
in connection with our book grant program  we have been working to reduce the overall cost of books per course 
graduate students may order and pay for their books through the contracted vendor from which we purchase the undergraduate book grant program books or they can purchase books from a vendor of their choice 
selling and promotional 
selling and promotional expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in recruitment and promotion  as well as costs associated with advertising and the production of marketing materials related to new enrollments and current students 
our selling and promotional expenses are generally affected by the cost of advertising media  the efficiency of our selling efforts  salaries and benefits for our selling and admissions personnel  and the number of advertising initiatives for new and existing academic programs 
we believe that the availability of federal student aid programs to our students should increase our marketability in non military markets  but we anticipate that the more competitive nature of these markets may cause our student acquisition costs to increase in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees engaged in corporate management  finance  information technology  human resources  facilities  compliance and other corporate functions 
in addition  the cost of renting and maintaining our facilities  technology expenses and costs for professional services are included in general and administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization 
we incur depreciation and amortization expenses for costs related to the capitalization of property  equipment  software and program development on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
interest income  net interest income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents  net of any interest expense 
changes in connection with becoming a public company as a public company  we have begun and will continue to incur significant additional costs and expenses such as increased legal and audit fees  professional fees  directors and officers insurance costs and expenses related to compliance with sarbanes oxley act regulations and other annual costs of doing business as a public company including hiring additional personnel and expanding our administrative functions 
we expect these additional expenses will continue to range from million to million per year and anticipate funding costs relating to being a public company with cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand 
a significant portion of the costs and expenses in related to our preparation for our first year subject to section of the sarbanes oxley act  and we expect those costs to be lower in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  contingencies  income taxes and stock based compensation expense 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of our critical accounting policies follows revenue recognition 
we record all tuition as deferred revenue when students begin a class 
at the beginning of each class  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the period of the class  which is either eight or sixteen weeks 
this results in our balance sheet including future revenues that have not yet been earned as deferred revenue for classes that are in progress 
students who request to be placed on program hold are required to complete or withdraw from the courses prior to being placed on hold 
other revenue includes charges for transcript credit evaluation  which includes assistance in securing official transcripts on behalf of the student in addition to evaluating transcripts for transfer credit 
students also are charged withdrawal  graduation  late registration  transcript request and comprehensive examination fees  when applicable 
in accordance with emerging issues tasks force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  other fees also includes book purchase commissions we receive for graduate student book purchases and ancillary supply purchases students make directly from our preferred book vendor 
tuition revenues vary from period to period based on the number of net course registrations 
students may remit tuition payments through the online registration process at any time or they may elect various payment options  including payments by sponsors  alternative loans  financial aid  or the dod tuition assistance program that remits payments directly to us 
these other payment options can delay the receipt of payment up until the class starts or longer  resulting in the recording of a receivable from the student and deferred revenue at the beginning of each session 
tuition revenue for sessions in progress that has not been yet earned by us  is presented as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet 
accounts receivable 
course registrations are recorded as deferred revenue and accounts receivable at the time students begin a course 
students may remit tuition payments through the online registration process at any time or they may elect various payment options  which can delay the receipt of payment up until the class starts or longer 
these other payment options include payments by sponsors  alternative loans  financial aid  or a tuition assistance program that remits payments directly to us 
when a student remits payment after a class has begun  accounts receivable is reduced 
if payment is made prior to the start of class  the payment is recorded as a student deposit and the student is provided access to the classroom when classes start 
if one of the various other payment options are confirmed as secured  the student is provided access to the classroom 
if no receipt is confirmed or payment option secured  the student will be dropped from the class 
therefore  billed amounts represent invoices that have been prepared and sent to students or their sponsor  lender  financial aid  or tuition assistance program according to the billing terms agreed upon in advance 
the dod tuition assistance program is billed on a course by course basis when a student starts class  whereas federal financial aid programs are billed based on the classes included in a student s semester 
billed accounts receivable are considered past due if the invoice has been outstanding more than days 
the provision for doubtful accounts is based on management s evaluation of the status of existing accounts receivable 
recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
assets acquired under capital leases are recorded at the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease 
depreciation and amortization are calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
our partnership at a distance  or pad  is a customized student information and services system  that manages admissions  online orientation  course registrations  tuition payments  grade reporting  progress toward degrees  and various other functions 
costs associated with the project have been capitalized in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and classified as property and equipment 
these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of five years 
the company capitalizes the costs for program development 
costs are transferred to property and equipment upon completion of each program and amortized over an estimated life not to exceed three years 
valuation of long lived assets 
we account for the valuation of long lived assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the long lived asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reportable at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
we account for the valuation of long lived assets with intangible lives that are not subject to amortization under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that an intangible asset that is not subject to amortization to be tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test shall consist of comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized pursuant to step two of the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are determined using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
as those differences reverse  they will enter into the determination of future taxable income 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options 
fas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using the footnote disclosure only provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and instead requires that such transactions be recognized and reflected in our financial statements using a fair value based method 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  relating to fas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of fas r 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock option awards on the date of grant 
our determination of the fair value of these stock option awards was affected by the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
we calculate the expected term of stock option awards using the simplified method as defined by staff accounting bulleting no 
and because we lack historical data and are unable to make reasonable expectations regarding the future 
we also estimate forfeitures of share based awards at the time of grant and revise such estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from original projections 
we make assumptions with respect to expected stock price volatility based on the average historical volatility of peers with similar attributes 
in addition  we determine the risk free interest rate by selecting the us treasury five year constant maturity  quoted on an investment basis in effect at the time of grant for that business day 
estimates of fair value are subjective and are not intended to predict actual future events  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made under fas r 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

fsp and fsp are effective for the company on january  in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revised  business combinations sfas r 
the statement establishes revised principles and requirements for how the company will recognize and measure assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination 
the statement is effective for business combinations completed on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  in addition  in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas requires non controlling interests or minority interests to be treated as a separate component of equity and any changes in the parent s ownership interest in which control is retained are to be accounted for as equity transactions 
however  a change in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary that results in deconsolidation triggers gain or loss recognition  with the establishment of a new fair value basis in any remaining non controlling ownership interests 
sfas also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the non controlling interests 
sfas r and are effective for us on january  the adoption of the above standards is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements

this decrease in costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues and increase in operating margins resulted from the factors described below 
overall  our costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue declined due to the proportionately higher growth in revenues as compared with the growth in expenses 
instructional costs and services 
instructional costs and services expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of from million for the year ended december  this increase was directly related to an increase in the number of classes offered due to the increase in net course registrations

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to efficiencies realized through a higher volume of students and the number of staff and expenses increasing at a slower rate than revenue 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of 
this increase resulted from greater capital expenditures and higher depreciation and amortization on a larger fixed asset base 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation included in instructional costs and services  selling and promotional and general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million in the aggregate  representing an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increase in stock based compensation expense is primarily attributable to an increase in new stock option grants
