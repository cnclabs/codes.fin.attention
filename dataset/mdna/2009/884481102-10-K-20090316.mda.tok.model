ii part i item business overview we are an investment bank focused principally on growth companies and growth investors 
on february   thomas weisel partners group  inc twpg  a delaware corporation  succeeded to the business of thomas weisel partners group llc and completed an initial public offering of its common stock 
our business is managed as a single operating segment  and we generate revenues by providing financial services that include investment banking  brokerage  research and asset management 
we take a comprehensive approach in providing these services to growth companies 
in january  we completed our acquisition of westwind capital corporation  an independent  institutional investment bank focused on growth companies and growth investors  particularly in the energy and mining sectors 
we have offices in the following locations united states canada baltimore toronto boston calgary chicago cleveland europe denver london new york zurich portland san francisco silicon valley we are exposed to volatility and trends in the general securities market and the economy  and we are currently facing difficult market and economic conditions 
due to these conditions  we have experienced a significant decrease in client activity levels that have resulted in  among other things  lower overall investment banking activity 
it is difficult to predict when conditions will change 
notwithstanding the exposure to volatility and trends and the current difficult economic conditions  in order to provide value to our clients  we have made a long term commitment to maintaining a substantial  full service integrated business platform 
as a result of this commitment  if business conditions result in decreases to our revenues  we may not experience corresponding decreases in the expense of operating our business 
principal business lines our business is organized into four service offerings investment banking  brokerage  equity research and asset management 
investment banking our investment bankers provide two primary categories of services i corporate finance and ii strategic advisory 
our corporate finance practice is comprised of industry coverage groups that are dedicated to establishing long term relationships and executing a broad range of capital raising transactions 
our strategic advisory practice focuses on developing tailored solutions to meet client goals and objectives through industry expertise  transaction experience and corporate relationships with leading growth companies 
in addition  through our commitment to providing senior level attention  we focus on building and maintaining long term strategic advisory relationships with growth companies 
we take a lifecycle approach to servicing growth companies 
we combine our industry knowledge base with our corporate  venture capital and professional relationships to identify leading growth companies for our services 
the execution capabilities of our investment banking professionals enable us to provide these companies with a full range of investment banking services  including equity and debt securities offerings and strategic advisory services throughout their lifecycle as they engage in more complex capital markets and strategic transactions 
corporate finance 
our corporate finance practice advises on and structures capital raising solutions for our corporate clients through public and private offerings of equity and debt securities  including convertible debt 
we offer a wide range of financial services designed to meet the needs of growth companies  including initial public offerings  follow on and secondary offerings  equity linked offerings  private investments in public equity and private placements of both debt and equity securities 
within corporate finance  our capital markets group executes a variety of transactions  both public underwritten securities offerings and private offerings  assists clients with investor relations advice and introduces companies seeking to raise capital to investors that we believe will be supportive long term investors 
we assist the efforts of our corporate finance practice by providing aftermarket trading support for our corporate finance clients

our strategic advisory services include general strategic advice as well as transaction specific advice regarding mergers and acquisitions  divestitures  spin offs  privatizations  special committee assignments and takeover defenses 
our specialized advisory professionals work in conjunction with our industry coverage groups in advising our corporate clients 
we seek to become a trusted advisor to the leading growth companies and to achieve a balance between our buy and sell side assignments 
our buy and sell side assignments are generated through our network of business relationships and by our reputation for quality execution 
our strategic advisory services are also supported by our capital markets professionals  who provide assistance in acquisition financing and market intelligence in connection with mergers and acquisitions transactions 
brokerage we provide two principal categories of services within our brokerage operations i institutional brokerage  which comprises institutional sales  sales trading  trading and special situations and ii private client services 
institutional brokerage 
we provide equity and convertible debt securities sales and trading services to more than  institutional investors 
institutional sales 
our institutional sales professionals provide equity and convertible debt securities sales services to institutional investors and seek to develop strong relationships with the portfolio managers they serve by developing expertise and working closely with our equity research department 
our institutional sales professionals focus on growth companies identified by our equity research department and seek to develop a thorough understanding of those companies

non deal road shows 
we work to leverage our industry knowledge and relationships by helping our institutional clients maintain and build corporate contacts through coordinating company and investor meetings that are unrelated to planned or pending investment banking transactions  commonly referred to as non deal road shows 
we believe these non deal road shows underscore our high service approach  promote our brokerage services and are valued by our institutional brokerage clients

we use these specialized events to showcase companies to institutional investors focused on investing in these growth sectors 
we believe that our conferences differentiate us from smaller investment banks that may lack the relationships and resources to host broadly attended industry events 
asset management our asset management division is divided into three principal units i private investment funds  ii public equity investment products and iii distribution management 
private investment funds 
we are currently the managing general partner of three groups of investment funds thomas weisel global growth partners is a fund of funds for private fund investments with a capital commitment of million in a fund for secondary private equity investments with a capital commitment of million was formed in and a third fund for private equity investments with a capital commitment of million was formed in as of december   the total amount that has been invested by these funds was million

the fund was formed in with a capital commitment of million  million of which has been invested as of december  thomas weisel venture partners is a venture capital fund that invests in information technology companies  particularly in the broadly defined software and communications industries 
the fund was formed in with a capital commitment of approximately million  million of which has been invested as of december  as manager of these funds  we receive management fees generally based on committed capital or net assets of the partnerships 
in the future we expect to continue to sponsor and raise follow on or new investment funds 
in december  thomas weisel capital management llc twcm  a subsidiary of twpg  completed a transaction with guggenheim partners  llc in which an affiliate of guggenheim became the managing general partner of thomas weisel india opportunity fund lp  and thomas weisel india opportunity llc  a subsidiary of twcm  became the non managing special limited partner 
public equity investment products 
we have a small mid cap growth public equity investment team based in portland  oregon 
we have provided approximately million of seed investment capital for the products they manage 
this public equity investment team manages these products through an asset management subsidiary and collectively is entitled to receive approximately of the profits generated 
in the future  we expect to continue to expand our asset management business and provide additional seed investment capital for new asset management products 
distribution management 
distribution management actively manages securities distributions from private equity and venture capital funds 
we seek to enhance the returns realized by distributions made from private equity and venture capital funds 
the distribution management services we provide include dedicated portfolio management  execution  consolidated reporting and administrative support 
employees at december   we had approximately employees 
in  we reduced our headcount by approximately employees  net  and as of march   we now have approximately employees 
our professionals draw upon their experience and market expertise to provide differentiated advice and customized services to our clients 
we believe our professionals are attracted to our company by our specialized market focus  entrepreneurial culture and commitment to our clients 
none of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and believe our relationship with our employees to be good 
competition as an investment bank  all aspects of our business are intensely competitive 
our competitors are investment banking firms  other brokerage firms  merchant banks and financial advisory firms 
we compete with some of our competitors nationally or regionally and with others on a product or service basis 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital and resources than we do and offer a broader range of financial products 
we believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our business include client relationships  reputation  the abilities of our professionals  market focus and the relative quality and price of our services and products 
in recent years there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry 
legislative and regulatory changes in the united states have allowed commercial banks to enter businesses previously limited to investment banks  and a number of large commercial banks  insurance companies and other broad based financial services firms have established or acquired broker dealers or merged with other financial institutions 
this trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of many of our competitors 
many of our competitors have the ability to offer a wider range of products and services that may enhance their competitive position 
they may also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products and services with commercial banking  insurance and other financial services capabilities in an effort to gain market share  which could result in pricing pressure in our businesses 
we experience price competition with respect to our investment banking business 
one trend  particularly in the equity underwriting business  toward multiple book runners and co managers has increased the competitive pressure in the investment banking industry and may lead to lower average transaction fees 
we also experience intense price competition with respect to our brokerage business  including large block trades  spreads and trading commissions 
the ability to execute trades electronically and through other alternative trading systems has increased the pricing pressure on trading commissions and spreads  as well as affected the volume of trades being executed through traditional full service platforms 
in addition  we experience competition with respect to our asset management business both in the pursuit of investors for our investment funds and products and in the identification and completion of investments in attractive portfolio companies for our investment funds 
we compete for individual and institutional clients on the basis of price  the range of products we offer  the quality of our services as well as on the basis of financial resources available to us and invested in our products 
we may be competing with other investors and corporate buyers for the investments that we make 
we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future  including if some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices 
competition is also intense for the recruitment and retention of qualified professionals 
our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our continued ability to attract new professionals and retain and motivate our existing professionals

item a 
risk factors we face a variety of risks in our business  many of which are substantial and inherent in our business and operations 
the following are some of the important risk factors that could affect our business  our industry and holders of our common stock 
these risks are not exhaustive 
other sections of this annual report on form k may include additional factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
risks related to our business our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally 
our businesses  by their nature  do not produce predictable earnings  and are affected by changes in economic conditions generally and in particular by conditions in the financial markets 
over the past year  economic conditions and the state of the financial markets have changed suddenly  significantly and negatively which has affected and continues to affect our business and results of operations 
since mid  and particularly during the second half of  the financial services industry and the securities markets generally experienced significant valuation declines in virtually all asset categories 
this was initially triggered by the subprime mortgage crisis  but eventually spread to other asset classes  including equities 
financial markets over this period have been characterized by substantially higher volatility  a lack of liquidity and a general loss of investor confidence  initially in financial institutions  but more recently in companies in a number of other industries and in the broader markets  including the industries in which we specialize 
tighter credit has forced investors and other market participants to reduce leverage rapidly  which has exacerbated market volatility and contributed to further declines in asset values 
market conditions have also led to the failure or merger of a number of prominent financial institutions with which we compete 
financial institution failures or near failures have resulted in further losses and have also impacted the trading prices of shares in all financial institutions  including ours 
in addition  as of the end of  the united states and many other international markets are in a recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries  including the sectors in which we specialize  is greatly reduced 
the weakness in equity markets has resulted in diminished trading volume of securities that could adversely impact our brokerage business 
industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions transactions has had an adverse effect on our revenues 
reductions in the trading prices for equity securities tend to reduce the deal value of investment banking transactions  such as underwritings and mergers and acquisitions transactions  which in turn may reduce the fees we earn from these transactions 
also  difficult market conditions have decreased the value of assets under management in our asset management and private client business  which decrease the amount of asset based fees we receive  and may also affect our ability to attract additional  or retain existing  assets under management within these businesses 
in addition  as an investment bank focused principally on the growth sectors of the economy  we depend significantly on transactions by venture capital backed companies for sources of revenues and potential business opportunities 
to the extent venture capital investment activities slow due to difficult market conditions or otherwise  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 
our financial performance depends to a great extent on the economic environment in which we operate 
overall  fiscal was characterized by a business environment that was extremely adverse for our businesses and those of many of our clients and there can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term 
until they do  we expect our results of operations will continue to be adversely affected 
we focus principally on specific sectors of the economy  and a deterioration in the business environment in these sectors generally or decline in the market for securities of companies within these sectors could materially adversely affect our businesses 
we focus principally on the technology  healthcare  industrial growth  consumer  energy and mining sectors of the economy 
therefore  volatility in the business environment in these sectors generally  or in the market for securities of companies within these sectors particularly  could substantially affect our financial results and the market value of our common stock 
the business environment for companies in these sectors can experience substantial volatility  and our financial results may consequently be subject to significant variations from year to year 
the market for securities in each of our focus sectors may also be subject to industry specific risks 
for example  changes in policies by the united states food and drug administration may affect the market for securities of biotechnology and healthcare companies and volatility in the commodities markets may affect the market for securities of energy or mining companies that operate in the affected markets 
underwriting transactions  strategic advisory engagements and related trading activities in our focus sectors represent a significant portion of our businesses 
this concentration exposes us to the risk of substantial declines in revenues in the event of downturns in these sectors of the economy 
any future downturns in our focus sectors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our investment banking revenues may fluctuate substantially from period to period  which may impair our stock price 
we have experienced  and expect to experience in the future  significant periodic variations in our investment banking revenues which may be attributable in part to the fact that they are typically earned upon the successful completion of a transaction  the timing of which is uncertain and beyond our control 
in most cases we receive little or no payment for investment banking engagements that do not result in the successful completion of a transaction 
as a result  our business is highly dependent on market conditions as well as the decisions and actions of our clients and interested third parties 
for example  a client s acquisition transaction may be delayed or terminated because of a failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  failure to obtain necessary regulatory consents or board or shareholder approvals  failure to secure necessary financing  adverse market conditions or unexpected financial or other problems in the client s or counterparty s business 
if the parties fail to complete a transaction on which we are advising or an offering in which we are participating  we will earn little or no revenue from the transaction 
this risk may be intensified by our focus on growth companies as the market for securities of many of these companies has experienced significant variations in the number and size of equity offerings 
recently  more companies initiating the process of an initial public offering are simultaneously exploring merger and acquisition opportunities 
if we are not engaged as a strategic advisor in any such dual tracked process  our investment banking revenues would be adversely affected in the event that an initial public offering is not consummated 
in addition  we receive warrants from time to time as compensation for investment banking services which are adjusted to fair value through earnings in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap at the end of each quarter 
these fair value adjustments could increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings 
as a result  we are unlikely to achieve steady and predictable earnings on a quarterly basis  which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 
our ability to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals is critical to the success of our business  and our failure to do so may materially adversely affect our reputation  business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to obtain and successfully execute our business depends upon the personal reputation  judgment  business generation capabilities and project execution skills of our senior professionals  particularly thomas w 
weisel  our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  lionel f 
conacher  our president and chief operating officer  and the other members of our executive committee 
our senior professionals personal reputations and relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagements 
we encounter intense competition for qualified employees from other companies in the investment banking industry as well as from businesses outside the investment banking industry  such as investment advisory firms  hedge funds  private equity funds and venture capital funds 
from time to time  we have experienced losses of investment banking  brokerage  equity research and other professionals  and losses of our key personnel may occur in the future 
the departure or other loss of mr 
weisel  mr 
conacher  any other member of our executive committee or any other senior professional who manages substantial client relationships and possesses substantial experience and expertise  could impair our ability to secure or successfully complete engagements  protect our market share or retain assets under management  each of which  in turn  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
certain of our investment funds may be subject to key man provisions which  upon the departure or other loss of some or all of the investment professionals managing the fund  may permit the investors in the fund to dissolve the fund or may result in a reduction of the management fees paid with respect to the investment fund 
in connection with our initial public offering and our conversion to corporate form  many of our professionals received substantial amounts of common stock in exchange for their membership interests 
ownership of  and the ability to realize equity value from our common stock  unlike that of membership interests in thomas weisel partners group llc the predecessor to thomas weisel partners group  inc  does not depend upon continued employment and our professionals are not restricted from leaving us by the potential loss of the value of their ownership interests 
similarly  in connection with our acquisition of westwind  many of the westwind professionals received substantial amounts of common stock or shares exchangeable for common stock in consideration of their ownership interests in westwind 
ownership of  and the ability to realize equity value from our common stock or shares exchangeable for our common stock  unlike that of ownership interests in westwind  does not depend on continued employment and these professionals are not restricted from leaving us by potential loss of the value of their ownership interests 
these shares of common stock and shares exchangeable for common stock are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and a portion are pledged to secure liquidated damages obligations to us as set forth in the partners equity agreement and the westwind capital corporation shareholders equity agreement  each of which has been filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form k 
however  these agreements will survive for only a limited period and will permit any professional that is party thereto to leave us without losing any of their shares of common stock or shares exchangeable for common stock if they comply with these agreements  and  in some cases  compliance with these agreements may also be waived 
consequently  the steps we have taken to encourage the continued service of these individuals after our initial public offering may not be effective 
if any of our professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company  some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 
the compensation arrangements  non competition agreements and lock up agreements we have entered into with certain of our professionals may not prove effective in preventing them from resigning to join our competitors and the non competition agreements may not be upheld if we were to seek to enforce our rights under these agreements 
if we are unable to retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals  our reputation  business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
our efforts to limit compensation and benefits expense may hinder our ability to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals 
competitive pressures may require that our compensation and benefits expense increase in order to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals 
further  new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before realizing associated additional revenues 
additionally  we have granted equity awards in connection with our initial public offering and as part of our compensation and hiring process  the full expense of which is recognized pro rata over a three or four year vesting period 
the future expense associated with these grants could result in an increase to our compensation and benefits expense in and subsequent years 
as of december   there was i million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock unit awards made in connection with our initial public offering  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and ii an additional million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock unit awards made subsequent to our initial public offering  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
pricing and other competitive pressures may impair the revenues and profitability of our brokerage business 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our brokerage business 
along with other brokerage companies  we have experienced intense price competition in this business in recent years 
in particular  the ability to execute trades electronically and through other alternative trading systems has increased the pressure on trading commissions  volume and spreads and has required us to make investments in our brokerage business in order to compete 
we expect this trend toward alternative trading systems to continue 
we believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price 
in addition  we face pressure from our larger competitors  which may be better able to offer a broader range of complementary products and services to brokerage clients in order to win their trading business 
as we are committed to maintaining our comprehensive research coverage to support our brokerage business  we may be required to make substantial investments in our research capabilities 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors in these areas  brokerage revenues may decline and our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 
we face strong competition from larger firms 
the brokerage  investment banking and asset management industries are intensely competitive  and we expect them to remain so 
we compete on the basis of a number of factors  including client relationships  reputation  the abilities and past performance of our professionals  market focus and the relative quality and price of our services and products 
we have experienced intense price competition with respect to our brokerage business  including large block trades  spreads and trading commissions  as well as competition due to the increased use of commission sharing arrangements 
pricing and other competitive pressures in investment banking  including the trends toward multiple book runners  co managers and multiple financial advisors handling transactions  have continued and could adversely affect our revenues  even during periods where the volume and number of investment banking transactions are increasing 
competitive factors with respect to our asset management activities include the amount of firm capital we can invest in new products and our ability to increase assets under management  including our ability to attract capital for new investment funds 
we believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price 
we are a relatively small investment bank with approximately employees as of march  and had approximately million of excess regulatory capital at december  many of our competitors in the brokerage  investment banking and asset management industries have a broader range of products and services  greater financial and marketing resources  larger customer bases  greater name recognition  more senior professionals to serve their clients needs  greater global reach and more established relationships with clients than we have 
these larger and better capitalized competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the brokerage  investment banking and asset management industries  to compete for skilled professionals  to finance acquisitions  to fund internal growth and to compete for market share generally 
notwithstanding the displacement in the financial services industry that occurred in  the scale of our competitors has increased over time as a result of substantial consolidation among companies in the brokerage and investment banking industries 
in addition  a number of large commercial banks  insurance companies and other broad based financial services firms have established or acquired underwriting or financial advisory practices and broker dealers or have merged with other financial institutions 
these firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products than we do  which may enhance their competitive position 
they also have the ability to support investment banking with commercial banking  insurance and other financial services in an effort to gain market share  which has resulted  and could further result  in pricing pressure in our businesses 
in particular  the ability to provide financing has become an important advantage for some of our larger competitors and  because we do not provide such financing  we may be unable to compete as effectively for clients in a significant part of the brokerage and investment banking market 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected 
we have incurred losses and may incur losses in the future 
we recorded net losses of million for the year ended december  and may incur losses in the future 
if we are unable to finance future losses  those losses may have a significant effect on our liquidity as well as our ability to operate 
in addition  we may incur significant expenses in connection with initiating new business activities or in connection with any expansion of our underwriting  brokerage or asset management businesses 
we may also engage in strategic acquisitions and investments for which we may incur significant expenses 
accordingly  we will need to increase our revenues at a rate greater than our expenses to achieve and maintain profitability 
if our revenues do not increase sufficiently  or even if our revenues increase but we are unable to manage our expenses  we will not achieve and maintain profitability in future periods 
our capital markets and strategic advisory engagements are singular in nature and do not generally provide for subsequent engagements 
our strategy is to take a lifecycle approach in providing investment banking services to our clients  however  our investment banking clients generally retain us on a short term  engagement by engagement basis in connection with specific capital markets or mergers and acquisitions transactions  rather than on a recurring basis under long term contracts 
as these transactions are typically singular in nature and our engagements with these clients may not recur  we must seek out new engagements when our current engagements are successfully completed or are terminated 
as a result  high activity levels in any period are not necessarily indicative of continued high levels of activity in any subsequent period 
if we are unable to generate a substantial number of new engagements and generate fees from the successful completion of these transactions  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would likely be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our brokerage revenues are generated from a relatively small number of institutional clients 
a significant portion of our brokerage revenues are generated from a relatively small number of institutional clients 
for example  in we generated of our brokerage revenue  or approximately of our net revenues  from our ten largest brokerage clients 
similarly  in we generated of our brokerage revenue  or approximately of our net revenues  from our ten largest brokerage clients 
if any of our key clients departs or reduces its business with us and we fail to attract new clients that are capable of generating significant trading volumes  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected 
poor investment performance  pricing pressure and other competitive factors may reduce our asset management revenues or result in losses 
as part of our strategy  we are investing in the expansion of our asset management business 
our revenues from this business are primarily derived from management fees which are based on committed capital and or assets under management and incentive fees  which are earned if the return of our investment funds exceeds certain threshold returns 
our ability to maintain or increase assets under management is subject to a number of factors  including investors perception of our past performance  market or economic conditions  competition from other fund managers and our ability to negotiate terms with major investors 
investment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing clients and competing for new asset management and private equity business and our historical performance may not be indicative of future results 
poor investment performance and other competitive factors could reduce our revenues and impair our growth in many ways existing clients may withdraw funds from our asset management business in favor of better performing products  our incentive fees could decline or be eliminated entirely  firms with which we have business relationships may terminate these relationships with us  our capital investments in our investment funds or the seed capital we have committed to new asset management products may diminish in value or may be lost  and our key employees in the business may depart  whether to join a competitor or otherwise 
our investment funds include gains and losses that have not yet been realized through sales or other transactions 
these unrealized gains and losses are recognized in our results of operations because these investments are accounted for in accordance with gaap using the fair value method based on the percentage interest in the underlying partnerships 
the underlying investments held by such partnerships are valued based on quoted market prices or estimated fair value if there is no public market 
due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation  fair values of these non marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments  which differences could be material  and these differences may result in increased volatility in our asset management revenues 
to the extent our future investment performance is perceived to be poor in either relative or absolute terms  our asset management revenues will likely be reduced and our ability to raise new funds will likely be impaired 
even when market conditions are generally favorable  our investment performance may be adversely affected by our investment style and the particular investments that we make 
in addition  over the past several years  the size and number of investment funds  including exchange traded funds  hedge funds and private equity funds  has continued to increase 
this trend came to an end recently with the contraction of the credit markets and the general downturn of the economy  which have been major contributors to a reduction in the available investor capital pool 
this  coupled with the over allocation of many institutional investors to the alternative asset fund class  could make it increasingly difficult for us to raise capital for new investment funds 
also  difficult market conditions have decreased the value of assets under management in our asset management and private client business  which decreases the amount of asset based fees we receive  and may also affect our ability to attract additional  or retain existing  assets under management within these businesses 
increases in capital commitments in our trading  underwriting and other businesses increase the potential for significant losses 
the trend in capital markets is toward larger and more frequent commitments of capital by financial services firms in many of their activities 
for example  in order to attract clients  investment banks are increasingly committing capital to purchase large blocks of stock from publicly traded issuers or their significant shareholders  instead of the more traditional marketed underwriting process  in which marketing is typically completed before an investment bank commits capital to purchase securities for resale 
we have participated in this trend and expect to continue to do so 
as a result  we will be subject to increased risk as we commit greater amounts of capital to facilitate primarily client driven business 
furthermore  we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry 
we may enter into large transactions in which we commit our own capital as part of our trading business 
the number and size of these large transactions may materially affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows in a given period 
we may also incur significant losses from our trading activities due to market fluctuations and volatility from quarter to quarter 
we maintain trading positions in the fixed income and equity markets to facilitate client trading activities  and  at times  these positions can be large and concentrated in a single issuer 
to the extent that we own assets hold long positions  a downturn in the value of those assets or in those markets could result in losses 
conversely  to the extent that we have sold assets we do not own hold short positions  an upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially unlimited losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market 
we also commit capital to investment funds we sponsor and utilize our own funds as seed capital for new products and services in our asset management business 
these investments may diminish in value or may be lost entirely if market conditions are not favorable 
limitations on our access to capital could impair our liquidity and our ability to conduct our businesses 
liquidity  or ready access to funds  is essential to financial services firms 
failures of financial institutions have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity 
liquidity is of particular importance to our trading business and perceived liquidity issues may affect our clients and counterparties willingness to engage in brokerage transactions with us 
our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading clients  third parties or us 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time 
our asset management business is also subject to liquidity risk due to investments in high risk  illiquid assets 
we have made substantial principal investments in our investment funds and may make additional investments in future funds  which often invest in securities that are not publicly traded 
there is a significant risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy 
in particular  these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made  changes in national or international economic conditions or changes in laws  regulations  fiscal policies or political conditions of countries in which investments are made 
it takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of our investments through resale 
even if an investment proves to be profitable  it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash 
we have several broker dealer subsidiaries in several different jurisdictions which are each subject to the capital requirements of the relevant governmental and self regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions 
for example  thomas weisel partners llc  our largest broker dealer subsidiary  is subject to the net capital requirements of the sec and various self regulatory organizations of which it is a member 
these requirements typically specify the minimum level of net capital a broker dealer must maintain and also mandate that a significant part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form 
any failure to comply with these net capital requirements could impair our ability to conduct our core business as a brokerage firm 
furthermore  thomas weisel partners llc and our other broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from them to thomas weisel partners group  inc as a holding company  thomas weisel partners group  inc 
depends on distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund all payments on its obligations  including debt obligations 
as a result  regulatory actions could impede access to funds that thomas weisel partners group  inc needs to make payments on obligations  including debt obligations 
our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk 
our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk 
among other risks  we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets will not perform their obligations 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure  breach of contract or other reasons 
we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances 
as a clearing member firm  we finance our customer positions and could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers 
although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee 
in addition  concerns about  or a default by  one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions  which in turn could adversely affect us 
also  risk management policies and procedures that we utilize with respect to investing our own funds or committing our capital with respect to investment banking  trading activities or asset management activities may not protect us or mitigate our risks from those activities 
if any of the variety of instruments  processes and strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective  we may incur losses 
our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of increasingly complex transactions across diverse markets 
our financial  accounting or other data processing systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our offices 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled  if we experience difficulties in conforming these systems to changes in law or regulation or changes in our business activities or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity  financial loss  disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
we also face the risk of operational failure of any of our clearing agents  the exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
any such failure could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and to manage our exposure to risk 
in addition  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption due to transitioning from one third party service provider to another or due to a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business  whether due to fire  other natural disaster  power or communications failure  act of terrorism or war or otherwise 
nearly all of our employees in our primary locations  including san francisco  new york  toronto  london and boston  work in close proximity to each other 
if a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations  our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer and we may not be able to implement successfully contingency plans that depend on communication or travel 
insurance policies to mitigate these risks may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit 
further  any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain of these risks may not cover our loss 
our operations also rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
strategic investments or acquisitions and joint ventures may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business 
we intend to grow our business through both internal expansion and through strategic investments  acquisitions or joint ventures 
to the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures  we face numerous risks and uncertainties combining or integrating businesses  including integrating relationships with customers  business partners and internal data processing systems 
in the case of joint ventures  we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon  and subject to liability  losses or reputational damage relating to  systems  controls and personnel that are not under our control 
in addition  conflicts or disagreements between us and our joint venture partners may negatively impact our businesses 
any future acquisitions or joint ventures could entail a number of risks  including problems with the effective integration of operations  the inability to maintain key pre acquisition business relationships  the inability to retain key employees  increased operating costs  exposure to unanticipated liabilities  risks of misconduct by employees not subject to our control  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings  and exposure to new or unknown liabilities 
any future growth of our business may require significant resources and or result in significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities 
in addition  expansions  acquisitions or joint ventures may require significant managerial attention  which may be diverted from our other operations 
our international activities are subject to political  economic  legal  operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in a foreign country 
in connection with our business activities in canada  england and switzerland  and to the extent that we pursue other business opportunities outside the united states  we will be subject to political  economic  legal  operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in a foreign country  including risks of possible nationalization  expropriation  price controls  capital controls  exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions  as well as the outbreak of hostilities 
in many countries  the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving  and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market 
our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular foreign market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 
we are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions 
as we expand our international operations  we will increase our exposure to foreign currency risk 
as a result of the expanded international operations  we hold assets  incur liabilities  earn revenues and pay expenses in foreign currencies  including the canadian dollar  the swiss franc and the pound sterling 
because our financial statements will continue to be presented in us dollars  we will be required to translate assets  liabilities  income and expenses that relate to our international operations and that are denominated in foreign currencies into us dollars at the then applicable exchange rates 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus the various foreign currencies will affect the value of these items in our financial statements  even if their value has not changed in such foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be more volatile as a result of our international operations 
evaluation of our prospects may be more difficult in light of our limited operating history 
our company was formed in and we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and prospects 
in addition  we acquired westwind in  which was formed in and which also has a limited operating history 
as a relatively young enterprise  we are subject to the risks and uncertainties that face a company during its formative development 
some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to attract and retain clients on a cost effective basis  expand and enhance our service offerings  raise additional capital and respond to competitive market conditions 
we may not be able to address these risks adequately  and our failure to do so may adversely affect our business and the value of an investment in our common stock 
despite the completion of the thomas weisel partners and westwind integration  the combined company may not realize synergies  efficiencies or cost savings 
prior to the completion of the acquisition of westwind in  thomas weisel partners and westwind operated independently 
despite the completion of the integration of westwind and thomas weisel partners  there can be no assurance that the combined company will realize any synergies  efficiencies or cost savings or that any of these benefits will be achieved within a specific time frame 
we could be subject to unknown liabilities of westwind  which could cause us to incur substantial financial obligations and harm our business 
although the former westwind shareholders are required to indemnify us for certain breaches of representations and warranties made in the arrangement agreement governing our acquisition of westwind  the shareholders obligation is subject to monetary and time limitations 
in addition  if we are entitled to indemnification by the former westwind shareholders  it may be costly to enforce those rights and or we may not be successful in collecting amounts we are entitled to 
if there are liabilities of westwind of which we are not aware  we may have little or no recourse against the former westwind shareholders and may be obligated to bear the costs of those liabilities 
in addition  many of the former westwind shareholders have continued as employees of the combined company following closing of the transaction 
accordingly  if an indemnifiable claim does arise  we may need to weigh the need to be indemnified for that claim against the potential employee distraction or damage to employee relations that may result if we were to seek recourse for that claim 
as a result of the acquisition of westwind  we are subject to additional risks relating to westwind s business 
as a result of the acquisition of westwind  we are subject to the risks relating to westwind s business 
because the risks and uncertainties facing us may differ from those that faced westwind  the market price  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the combined company may be affected by risks and uncertainties different from those affecting us prior to the acquisition 
these risks include the following westwind s focus on specific sectors of the economy westwind s investment banking business focused principally on the mining and energy sectors of the economy 
as a result of the acquisition of westwind  the combined company s business has more exposure to these sectors than thomas weisel partners business had prior to the transaction 
volatility in the business environment in these sectors generally  including the related commodities markets  or in the market for securities of companies within these sectors  could substantially affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
westwind s focus on canada westwind generated a substantial majority of its revenues from canadian based clients 
as a result  westwind s business and results of operations was highly dependent on the strength of the canadian economy 
as a result of the acquisition of westwind  we expect that a significant portion of the combined company s business will be derived from canadian based clients 
accordingly  our business will be affected by changes in the canadian economy and investment activity in canada 
to the extent that we experience a decline in business in canada  due to unfavorable conditions in the canadian economy or otherwise  we may not be able to offset these declines by increases in other aspects of our business and our financial results could suffer 
risks related to our industry risks associated with regulatory impact on capital markets 
highly publicized financial scandals in recent years have led to investor concerns over the integrity of the us financial markets  and have prompted congress  the sec and finra to significantly expand corporate governance and public disclosure requirements 
to the extent that private companies  in order to avoid becoming subject to these new requirements  decide to forgo initial public offerings  our equity underwriting business may be adversely affected 
in addition  provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and the corporate governance rules imposed by self regulatory organizations have diverted many companies attention away from capital market transactions  including securities offerings and acquisition and disposition transactions 
in particular  companies that are or are planning to be public are incurring significant expenses in complying with the sec and accounting standards relating to internal control over financial reporting  and companies that disclose material weaknesses in such controls under the new standards may have greater difficulty accessing the capital markets 
these factors  in addition to adopted or proposed accounting and disclosure changes or changes in laws and regulations governing brokerage and research activities  may have an adverse effect on our business 
financial services firms have been subject to increased scrutiny over the last several years  increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions 
firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment 
the us financial services industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators  including the sec  finra and state attorneys general 
penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years 
this regulatory and enforcement environment has created uncertainty with respect to a number of transactions that had historically been entered into by financial services firms and that were generally believed to be permissible and appropriate 
we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self regulatory organizations 
we also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec  other united states or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets 
among other things  we could be fined  prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business prospects 
in addition  financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts 
the sec and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest 
we have adopted various policies  controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts and regularly seek to review and update our policies  controls and procedures 
however  appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult  and our reputation could be damaged if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest 
our policies and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts may also result in increased costs  additional operational personnel and increased regulatory risk 
failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or client litigation 
our exposure to legal liability is significant  and damages that we may be required to pay and the reputational harm that could result from legal action against us could materially adversely affect our businesses 
we face significant legal risks in our businesses  and  in recent years  the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have been increasing 
these risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions  potential liability for fairness opinions and other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements 
we are also subject to claims arising from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment  among other things 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify  and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
our role as advisor to our clients on important underwriting or mergers and acquisitions transactions involves complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment  including rendering fairness opinions in connection with mergers and other transactions 
therefore  our activities may subject us to the risk of significant legal liabilities to our clients and aggrieved third parties  including shareholders of our clients who could bring securities class actions against us 
our investment banking engagements typically include broad indemnities from our clients and provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services  but these provisions may not protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases 
for example  an indemnity from a client that subsequently is placed into bankruptcy is likely to be of little value to us in limiting our exposure to claims relating to that client 
as a result  we may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against litigation and may be required to pay substantial damages for settlements and adverse judgments 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows or cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business and prospects 
regulatory and legal developments related to auction rate securities could adversely affect our business 
since february  the auctions through which most auction rate securities are sold and interest rates are determined have failed  resulting in a lack of liquidity for these securities 
the failure of those auctions was a direct result of decisions without warning by the broker dealers that underwrote those auction rate securities and managed the associated auctions not to commit the capital needed to maintain those auctions 
we  together with many other firms in the financial services industry  have received inquiries from finra requesting information concerning purchases through the company of auction rate securities by private client services customers 
separately  we have been named in a finra arbitration filed by a private client services retail customer who purchased auction rate securities 
the company did not  at any time  underwrite auction rate securities or manage the associated auctions 
in connection with such auctions  the company merely served as agent for its private client services customers when buying in auctions managed by underwriters 
nevertheless  some combination of finra and or the company s private client services customers could seek to compel the company to purchase auction rate securities from the company s customers  and the company does not have sufficient regulatory capital and cash or borrowing capacity to repurchase all of the auction rate securities held by those customers 
the company is and has been exploring a range of potential solutions for its private client services customers and strongly supports the efforts of industry participants  including particularly the efforts of those underwriters of auction rate securities who have entered into settlements with the sec and other regulators that contain best efforts commitments to repurchase auction rate securities  to resolve issues relating to the lack of liquidity for auction rate securities 
while the company s review of the need for any loss contingency reserve in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  has led the company to conclude that  based upon currently available information and consultation with its counsel  the company does not currently need to establish a provision for loss related to auction rate securities held by retail clients  the company is not able to predict with certainty the outcome of auction securities related matters and there can be no assurance that those matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in any future period  and a significant judgment or settlement could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition  operations and cash flows 
employee misconduct could harm us and is difficult to detect and deter 
there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years  and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur at our company 
for example  misconduct by employees could involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases  and we may suffer significant reputational harm for any misconduct by our employees 
risks related to ownership of our common stock taken together  a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock and shares exchangeable for common stock is owned or controlled by our senior professionals and their interests may differ from those of other shareholders 
our chief executive officer  thomas w 
weisel  beneficially owns approximately of our common stock outstanding  and our president and chief operating officer  lionel f 
conacher  beneficially owns approximately of our common stock outstanding including shares exchangeable for common stock 
mr 
weisel and mr 
conacher  together with the other members of our executive committee  collectively own approximately of our common stock outstanding including shares exchangeable for common stock  and together with our current employees own a significant percentage of our common stock outstanding 
as a result of these shareholdings  our current employees are effectively able to elect our entire board of directors  control our management and policies  in general  determine without the consent of the other stockholders the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the shareholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
our senior professionals are effectively able to prevent or cause a change in control of us 
these actions may be taken even if other shareholders oppose them 
provisions of our organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of us 
our organizational documents contain provisions that could impede the removal of directors and may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us 
for example  our board of directors may  without the consent of shareholders  issue preferred stock with greater voting rights than our common stock

our business is managed as a single operating segment and we generate revenues by providing financial services that include investment banking  brokerage  equity research and asset management 
we take a comprehensive approach in providing these services to growth companies 
we are exposed to volatility and trends in the general securities market and the economy  and we are currently facing difficult market and economic conditions 
due to the recent downturn in the market and the economic recession  client activity levels have decreased resulting in  among other things  lower overall investment banking activity 
it is difficult to predict when conditions will change 
fiscal year was a very challenging environment for the capital markets given the unprecedented events on wall street that led to increased uncertainty and turmoil in the us economy and global financial markets 
we are focused on making the necessary adjustments to our business and adapting to the current environment 
we are planning for to be a continuation of and are focused on the following items preserving capital and retaining key people in order to emerge as a strong player once market stability returns  reducing compensation and non compensation expenses in order to operate break even on a cash basis or better  and enhancing the value of our franchise with opportunistic hires  particularly in the advisory business  to be ready to build market share when stability returns to the capital markets 
in january  our headcount increased by approximately employees as a result of our acquisition of westwind 
subsequent to the acquisition  during and through february  we reduced our total headcount by approximately employees  or approximately 
the reductions were primarily in underperforming areas of our business as well as non revenue producing departments 
as of march   we have approximately employees 
we will continue to selectively hire to upgrade our talent pool  particularly in revenue generating areas  and make additional key hires as appropriate 
in addition to the headcount reductions noted above  base salaries for employees with titles of vice president and above were reduced by as of january  during  in addition to the headcount and salary reductions discussed above  we executed on the following initiatives acquisition and integration of westwind on january   we completed our acquisition of westwind  and integrating westwind has been a primary focus during in september  our two uk broker dealer subsidiaries  thomas weisel partners international limited and thomas weisel partners uk limited  successfully merged into one entity 
in october  we completed an internal reorganization of our us broker dealer subsidiaries to eliminate redundancies and unnecessary expense 
as a result of this reorganization  the business of thomas weisel partners usa inc was consolidated with that of thomas weisel partners llc 
one of our ongoing integration strategies has been to expand our trading in canadian securities as our energy and mining analysts begin to make a greater impact on our us and european accounts  and we currently plan to hire us based energy bankers and analysts to capitalize on westwind s capabilities in canada 
in europe  where we integrated our offices in early  we have combined our sales forces and are marketing the combined companies products and expertise 
repurchase of common stock during  we repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock 
the shares were classified as treasury stock upon repurchase  and we intend to use these shares to settle obligations to deliver common stock in the future to employees who have received restricted stock units under our equity incentive plan 
these repurchases were executed pursuant to an authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to  shares of common stock for the purpose of settling obligations to deliver common stock to employees who have received restricted stock units under our equity incentive plan

reduction of the convertible book size we have significantly reduced our convertible trading book from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  we experienced losses during the year ended december  related to the convertible book which we do not expect to incur in due to the fact that we have significantly reduced our exposure to convertible securities 
exiting of facilities we exited portions of our office facilities in san francisco  new york  montreal and london due to staff reductions 
as a result  we recorded a lease loss provision of million during the year ended december  consolidated results of operations our results of operations depend on a number of market factors  including market conditions and valuations for growth companies and growth investors  as well as general securities market conditions 
trends in the securities markets are also affected by general economic trends  including fluctuations in interest rates  flows of funds into and out of the markets and other conditions 
in addition to these market factors  our revenues from period to period are substantially affected by the timing of investment banking transactions in which we are involved 
fees for many of the services we provide are earned only upon the completion of a transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations in any individual year or quarter may be affected significantly by whether and when significant transactions are completed 
notwithstanding this exposure to volatility and trends  in order to provide value to our clients  we have made a long term commitment to maintaining a substantial  full service integrated business platform 
as a result of this commitment  if business conditions result in decreases to our revenues  we may not experience corresponding decreases in the expense of operating our business

investment banking revenues are typically recognized at the completion of each transaction 
underwriting revenues are presented net of related expenses 
unreimbursed expenses associated with private placement and advisory transactions are recorded as non compensation expenses

the remaining partnerships net unrealized losses were primarily due to fair value adjustments resulting generally from a decline in the equity markets and lack of liquidity in the capital markets 
these conditions combined to create a lack of available financing at previous valuation levels resulting in downward fair value adjustments for certain companies held by these funds

compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  overtime  bonuses  commissions  share based compensation  benefits  severance  employment taxes and other employee costs 
we pay discretionary bonuses based on a combination of company and individual performance  and we have entered into guaranteed contractual agreements with employees that require specified bonus payments  both of which are accrued over the related service periods 
these bonuses make up a significant portion of our compensation and benefits expense 
share based awards constitute a portion of our compensation expense  and as a general matter  vest over a three or four year service period  are subject to continued employment and  accordingly  are recorded as non cash compensation expense ratably over the service period beginning at the date of grant 
as a result  our aggregate compensation expense has been  and will continue to be  impacted as we recognize multiple years of share based compensation expense associated with the vesting of prior year grants 
as of december   there was i million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock unit awards made in connection with our initial public offering  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and ii an additional million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock unit awards made subsequent to our initial public offering  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as part of a special retention and incentive program  in august we granted  restricted stock unit equity awards to senior employees of the company as a means of incentivizing and retaining our key producers 
the restricted stock units vest after the end of a three year period 
we also granted  performance based restricted stock unit equity awards to certain members of the executive committee that will vest upon the attainment of the company s long term performance goals 
the performance based restricted stock unit equity awards granted to the executive committee are earned and become payable based on both a service and performance condition 
the service condition requires the executive to be employed by the company from the date of grant through the vesting date 
the performance condition provides for pre established targets relating to several performance measures that are determined over a performance period from july  to june  specifically  these performance measures are based on i gaap revenue per employee  ii gaap net income margin and iii gaap return on equity 
such targets relate to the company as a whole 
if the service and performance conditions are met  the restricted stock unit equity awards will vest on august   and the underlying shares will be delivered on or about the related vesting date 
the total grant date fair value of these restricted stock unit equity awards was million 
in addition  during  performance based restricted stock unit equity awards have been granted to employees as part of our regular hiring process 
we estimate the fair value of performance based restricted stock units awarded to employees at the grant date of the equity instruments 
the fair value is based on the market price of our common stock on the grant date 
we also consider the probability of achieving the established targets in determining our share based compensation with respect to these awards 
we recognize compensation cost over a three year service period 
we have put in place incentive compensation arrangements that are structured under separate limited liability company agreements in order to incentivize certain of our professionals responsible for managing such business 
compensation expense associated with these payments to these individuals was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as previously discussed  during and through february  we reduced our total headcount by approximately as compared to our headcount on january  the reductions were primarily in underperforming areas of our business as well as non revenue producing departments

versus compensation and benefits expense decreased million in from included in this decrease are expenses of million related to the acquisition of westwind 
excluding the impact from the westwind acquisition  compensation and benefits expense would have decreased million during this fluctuation was primarily the result of a decrease in bonus expense of million 
the reduction in bonus expense is due to the overall decrease in our operations as well as the one time compensation expense in the fourth quarter of attributable to the acceleration of the payment of mid year retention bonuses 
in addition  salary expense decreased million during the same period due to our reduction in non westwind employee headcount during this decrease is partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of million as a result of additional grants of restricted stock units made during compensation and benefits expense in and included million and million  respectively  of non cash compensation expense relating to share based awards made in connection with our initial public offering 
versus compensation and benefits expense increased million in from the increase primarily relates to the one time compensation expense of million in the fourth quarter of attributable to the acceleration of the payment of mid year retention bonuses and certain severance expenses  each of which were related to the integration of westwind

excluding the goodwill impairment  intangible amortization and the impact from the westwind acquisition  non compensation expense would have increased million during the increase of million in non compensation expense includes an increase in occupancy and equipment expense of million during from primarily due to our exiting certain office space in september and december for which we recorded a million lease loss charge 
in addition  brokerage execution  clearance and account administration increased million during from as a result of increased brokerage activity during the period as well as the outsourcing of our our nyse floor brokerage during communication and data processing expense increased by million due to increased costs associated with our expansion into canada  europe and the midwest 
this overall increase of million is partially offset by a decrease of million in marketing and promotion primarily due to a decrease in client related travel and conference expenses in versus non compensation expenses increased million in from the overall increase in non compensation expenses was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotion expense  other expenses and communication expense of million  million and million  respectively 
marketing and promotion expense increased primarily due to increased travel and entertainment related to the geographic expansion of our business 
other expense increased as a result of expenses related to a third party private equity management agreement which began in late and communications expenses increased due to our opening additional offices during these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in brokerage  execution  clearance and account administration expense due to improved efficiencies in our trade execution practices and lower nyse exchange rate fees  as well as less clearance charges associated with lower trading volume 
provision for taxes before completion of our initial public offering on february   we were a limited liability company and all of our income and losses were reportable by our individual members  and  accordingly  the us federal and state income taxes payable by our members  based upon their share of our net income  had not been reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our initial public offering  we reorganized from a limited liability company into a corporation  and following that reorganization became subject to us federal and state income taxes

business combination on january   we acquired westwind and under the agreement  we indirectly acquired percent of westwind s outstanding shares and westwind became our indirect subsidiary 
total consideration was approximately million  which consisted of million in cash   shares of the company s common stock valued at per share based on the average closing price over a five day period starting two days prior to the acquisition announcement date of october  and ending two days after the announcement date and direct acquisition costs of million consisting primarily of legal  accounting and advisory fees 
common stock issued includes  exchangeable shares  which are shares issued by a canadian subsidiary of the company and are exchangeable for shares of the company s common stock 
during the year ended december   we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization which was affected by the uncertainty in the financial markets 
the tightening of the credit markets contributed to a sharp decline in our capital raising investment banking revenues during the same period 
based on the difficult conditions in business climate and our perception that the climate is unlikely to change in the near term  we recorded a full impairment charge to the goodwill asset of million that was recorded as part of the westwind acquisition 
the impairment charge was determined based on our fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis  and we considered our market capitalization to determine the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our current level of equity capital  current cash balances  funds anticipated to be provided by operating activities and funds available to be drawn under temporary loan agreements  will be adequate to meet our liquidity and regulatory capital requirements for the next months 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  operating activities used million of cash and cash equivalents during our net loss excluding non cash items contributed million to the decrease in cash 
additionally  in february  we made aggregate cash bonus payments to our employees of million  as well as an aggregate cash payment of million to our employees attributable to the acceleration of the payment of mid year retention bonuses and certain severance expenses 
during  we had a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million which is due to the fact that we have made cash payments to settle accrued expenses that were recorded as of december  the overall decrease in our cash and cash equivalents from operating activities is partially offset by the partial liquidation of our convertible holdings as well as an overall decrease in our net securities owned positions which provided million of cash 
investing activities provided million of cash and cash equivalents during the proceeds from sales of investments in partnerships and other investments during were million primarily relating to the sale of auction rate securities 
we used these proceeds to fund our million cash payment for the acquisition of westwind in january and to fund bonus and severance payments discussed in the operating activities discussion above 
cash received as a result of our acquisition of westwind was million 
in addition  during we purchased investments in partnerships and other investments of million and purchased property and equipment of million 
financing activities used million of cash and cash equivalents during primarily due to the repurchase of our common stock from the open market for million and the repayment of notes payable of million 
in addition  we net settled million of equity awards that became deliverable to our employees during auction rate securities as of december   we held auction rate securities ars with a par value of million and fair value of million 
the ars are variable rate debt instruments  having long term maturity dates approximately to years  but whose interest rates are reset through an auction process  most commonly at intervals of  and days 
the interest earned on these investments is exempt from federal income tax 
all of our ars are backed by pools of student loans and are rated either aaa  aa or a at december  we continue to receive interest when due on our ars and expect to continue to receive interest when due in the future 
the weighted average federal tax exempt interest rate was at december  in january  we sold a substantial portion of our ars holdings at par and used the proceeds to partially fund our acquisition of westwind 
subsequent to january  auction failures increased significantly 
while it was not unusual for supply to outweigh demand  banks running the auctions had historically absorbed the excess supply in order to ensure a successful auction and a liquid market 
this process came to a halt as the result of the dislocation in the credit markets during the principal balance of our ars will not be accessible until successful auctions occur  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the issuers and the underwriters establish a different form of financing to replace these securities or final payments come due according to the contractual maturities 
as a result of the auction failures  we evaluate the credit risk and compare the yields on our ars to similarly rated municipal issues 
our valuation of our ars assesses the credit and liquidity risks associated with the securities and determines the fair values based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
key assumptions of the discounted cash flow analysis included the following coupon rate in determining fair value  we projected future interest rates based on the average near term historical interest rate for these issues  the securities industry and financial markets association municipal swap index and benchmark yield curves 
the average interest rates assumed ranged from to 
discount rate our discount rate was based on a spread over the aa municipal general education yield curve and consisted of a spread of to bps over this yield curve which we adjusted down to bps over periods of time ranging from twelve to nineteen quarters 
this spread is included in the discount rate to reflect the current and expected illiquidity  which we expect to trend toward the mean in the ars market 
the average spread between our ars and the aa municipal general education yield curve between august and august  a period in which auctions were not likely to fail  averaged less than basis points 
timing of liquidation our cash flow projections consisted of various scenarios for each security wherein we valued the ars to points in time where it was in the interest of the issuer  based on the fail rate  to redeem the securities 
our concluded values for each security were based on the average valuation of these various scenarios 
for the securities analyzed  the shortest average time to liquidation was assumed to be months 
based on the results of the discounted cash flow analysis  we determined that our ars had a decline in fair value of million during the year ended december  debt financing in connection with our initial public offering of common stock  we issued million of unsecured senior notes to our former class d and class d shareholders and are required to make principal and interest payments on these notes in accordance with their terms 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance under these notes was million and is due in january in april  thomas weisel partners llc  our us broker dealer subsidiary  entered into a million revolving note and subordinated loan agreement

we previously had a financing arrangement with general electric capital corporation  the balance of which was million as of december  we paid all outstanding principal and interest to general electric capital corporation in may bonus and share based compensation the timing of bonus compensation payments to our employees may significantly affect our cash position and liquidity from period to period 
while our employees are generally paid salaries semi monthly during the year  bonus payments  which make up a larger portion of total compensation  have historically been paid in february and july 
in february  we made aggregate cash bonus payments to our employees of approximately million and granted equity awards with a grant date fair value of million

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and their notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
fair value of financial instruments statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date 
investments included in this category are listed equities 
as required by sfas no 
 we do not adjust the quoted price of these investments  even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably be expected to affect the quoted price 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date  and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies 
investments which are generally included in this category are convertible bonds 
level pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the investment 
the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation 
investments included in this category generally are general partnership interests in private investment funds  warrants  auction rate securities and convertible bonds that cannot be publicly offered or sold unless registration has been affected under the securities act of securities owned  securities sold  but not yet purchased and investments in partnerships and other investments on our consolidated statements of financial condition consist of financial instruments carried at fair value  with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in our results of operations 
the use of fair value to measure these financial instruments  with related unrealized gains and losses recognized immediately in our results of operations  is fundamental to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of financial instruments is derived using observable market prices  observable market parameters or broker or dealer prices bid and ask prices  if available 
in the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges  the observable market prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded 
for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument  the same price within the bid ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions 
for financial instruments that do not have readily determinable fair values through quoted market prices  the determination of fair value is derived using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques involve some degree of management judgment 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of our securities owned and securities sold  but not yet purchased are based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or derived from broker or dealer prices 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
when available  observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques involve some degree of management judgment 
for investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available 
among the factors considered by us in determining the fair value of financial instruments are the cost  terms and liquidity of the investments  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  the quoted market price of publicly traded securities with similar quality and yield and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
in instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions  the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions 
even where the value of a security is derived from an independent source  certain assumptions may be required to determine the security s fair value 
for example  we assume that the size of positions that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if we sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current estimated fair value 
private investments may also be valued at cost for a period of time after an acquisition as the best indicator of fair value 
financial instruments carried at contract amounts have short term maturities one year or less  are repriced frequently or bear market interest rates and  accordingly  those contracts are carried at amounts approximating fair value 
financial instruments carried at contract amounts on our consolidated statements of financial condition include receivables from and payables to clearing brokers and corporate finance and syndicate receivables 
instruments that trade infrequently or have no market and therefore have little or no price transparency are classified within level based on the results of our price verification process 
our level assets were million at december  this balance primarily consists of investments in funds managed by the company s asset management subsidiaries and unaffiliated general partners  ars and private investments in the equity of operating companies 
in january  we experienced a significant increase in ars failures 
while it was not unusual for supply to outweigh demand  banks running the auctions had historically absorbed the excess supply in order to ensure a successful auction and a liquid market 
this process came to a halt as the result of the dislocation in the credit markets during  at which point we transferred our auction rate securities into the level category 
the valuation of our ars is based on a discounted cash flow method which assesses the credit and liquidity risks associated with the securities to determine the fair values 
investments in partnerships and other investments investments in partnerships and other investments include our general and limited partnership interests in investment partnerships and direct investments in non public companies 
these interests are carried at estimated fair value 
the net assets of investment partnerships consist primarily of investments in non marketable securities 
the underlying investments held by such partnerships and direct investments in non public companies are valued based on estimated fair value ultimately determined by us in our capacity as general partner or investor and  in the case of an investment in an unaffiliated investment partnership  are based on financial statements prepared by an unaffiliated general partner 
due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation  fair values of these non marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments  and the differences could be material 
increases and decreases in estimated fair value are recorded based on underlying information of these non public company investments including third party transactions evidencing a change in value  market comparables  operating cash flows and financial performance of the companies  trends within sectors and or regions  underlying business models  expected exit timing and strategy  and specific rights or terms associated with the investment  such as conversion features and liquidation preferences 
in cases where an estimate of fair value is determined based on financial statements prepared by an unaffiliated general partner  such financial statements are generally unaudited other than audited year end financial statements 
upon receipt of audited financial statements from an investment partnership  we adjust the fair value of the investments in our subsequent financial statements to reflect the audited partnership results if they differ from initial estimates 
we also perform procedures to evaluate fair value estimates provided by unaffiliated general partners 
the investment partnerships in which we are a general partner may allocate carried interest and make carried interest distributions to the general partner if the partnerships investment performance reaches a threshold as defined in the respective partnership agreements 
we recognize the allocated carried interest when this threshold is met  however future investment underperformance may require amounts previously distributed to us to be returned to the partnership 
we earn fees from the investment partnerships which we manage or of which we are a general partner 
such management fees are generally based on the net assets or committed capital of the underlying partnerships 
through march   we agreed in certain cases to waive management fees  in lieu of making a cash contribution  in satisfaction of our general partner investment commitments to the investment partnerships 
in these cases  we generally recognize our management fee revenues at the time when we are allocated a special profit interest in realized gains from these partnerships 
with respect to the investment partnerships existing as of march   we will no longer waive management fees subsequent to march  liability for lease losses our accrued expenses and other liabilities include a liability for lease losses related to office space that we subleased or vacated due to staff reductions in and in prior years 
the liability for lease losses was million at december  and will expire with the termination of the relevant facility leases through we estimate our liability for lease losses as the net present value of the differences between lease payments and receipts under sublease agreements 
legal and other contingent liabilities we are involved in various pending and potential complaints  arbitrations  legal actions  investigations and proceedings related to our business 
some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts  including claims for punitive and other special damages 
the number of complaints  arbitrations  legal actions  investigations and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions like us has been increasing in recent years 
we have  after consultation with counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  to the extent we have determined a claim will result in a probable loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management and our ultimate liabilities may be materially different 
in making these determinations  management considers many factors  including  but not limited to  the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant  the basis and validity of the claim  the likelihood of successful defense against the claim and the potential for  and magnitude of  damages or settlements from such pending and potential complaints  arbitrations  legal actions  investigations and proceedings  and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies 
see note commitments  guarantees and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report of form k for a further description of legal proceedings 
additionally  we will record receivables for insurance recoveries for legal settlements and expenses when such amounts are covered by insurance and recovery of such losses or costs are considered probable of recovery 
these amounts will be recorded as other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition and will reduce other expense  to the extent such losses or costs have been incurred  in the consolidated statements of results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts our receivables include corporate finance and syndicate receivables relating to our advisory and investment banking engagements 
we also have receivables from our clearing brokers in connection with the clearing of our brokerage transactions 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on a specific identification basis 
management is continually evaluating our receivables for collectibility and possible write off by examining the facts and circumstances surrounding each specific case where a loss is deemed a possibility 
deferred tax valuation allowance in determining our provision for income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
for our investments in partnerships  adjustments to the carrying value are made based on determinations of the fair value of underlying investments held by such partnerships 
both upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of investment partnerships  which are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations  represent timing differences until such time as these gains and losses are realized 
sfas no 
states that a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of all available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence  including both positive and negative evidence 
sfas no 
provides that the realization of deferred tax assets  including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period 
sfas no 
requires the consideration of all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset  including the future reversal of existing temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in carryback years and tax planning strategies 
our operations are in a cumulative loss position for the three year period ended december   primarily created by poor operating results in due to the challenging environment for the capital markets 
for purposes of assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets  this cumulative taxable loss position is considered significant negative evidence and has caused us to conclude that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future 
as of december   we recorded a full valuation allowance of million on our us deferred tax assets 
in addition  we have a valuation allowance of million on our uk deferred tax asset as of december  management will reassess the realization of the deferred tax assets based on the criteria of sfas no 
each reporting period 
to the extent that our financial results improve and the deferred tax asset becomes realizable  we will be able to reduce the valuation allowance through earnings 
during the three months ended march   we recognized a one time tax benefit upon conversion to a corporation in connection with the establishment of our deferred tax asset balances  partially offset by a valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance was recorded because management at that time  concluded that a portion of the deferred tax benefit  which resulted from unrealized capital losses  more likely than not would not be realized due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate future capital gains to offset such capital losses 
during however  the performance of the underlying investments in our investments in partnerships exceeded our estimates  significantly reducing our net unrealized capital loss and accordingly  our valuation allowance by million 
as of december   the deferred tax asset recorded to reflect these net unrealized losses was million  and the related valuation allowance was million 
in  we recorded net capital gains of million  which included the recognition of previously recorded unrealized gains 
as a result  our deferred tax asset associated with our net unrealized loss increased by million for the period ending december  however  due to the significant recognition of capital gains in the current year  the continued performance of our investments and our expectation of being able to reduce unrealized capital losses through recognition and future unrealized capital gains  we reduced our valuation allowance to zero 
in reducing our valuation allowance  we recognized deferred tax benefit of million during resulting in a reduction in the effective tax rate 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values 
such allocations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets acquired 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include  but are not limited to  i future expected cash flows from acquired businesses  ii future expected cash flows from employees subject to non compete agreements and iii the acquired company s market position 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
goodwill and long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we are required to evaluate goodwill annually to determine whether it is impaired 
goodwill is also required to be tested between annual impairment tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we selected the fourth quarter to perform our annual goodwill impairment testing 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
during the year ended december   we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization which was affected by the uncertainty in the financial markets 
the tightening of the credit markets contributed to a sharp decline in our capital raising investment banking revenues during the same period 
based on the difficult conditions in business climate and our perception that the climate is unlikely to change in the near term  we recorded a full impairment charge to the goodwill asset of million 
the impairment charge was determined based on our fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis  and we considered our market capitalization to determine the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow 
we account for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets utilizing statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
while we believe our estimates and judgments about future cash flows are reasonable  future impairment charges may be required if the expected cash flow estimates  as projected  do not occur or if events change requiring us to revise our estimates  and thereby result in non cash charges to our earnings in the period in which we make the adjustment

we are also exposed to other risks in the conduct of our business such as credit risk and the effects of inflation 
our exposure to these risks could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
set forth below is a discussion of some of these risks together with quantitative information regarding the aggregate amount and value of financial instruments that we hold or in which we maintain a position or that we have issued and that remain outstanding  in each case  as of december  and due to the nature of our business  in particular our trading business  the amount or value of financial instruments that we hold or maintain a position in will fluctuate on a daily and intra day basis  and the year end values and amounts presented below are not necessarily indicative of the exposures to market risk  interest rate risk and other risks we may experience at various times throughout any given year 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price 
market risk may be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities and or at normal bid offer spreads 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as a financial intermediary in customer trading and to our market making  investment banking and investment activities  which activities include committing from time to time to purchase large blocks of stock from publicly traded issuers or their significant shareholders

interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential loss from adverse changes in market interest rates 
as we may hold us treasury securities and auction rate securities  as well as convertible debt securities  and incur interest sensitive liabilities from time to time  we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and in the shape of the yield curve 
certain of these interest rate risks may be managed through the use of short positions in us government and corporate debt securities and other instruments

credit risk our broker dealer subsidiaries place and execute customer orders 
the orders are then settled by unrelated clearing organizations that maintain custody of customers securities and provide financing to customers 
the majority of our transactions  and consequently the concentration of our credit exposure  is with our clearing brokers 
the clearing brokers are also the primary source of our short term financing securities sold  but not yet purchased  which is collateralized by cash and securities owned by us and held by the clearing brokers 
our securities owned may be pledged by the clearing brokers 
the amount receivable from or payable to the clearing brokers represents amounts receivable or payable in connection with the proprietary and customer trading activities 
as of december  and  our cash on deposit with the clearing brokers of million and million  respectively  was not collateralizing any liabilities to the clearing brokers 
in addition to the clearing brokers  we are exposed to credit risk from other brokers  dealers and other financial institutions with which we transact business 
through indemnification provisions in our agreement with our clearing organizations  customer activities may expose us to off balance sheet credit risk 
we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices in the event a customer fails to settle a trade on its original terms or in the event cash and securities in customer margin accounts are not sufficient to fully cover customer obligations 
we seek to control the risks associated with brokerage services for our customers through customer screening and selection procedures as well as through requirements that customers maintain margin collateral in compliance with governmental and self regulatory organization regulations and clearing organization policies 
effects of inflation due to the fact that our assets are generally liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as employee compensation  office leasing costs and communications charges  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
regulatory and legal risk legal risk includes the risk of customer and or regulatory claims in connection with auction rate securities matters 
while these claims may not be the result of any wrongdoing  we do  at a minimum  incur costs associated with investigating and defending against such claims 
in addition  we are generally subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements as described in item business regulation and are subject to potentially sizable adverse legal judgments or arbitration awards  and fines  penalties  and other sanctions for non compliance with those legal and regulatory requirements 
we have comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  the extension of credit  including margin loans  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping
