we have adopted a product strategy that leverages our core competencies in video processing to address the evolving needs of the advanced flat panel display  digital projection and other markets that require superior image quality 
we focus our product investments on developing video enhancement solutions for these markets  with particular focus on adding increased performance and functionality 
additionally  we look for ways to leverage our research and development investment into products that address other high value markets where our innovative proprietary technology provides differentiation for us and our customers 
historically  significant portions of our revenue have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of end customers and distributors 
we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force and indirectly 
table of contents through distributors and manufacturers representatives 
we sell to distributors in japan  china  europe and the u 
s  and our manufacturers representatives support some of our european and korean sales 
sales to distributors represented   and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales to tokyo electron device  ltd 
ted  our japanese distributor  represented  and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales to seiko epson corporation  our top end customer  represented  and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our distributors typically provide engineering support to our end customers and often have valuable and established relationships with our end customers 
in certain countries it is customary to sell to distributors 
while distributor payment to us is not dependent upon the distributor s ability to resell the product or to collect from the end customer  the distributors may provide longer payment terms to end customers than those we would offer 
significant portions of our products are sold overseas 
sales outside the us accounted for approximately of revenue for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  and our integrators  branded manufacturers and branded suppliers incorporate our products into systems that are sold worldwide 
all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
factors affecting results of operations and financial condition general market conditions economic conditions in the united states and in foreign markets in which we operate substantially affect our sales and profitability 
economic activity in the united states and throughout much of the world has undergone a sudden  sharp downturn 
global credit and capital markets have experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption and business credit and liquidity have tightened in much of the world 
some of our suppliers and customers may face credit issues and could experience cash flow problems and other financial hardships 
consumer confidence and spending are down significantly and we expect weaker demand from our customers to persist into these trends are expected to adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial position and we are unable to forecast when or if these conditions will improve 
restructuring plans in december  we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce our operating expenses in response to decreases in current and forecasted revenue 
the plan will reduce operations  research and development and administrative headcount in our san jose  taiwan and china offices  and we expect the plan to be substantially complete in the first quarter of we will continue to monitor and evaluate the need for additional restructuring actions in light of global economic uncertainty and its potential impact on our continuing business 
while the need for additional restructuring actions in response to decreased revenue is being evaluated  uncertainty regarding the outlook for and beyond impedes our ability to forecast the scope and impact of any potential actions 
in november  we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and continued to implement this plan throughout and this plan included consolidation of our operations in order to reduce compensation and rent expense  while at the same time making critical infrastructure investments in people  processes and information systems to improve our operating efficiency 
as part of this plan we closed offices in toronto  beijing and shenzhen 
additionally  we eliminated all operations and research and development activities at our tualatin location and transferred them to our offices in san jose  shanghai and hsin chu 
the consolidation and closure of these offices and reduction in headcount resulted in charges for non cancelable leases and termination and retention benefits for effected employees 
in connection with this restructuring  we also narrowed and redefined our product development strategy which resulted in the write off of ip assets  tooling  software development tools and charges for related non cancelable contracts 
this plan was completed during the fourth quarter of in april  we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce our breakeven point by decreasing manufacturing overhead and operating expenses and focusing on our core business 
the plan included integrating the internet protocol television iptv technology that we acquired from equator technologies  inc equator with 
table of contents our advanced television technology developments and no longer pursuing stand alone advanced media processor markets 
we also consolidated our two california offices as part of this plan  which was completed during the fourth quarter of goodwill and intangible asset impairments during  we performed impairment analyses on the intangible assets that we acquired from equator and on our goodwill 
in the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss of million on the acquired intangible assets 
this impairment loss represented the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets 
in the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss of million on goodwill 
this impairment loss represented the excess carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill

all of our investments were denominated in us dollars  and our portfolio did not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral 
the quality of our short term investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment 
our investment policy requires that at least of our portfolio matures within days 
additionally  no maturities can extend beyond one year and concentrations with individual securities are limited 
investments must be rated at least a p by standard poor s moody s  and our investment policy is reviewed at least annually by our audit committee 
the valuations of our short term marketable securities are affected by a variety of factors  including changes in interest rates and the actual or perceived financial stability of the issuer 
however  due to the high quality of our investments and their short term nature  there has not been  and we do not expect there to be  a significant fluctuation in the valuation of these investments 
accordingly  we do not expect a materially negative impact on our financial condition from fluctuations in the value of our short term investments 
as of december   we had a total unrealized gain of  on these investments 
the valuation of our long term equity investment has fluctuated significantly  and could continue to fluctuate significantly  due to a variety of factors including changes in the global economy and changes in the actual or expected performance of the issuing company 
we recorded other than temporary impairments related to this investment of million and million in the first and fourth quarter of  respectively 
we may record additional impairment charges in the future if we determine that further declines in value of the investment are other than temporary 
such an impairment would negatively impact our results of operations  but would not materially impact our financial condition 
when available  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available  we use quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  or use observable inputs other than the quoted prices  to determine fair value 
we have no investments which are fair valued based on unobservable inputs

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  property and equipment  intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of investments  amortization of prepaid royalties  valuation of share based payments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when an authorized purchase order has been received  title and risk of loss have transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
this generally occurs upon shipment of the underlying product 
sales returns and allowances 
our customers do not have a stated right to return product except for replacement of defective products under our warranty program discussed below 
however  we have accepted customer returns on a case by case basis as customer accommodations in the past 
as a result  we provide for these returns in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the reserve for returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
certain of our distributors have stock rotation provisions in their distributor agreements  which allow them to return of the products purchased in the prior six months in exchange for products of equal value 
we analyze historical stock rotations at the end of each reporting period 
to date  returns under the stock rotation provisions have been nominal 
certain distributors also have price protection provisions in their distributor agreements with us 
under the price protection provisions  we grant distributors credit if they purchased product for a specific customer and we subsequently lower the price to the customer such that the distributor can no longer earn its negotiated margin on in stock inventory 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for price protection credits based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
the reserve for price protection is included in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
product warranties 
we warrant that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of twelve months from delivery 
warranty repairs are guaranteed for the remainder of the original warranty period 
our warranty is limited to repairing or replacing products  or refunding the purchase price 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for warranty returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  which include actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  should actual product failure rates or product replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we offer credit to customers after careful examination of their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical write off experience and the age of outstanding receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation 
we record a reserve against our inventory for estimated obsolete  unmarketable  and otherwise impaired products by calculating the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we review our inventory at 
table of contents the end of each reporting period for valuation issues 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected at the time the reserve was recorded  additional inventory write downs may be required 
useful lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the remaining useful life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if there is an indicator of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of each asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
while we have concluded that the carrying value of our long lived assets is recoverable as of december   our analysis is dependent upon our estimates of future cash flows  and our actual results may vary 
valuation of investments 
in accordance with fsp fas fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  we apply judgment in determining whether our marketable securities are other than temporarily impaired 
when performing our evaluation  we consider the duration of the decline  future prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the security to recovery 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
we estimate the fair value of share based payments using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires certain estimates  including an expected forfeiture rate and expected term of options granted 
we also make decisions regarding the method of calculating expected volatilities and the risk free interest rate used in the option pricing model 
the resulting calculated fair value of share based payments is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
when there are changes to the assumptions used in the option pricing model  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  there will be variations in the calculated fair value of the share based payments  which results in variation in the compensation cost recognized 
income taxes 
we record deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement we conduct a comprehensive review of our uncertain tax positions regularly 
in this regard  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities  we do not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and report the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases payments on accrued balances related to asset purchases estimated q purchase commitments to contract manufacturers other purchase obligations and commitments total the earliest date on which the holders of our convertible subordinated debentures due have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding debentures is may  we expect holders of the debentures to require us to purchase all of the outstanding debentures on that date 
the operating lease payments above are net of sublease rental income of   and  for the years ending december   and respectively 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions  therefore  million of income taxes payable has been excluded from the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements and accounting changes see note summary of significant accounting policies in part ii  item of this form k for a description of accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations impact the interest income that we earn on our investment portfolio and the value of our investments 
factors that could cause interest rates to fluctuate include volatility in the credit and equity markets  such as the current uncertainty in global economic conditions  changes in the monetary policies of the united states and other countries and inflation 
we mitigate risks associated with such fluctuations  as well as the risk of loss of principal  by investing in high credit quality securities and limiting concentrations of issuers and maturity dates 
derivative financial instruments are not part of our investment portfolio 
applying a hypothetical decrease in interest rates to the average balances of our interest bearing cash and investment accounts would have decreased our interest income by approximately  in as of december  a significant majority of our cash and investments are held as cash or in money market funds with yields approaching zero and our interest income is relatively insensitive to future decreases in interest rates 

table of contents as of december   we had convertible subordinated debentures of million outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 
interest rate changes affect the fair value of the debentures  but do not affect our earnings or cash flow 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our sales 
we have employees located in offices in japan  taiwan and the people s republic of china and as such  a portion of our operating expenses as well as foreign income taxes payable are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we cannot reasonably estimate the effect that an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our operating results or cash flows 
currently  we do not hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations
