table of contents overview businesses loral is a leading satellite communications company with a satellite manufacturing unit and investments in satellite services businesses 
loral is organized into two operating segments  satellite manufacturing and satellite services 
for the final two months of and going forward  loral participates in satellite services operations principally through its investment in telesat canada 
satellite manufacturing space systems loral  inc ss l  designs and manufactures satellites  space systems and space system components for commercial and government customers whose applications include fixed satellite services fss  direct to home dth broadcasting  mobile satellite services mss  broadband data distribution  wireless telephony  digital radio  digital mobile broadcasting  military communications  weather monitoring and air traffic management 
satellite manufacturers have high fixed costs relating primarily to labor and overhead 
based on its current cost structure  we estimate that ss l covers its fixed costs  including depreciation and amortization  with an average of four to five satellite awards a year depending on the size  power  pricing and complexity of the satellite 
cash flow in the satellite manufacturing business tends to be uneven 
it takes two to three years to complete a satellite project and numerous assumptions are built into the estimated costs 
ss l s cash receipts are tied to the achievement of contract milestones that depend in part on the ability of its subcontractors to deliver on time 
in addition  the timing of satellite awards is difficult to predict  contributing to the unevenness of revenue and making it more challenging to align the workforce to the workflow 
while its requirement for ongoing capital investment to maintain its current capacity is relatively low  over the past two years ss l has modified and expanded its manufacturing facilities to accommodate an expanded backlog 
ss l can now accommodate as many as nine to satellite awards per year  depending on the complexity and timing of the specific satellites  and can accommodate the integration and test of to satellites at any given time in its palo alto facility 
the expansion has also reduced the company s reliance on outside suppliers for certain rf components and sub assemblies 
the satellite manufacturing industry is a knowledge intensive business  the success of which relies heavily on its technological heritage and the skills of its workforce 
the breadth and depth of talent and experience resident in ss l s workforce of approximately  personnel is one of our key competitive resources 
satellites are extraordinarily complex devices designed to operate in the very hostile environment of space 
this complexity may lead to unanticipated costs during the design  manufacture and testing of a satellite 
ss l establishes provisions for costs based on historical experience and program complexity to cover anticipated costs 
as most of ss l s contracts are fixed price  cost increases in excess of these provisions reduce profitability and may result in losses to ss l  which may be material 
because the satellite manufacturing industry is highly competitive  buyers have the advantage over suppliers in negotiating prices  terms and conditions resulting in reduced margins and increased assumptions of risk by manufacturers such as ss l 
satellite services the satellite services business is capital intensive and the build out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment 
once these investments are made  however  the costs to maintain and operate the fleet are relatively low with the exception of in orbit insurance 
upfront investments are earned back through the leasing of transponders to customers over the life of the satellite 
after nearly years of operation  telesat canada has established collaborative relationships with its customers so annual receipts from the satellite services business are fairly predictable with long term contracts and high contract renewal rates 
competition in the satellite services market has been intense in recent years due to a number of factors  including transponder over capacity in certain geographic regions and increased competition from fiber 
this 
table of contents competition puts pressure on prices  depending on market conditions in various geographic regions and frequency bands 
as of march   telesat canada had in orbit satellites comprised of both owned and leased satellites 
nimiq is expected to be decommissioned in the second quarter of excluding the satellite to be decommissioned in telesat canada s fleet as of march  had an average of approximately of their expected total service life remaining  with an average expected remaining service life in excess of years 
in addition  one satellite was launched in february and is expected to enter service in the second quarter of  while one satellite under construction at ss l is scheduled for launch later in the satellite under construction is already contracted to bell tv for years or such later date as the customer may request 
until the closing of the telesat canada transaction on october   loral skynet operated a global fixed satellite services business 
as part of this business  loral skynet leased transponder capacity to commercial and government customers for video distribution and broadcasting  high speed data distribution  internet access and communications  and also provided managed network services to customers using a hybrid satellite and ground based system 
it also provided professional services to other satellite operators such as fleet operating services 
future outlook critical success factors for ss l include maintaining its reputation for reliability  quality and superior customer service 
these factors are vital to securing new customers and retaining current ones 
at the same time  we must continue to contain costs and maximize efficiencies 
ss l is focused on increasing bookings and backlog  while maintaining the cost efficiencies and process improvements realized over the past several years 
ss l must continue to align its direct workforce with the level of awards 
additionally  long term growth at ss l generates working capital requirements  primarily for the orbital component of the satellite contract which is payable to ss l over the life of the satellite 
the current economic environment may reduce the demand for satellites 
while we expect the replacement market to be reliable over the next year  given the current credit crisis  potential customers who are highly leveraged or in the development stage may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to purchase satellites 
if ss l s satellite awards fall below  on average  four to five awards per year  we expect that we will reduce costs and capital expenditures to accommodate this lower level of business 
the timing of any reduced demand for satellites is difficult to predict 
it is therefore also difficult to anticipate when to reduce costs and capital expenditures to match any slowdown in business 
a delay in matching the timing of a reduction in business with a reduction in expenditures would adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  in order to maintain its ability to compete as one of the leading prime contractors for technologically advanced space satellites  ss l must continuously retain the services of a core group of specialists in a wide variety of disciplines for each phase of the design  development  manufacture and testing of its products  thus reducing ss l s flexibility to take action to reduce workforce costs in the event of a slowdown or downturn in its business 
loral holds a economic interest and a voting interest in telesat canada  the world s fourth largest satellite operator with approximately billion of backlog as of december  telesat canada is committed to continuing to provide the strong customer service and focus on innovation and technical expertise that has allowed it to successfully build its business to date 
building on its industry leading backlog and significant contracted growth  telesat canada s focus is on taking disciplined steps to grow the core business and sell newly launched and existing in orbit satellite capacity  and  in a disciplined manner  use the strong cash flow generated by existing business  contracted expansion satellites and cost savings to strengthen the business 
telesat canada believes its existing satellite fleet offers a strong combination of existing backlog  contracted revenue growth on nimiq which started service in the fourth quarter of  and on the in construction satellite nimiq and additional capacity on the existing satellites and telstar n which is expected to start service in the second quarter of that provides a solid foundation upon which it will seek to grow its revenues and cash flows 

table of contents telesat canada has received a non binding offer for certain of its international satellites and related assets and business 
these assets represented approximately of telesat canada s revenues and of its adjusted ebitda for the year ended december   and less than of its backlog as of december  one of these satellites is nearing the end of its life and telesat canada must make a decision in with respect to replacing it  which would cost approximately million to million  incurred over a period of approximately three years 
if it is not sold  telesat canada s current intention is to replace this satellite  although no final decision has been made at this time 
subject to telesat canada s obligations under its financing arrangements  proceeds from any sale of these assets would be used to fund replacement satellites or repay debt 
the offer is subject to further due diligence and other conditions  and telesat canada cannot at this time assess the probability of concluding this transaction or any other sale of these satellite assets or at what price these satellites may be sold 
telesat canada believes that it is well positioned to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates 
telesat canada actively pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  particularly in conjunction with current or prospective customers  who will commit to a substantial amount of capacity at the time the satellite construction contract is signed 
although telesat canada regularly pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  it does not procure additional or replacement satellites unless it believes there is a demonstrated need and a sound business plan for such capacity 
the satellite industry is characterized by a relatively fixed cost base that allows significant revenue growth with relatively minimal increases in operating costs  particularly for sales of satellite capacity 
thus  telesat canada anticipates that it can increase its revenue without proportional increases in operating expenses  allowing for margin expansion 
the fixed cost nature of the business  combined with contracted revenue growth and other growth opportunities is expected to produce growth in operating income and cash flow 
for  telesat canada is focused on the execution of its business plan to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates  the sale of capacity on its existing satellites  the continuing efforts to achieve operating efficiencies  and on the completion and launch of its in construction satellite nimiq 
we regularly explore and evaluate possible strategic transactions and alliances 
we also periodically engage in discussions with satellite service providers  satellite manufacturers and others regarding such matters  which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets 
in order to pursue certain of these opportunities  we will require additional funds 
there can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances  nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for these transactions on favorable terms  if at all 
in connection with the telesat canada transaction  loral has agreed that  subject to certain exceptions described in telesat canada s shareholders agreement  for so long as loral has an interest in telesat canada  it will not compete in the business of leasing  selling or otherwise furnishing fixed satellite service  broadcast satellite service or audio and video broadcast direct to home service using transponder capacity in the c band  ku band and ka band including in each case extended band frequencies and the business of providing end to end data solutions on networks comprised of earth terminals  space segment  and  where appropriate  networking hubs 
consolidated operating results please refer to critical accounting matters set forth below in this section 
the following discussion of revenues and adjusted ebitda  see note to the financial statements  reflects the results of our business segments for  and the balance of the discussion relates to our consolidated results unless otherwise noted 
the common definition of ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in evaluating financial performance  we use revenues and operating income loss before depreciation and amortization including amortization of stock based compensation adjusted ebitda as the measure of a segment s profit or loss 
adjusted ebitda is equivalent to the common definition of ebitda before goodwill and other impairment charges  gain loss on foreign exchange contracts  gains or losses on litigation not related to our operations  impairment of available for sale securities  loss on extinguishment of debt  other income expense  equity in net losses of affiliates  and minority interest 

table of contents adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare our operating results with that of competitors exclusive of depreciation and amortization  interest and investment income  interest expense  goodwill and other impairment charges  gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts  gains or losses on litigation not related to our operations  impairments of available for sale securities  other income expense  equity in net losses of affiliates and minority interest 
financial results of competitors in our industry have significant variations that can result from timing of capital expenditures  the amount of intangible assets recorded  the differences in assets lives  the timing and amount of investments  the effects of other income expense  which are typically for non recurring transactions not related to the on going business  and effects of investments not directly managed 
the use of adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare operating results exclusive of these items 
competitors in our industry have significantly different capital structures 
the use of adjusted ebitda maintains comparability of performance by excluding interest expense 
we believe the use of adjusted ebitda along with us gaap financial measures enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and investors in comparing performance with competitors  estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions 
adjusted ebitda as used here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by competitors 
we also use adjusted ebitda to evaluate operating performance of our segments  to allocate resources and capital to such segments  to measure performance for incentive compensation programs and to evaluate future growth opportunities 
adjusted ebitda should be used in conjunction with us gaap financial measures and is not presented as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance 
loral is organized into two operating segments satellite manufacturing and satellite services

our equity in net loss of telesat canada excludes amortization of the fair value adjustments applicable to telesat canada s acquisition of the loral skynet assets and liabilities 
our equity in net loss of telesat canada also reflects the elimination of our profit  to the extent of our beneficial interest  on satellites we are constructing for them 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets consists primarily of an impairment charge to reduce orbital slot assets to fair value 
other expense  net includes non cash foreign exchange losses of million and million and non cash gains on financial instruments of million and million in and  respectively 
telesat canada s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions are made in currencies other than canadian dollars 
telesat canada s main currency exposures as of december   lie in its us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt financing 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
we estimated that  after considering the impact of hedges  a five percent weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar at december  would have increased telesat canada s net loss for the year by approximately million  while a five percent strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar at december  would have decreased telesat canada s net loss for the year by approximately million

backlog backlog as of december  and was as follows in millions satellite manufacturing satellite services total backlog before eliminations satellite manufacturing eliminations satellite services eliminations total backlog it is expected that of satellite manufacturing backlog as of december  will be recognized as revenue during telesat canada backlog at december  was approximately billion  of which approximately will be recognized as revenue during included in backlog as of december  is a contract covering the entire capacity of the nimiq satellite  which has been leased for the life of the satellite 
this contract contains provisions such that the customer  assuming the satellite is successfully and timely launched and is operating nominally  may only terminate its contract by paying telesat canada the present value of the entire contracted amounts that would have been due for the remaining life of the satellite 
as of december   telesat canada had received approximately million of customer prepayments  including approximately million relating to satellites under construction 
if the launch of a satellite under construction were to fail or a customer were to terminate its contract with telesat canada as a result of a substantial delay in the launch of the satellite  telesat canada would be obligated to return the customer prepayments applicable to such satellite 
such repayment obligations would be funded by insurance proceeds if any  cash on hand and or borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility 
critical accounting matters the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for the period 
actual results could differ from estimates 
fresh start accounting in connection with our emergence from chapter  we adopted fresh start accounting as of october   which required all of our assets and liabilities to be stated at estimated fair value 
significant judgment was exercised by management in estimating the fair values 

table of contents revenue recognition most of our satellite manufacturing revenue is associated with long term fixed price contracts 
revenue and profit from satellite sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method  which requires significant estimates 
we use this method because reasonably dependable estimates can be made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates include forecasts of costs and schedules  estimating contract revenue related to contract performance including estimated amounts for penalties  performance incentives and orbital incentives that will be received as the satellite performs on orbit and the potential for component obsolescence in connection with long term procurements 
these estimates are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when estimates determine that a loss will be incurred on a contract at completion 
under firm fixed price contracts  work performed and products shipped are paid for at a fixed price without adjustment for actual costs incurred in connection with the contract  accordingly  favorable changes in estimates in a period will result in additional revenue and profit  and unfavorable changes in estimates will result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that will be borne solely by us 
billed receivables  vendor financing and long term receivables we are required to estimate the collectibility of our billed receivables which are included in contracts in process on our consolidated balance sheet  vendor financing and long term receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
charges for recoveries of bad debts recorded to the income statement on billed receivables for the years ended december   and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
at december  and  billed receivables were net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are re evaluated periodically 
inventories inventories are reviewed for estimated obsolescence or unusable items and  if appropriate  are written down to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
these are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the inventory 
charges for inventory obsolescence recorded to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and were insignificant 
charges for inventory obsolescence recorded to the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  were million 
fair value measurements all available for sale securities are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  to define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us gaap and expand disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas establishes a fair value measurement hierarchy to price a particular asset or liability 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities such as goodwill  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the company s financial statements at fair value at least annually 
accordingly  the company adopted the provisions of sfas only for its financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis effective january  the company s financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  consist of marketable securities which were valued at million and foreign exchange forward contracts valued at million 
the company has no financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of 
table of contents december  the marketable securities are classified as level and the foreign exchange forward contracts are classified as level in the fair value measurement hierarchy under sfas as of december  a level fair value represents a fair value that is derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date 
a level fair value represents a fair value which is derived from observable market data ie benchmark yields  spot rates and other industry and economic events 
level loral s marketable securities  which are included in other current assets  consisted entirely of an investment in the common stock of globalstar inc see note to the financial statements 
loral s investment in globalstar inc is accounted for as an available for sale security under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
generally  unrealized gains and losses on this investment are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges of million for other than temporary declines in the value of our investment in globalstar inc common stock 
level during  loral entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts  with maturities through  designed to manage the risk of currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash receipts associated with a satellite manufacturing contract denominated in euros 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and are tested quarterly for effectiveness 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the remaining gain or loss is included in income 
the company has elected to use the income approach to value the derivatives  using observable level ii market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount assuming participants are motivated  but not compelled to transact 
level ii inputs are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability including interest rates and credit risk 
as of december   the fair value of these contracts was million  of which million was included in other current assets and million was included in other assets based upon the maturity dates of the forward contracts 
during the year ended december   we recorded a reduction to revenue of million and recorded an unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income of million related to these contracts 
evaluation of investments in affiliates for impairment the carrying values of our investments in affiliates are reviewed for impairment in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
we monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other than temporary impairment 
an impairment loss would be recognized when there has been a loss in value of the affiliate that is other than temporary 
evaluating investments in affiliates for impairment requires significant subjective judgments by management 
taxation loral is subject to us federal  state and local income taxation on its worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the united states 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to taxation in local jurisdictions 
telesat canada is subject to tax in canada and other jurisdictions and loral will provide in operating earnings any additional us current or deferred tax required on distributions received or deemed distributions from telesat canada 
we use the liability method in accounting for taxes whereby income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions are recorded in the financial statements 
deferred taxes reflect the future tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting and are measured by applying statutory tax rates in effect for the year during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  based upon this analysis  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria in sfas based upon this analysis  we concluded during the fourth quarter of that  due to 
table of contents insufficient positive evidence substantiating recoverability  a valuation allowance should be established for our net deferred tax assets 
for  we continued to maintain the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets increasing the valuation allowance at december  of million by million to a balance of million at december   which included million relating to the opening balance at october  as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million  which when offset by our deferred tax liabilities of million and our valuation allowance of million  resulted in a net deferred tax asset of million on our consolidated balance sheet 
we will maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
in the future  if we were to determine that we will be able to realize all or a portion of the benefit from our deferred tax assets  under sfas r any reduction to the valuation allowance balance at october  will be recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision 
during  we reversed million of excess valuation allowance relating to the balance as of october   which was recorded as a reduction to goodwill in accordance with sfas effective january   we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for benefits to be recognized in the financial statements  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense see note to the financial statements 
prior to adopting fin  our policy was to establish tax contingency liabilities for potential audit issues 
the tax contingency liabilities were based on our estimate of the probable amount of additional taxes that may be due in the future 
any additional taxes due would be determined only upon completion of current and future federal  state and international tax audits 
management has concluded that  as of december   the previously reported material weakness relating to our accounting for and disclosure of income taxes has been remediated 
pension and other employee benefits we maintain a pension plan and a supplemental retirement plan 
these plans are defined benefit pension plans 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees and dependents 
these pension and other employee benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  as well as our actual experience 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  based on a hypothetical yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality  corporate  non callable bonds with maturities that match our projected benefit payment stream 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of the plan liability cash flows to the yield curve 
changes in applicable high quality long term corporate bond indices  such as the moody s aa corporate bond index  are also considered 
the discount rate determined on this basis was as of december   which was unchanged from december  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the plan s projected benefit obligation  asset mix and the fact that its assets are actively managed to mitigate risk 
allowable investment types include equity investments and fixed income investments 
pension plan assets are managed by russell investment corp 
russell  which allocates the assets into specified russell designed funds as we direct 
each specified russell fund is then managed by investment managers chosen by 
table of contents russell 
the targeted long term allocation of our pension plan assets is in equity investments and in fixed income investments 
based on this target allocation  the twenty five year historical return of our asset mix has been 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets determined on this basis was for  for and for for  we will use an expected long term rate of return of 
these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs are expected to increase to approximately million in from million in  primarily due to the decrease in the expected return on assets and increased amortization of actuarial losses 
lowering the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return each by would have increased these pension and other employee postretirement benefits costs by approximately million and million  respectively  in the benefit obligations for pensions and other employee benefits exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million at december  the unfunded benefit obligations 
we are required to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan on our balance sheet 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of loral s pension and other employee benefits plans 
stock based compensation we use the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
in addition  we account for options granted to non employees in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to measure fair value of these stock option awards 
the black scholes merton model requires us to make significant judgments regarding the assumptions used within the model  the most significant of which are the stock price volatility assumption  the expected life of the option award  the risk free rate of return and dividends during the expected term 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of stock based compensation we recognize 
see notes and to the financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the amount by which the company s reorganization equity value exceeded the fair value of its tangible assets and identified intangible assets less its liabilities  as of october   the date we adopted fresh start accounting 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test  or if events and circumstances change and indicators of impairment are present  goodwill will be tested for impairment between annual tests 
as a result of the decline of loral s stock price and the decline in comparable company values  we performed an interim impairment test as of june  and updated our annual impairment test through november  this most recent impairment test resulted in the recording of an impairment charge in for the entire goodwill balance of million see notes and to the financial statements 
the company s estimate of the fair value of ss l employed both a comparable public company analysis  which considered the valuation multiples of companies deemed comparable  in whole or in part  to the company and a discounted cash flow analysis that calculated a present value of the projected future cash flows of ss l 
the company considered both quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions used in the valuation process 
testing goodwill for impairment requires significant subjective judgments by management 
goodwill also had been reduced by the decreases to the valuation allowance as of october  and other tax adjustments see income taxes  below and the transfer in october of substantially all of the assets and related liabilities of loral skynet in connection with the telesat canada transaction 
for the year ended december  we recorded a reduction to goodwill in the amount of related to the reduction of our income tax valuation allowance as of october  as of december   intangible assets consist primarily of internally developed software and technology and trade names recorded in connection with the adoption of fresh start accounting 
the fair values of our intangible assets were calculated using several approaches that encompassed the use of excess earnings  relief from royalty and the build up methods 
the excess earnings  relief from royalty and build up approaches are variations of the income approach 
the income approach  more commonly known as the discounted cash flow 
table of contents approach  estimates fair value based on the cash flows that an asset can be expected to generate over its useful life 
this process involves subjective judgment by management 
identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
contingencies contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss  if any 
we accrue for costs relating to litigation  claims and other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable 
such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management s judgment  as appropriate 
actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated  and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made 
management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments 
the most important contingencies affecting our financial statements are detailed in note to the financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
liquidity and capital resources loral as described above  the company s principal assets are ownership of of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ss l and a non controlling economic interest in telesat canada 
in addition  the company has a non controlling economic interest in xtar 
ss l s operations are consolidated in the company s financial statements while the operations of telesat canada and xtar are not consolidated but presented using the equity method of accounting 
the parent company has no debt 
ss l and telesat canada both have third party debt with financial institutions and xtar has debt to its llc member  hisdesat  loral s joint venture partner in xtar 
in addition  xtar has an obligation to arianespace  sa which it expects will be fully satisfied by june  the parent company has provided a guarantee of the ss l debt but has not provided a guarantee for the telesat canada or xtar debt 
cash is maintained at the parent company  ss l  telesat canada and at xtar to support the operating needs of each respective entity 
the ability of ss l and telesat canada to pay dividends and management fees in cash to the parent company is governed by applicable covenants relating to the debt at each of those entities and in the case of telesat canada and xtar by their respective shareholder agreements 
cash and available credit at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash 
on october   ss l entered into a million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks the ss l credit agreement and as of december   million was drawn in the form of loans and approximately million was issued in the form of letters of credit 
restricted cash decreased approximately million during due to the release of restrictions on cash relating to the skynet noteholders litigation million and to the replacement of ss l s former letter of credit facility million 
at february   the company had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash remained at the year end level  and ss l had reduced its borrowings under the ss l credit agreement to million 
this improvement in our net cash position is primarily the result of receipt of satellite contract milestone payments in the first quarter of cash management we have a cash management investment program that seeks a competitive return while maintaining a conservative risk profile 
our cash management investment policy establishes what we believe to be conservative guidelines relating to the investment of surplus cash 
the policy allows us to invest in commercial paper  money market funds and other similar short term investments but does not permit us to engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it permit us to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the cash management investment policy was designed to preserve capital and safeguard principal  to meet all of our liquidity requirements 
table of contents and to provide a competitive rate of return 
the policy addresses dealer qualifications  lists approved securities  establishes minimum acceptable credit ratings  sets concentration limits  defines a maturity structure  requires all firms to safe keep securities on our behalf  requires certain mandatory reporting activity and discusses review of the portfolio 
we operate the cash management investment program under the guidelines of our investment policy and continuously monitor the investments to avoid risks 
we currently invest our cash in several liquid money market funds 
these money market funds include treasury funds  government funds  and prime aaa funds 
the dispersion across funds reduces the exposure of a default at one fund 
we do not currently hold any investments in auction rate securities or enhanced money market funds that have been subject to liquidity issues and price declines 
liquidity at the parent company  we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our projected expenditures for the year 
for  these expenditures include funding operating costs of approximately million  net of management fees  funding approximately million for our portion of the construction and launch of the viasat satellite  million of attorney fees that were paid in january as required under the implementing order by the court of chancery in the delaware plaintiffs litigation regarding the issuance of our series preferred stock to mhr in see note to the financial statements and an additional million investment in xtar see note to the financial statements 
the company has also received a request for indemnification from its directors who are affiliated with mhr for legal costs in the delaware plaintiffs litigation see note to the financial statements that may or may not be recoverable from insurance 
we believe that ss l  telesat canada and xtar will have sufficient liquidity to fund their respective operations and capital requirements and make all required debt service as discussed below 
telesat canada s debt agreements contain restrictions relating to the cash payments under loral s consulting agreement with telesat canada and restrict the payment of cash dividends above million 
as a result  the parent company expects that in the next year the million annual fee under its consulting agreement with telesat canada will continue to be paid in subordinated notes rather than cash  and that it will not receive cash dividends from telesat canada 
in addition to our cash on hand we may consider accessing the capital markets for debt or equity at the parent company 
the proceeds of a debt or equity offering would be used to further strengthen our balance sheet  given the ongoing difficult financial environment  and provide liquidity to fund various potential growth opportunities for our business lines 
this would not only provide for the contingencies at ss l discussed below but also bolster the confidence of ss l s customers in ss l as a critical supplier 
given the current environment  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms acceptable to us  if at all 
space systems loral cash in  ss l  largely related to supporting growth  used approximately million of cash from operations primarily from increased contract assets of approximately million resulting from milestone payments from customers that lagged behind ss l expenditures  and the funding of approximately million of orbital receivables net of million prepayment on its satellite contracts in the normal course  offset by approximately million in net income adjusted for non cash items 
in addition  capital expenditures of approximately million in were in excess of recurring requirements which we expect to normalize at million to million in future years as ss l substantially completed its facility expansion and continues its program of upgrading next generation test equipment 
in  ss l anticipates that it will significantly improve its cash flow 
while ss l will continue to build its orbital receivable balance  overall cash flow from operations in is expected to be positive  as the same satellite construction contracts that used cash in have significant milestone payments that become due during in addition  capital expenditures at ss l in are anticipated to be approximately million  significantly lower than the level reflecting substantial completion of its facility expansion 
ss l maintains the flexibility to defer 
table of contents or reduce a significant portion of its ongoing capital expenditures if the volume of ongoing business is materially reduced or as other circumstances may require 
during the first two months of  ss l repaid million of the million of outstanding debt on december  under the ss l credit agreement 
available credit and liquidity the ss l credit agreement  which is guaranteed pursuant to a parent guarantee agreement the parent guarantee  provides ss l with a million revolving credit facility  including a million letter of credit sublimit 
the ss l credit agreement matures on october   and is secured by the assets and common stock of ss l 
the ss l credit agreement contains certain covenants which  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  capital expenditures  investments  dividends or stock repurchases  asset sales  mergers and consolidations  liens  changes to the line of business and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
it also contains financial covenants whereby ss l must maintain a certain consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated interest coverage ratio 
ss l anticipates that over the coming year it will be in compliance with its financial covenants and have the full million available to it under the ss l credit agreement 
the parent guarantee limits the amount of dividends or other distributions to our stockholders that can be made by loral from the disposition of any capital stock of telesat holdings inc to the greater of i of the proceeds or ii the amount by which the proceeds exceed million 
ss l agreed to make up to million in loans to a customer  sirius satellite radio inc sirius  in the amended and restated customer credit agreement the sirius credit agreement relating to the construction of the satellites known as fm and fm the fm satellite and fm satellite  respectively 
as per this agreement  on december   the ability of sirius to reimburse itself for milestone payments previously paid permanently expired  and no amounts were outstanding thereunder 
in addition  as per the sirius credit agreement  given the timing of future milestone payments on fm and the date at which sirius availability to draw on fm milestone payments expires  loral anticipates that sirius will not be able to draw on future milestone payments owed on fm drawings under the sirius credit agreement would be secured by a first priority security interest in the fm satellite 
we currently believe that sirius does not meet all of the conditions precedent to draw under the sirius credit agreement  including the condition that sirius have a public market equity value of at least billion 
there can be no assurance that sirius will not meet such conditions in the future see note to the financial statements 
if sirius were to meet the conditions to draw on the credit agreement for fm it would have the ability to finance approximately million against future milestone payments 
as of february   sirius is current with all of its required milestone payments to ss l 
absent unforeseen circumstances  over the coming year ss l believes that with its cash on hand  cash flow from operations and availability under the ss l credit agreement  it has adequate liquidity to operate its business and finance loans contemplated by the sirius credit agreement 
satellite construction contracts often include provisions for orbital incentives where a portion of the contract value typically about is received over the to year life of the satellite 
receipt of these orbital incentives is contingent upon performance of the satellite in accordance with contractual specifications 
as of december   ss l has orbital receivables of approximately million  of which million is in current assets see note to the financial statements 
approximately million of these receivables are related to satellites in orbit and million are related to satellites that are under construction 
ss l expects to increase its orbital receivable asset by approximately million during continued growth in the satellite manufacturing business will result in a corresponding growth in the amount of orbital receivables 
current economic conditions could affect the ability of customers to make payments  including orbital incentive payments  under satellite construction contracts with ss l 
though most of ss l s customers are substantial corporations for which creditworthiness is generally high  ss l has certain customers which are either highly leveraged or are in the developmental stage and are not fully funded 
customers that are facing near term maturities on their existing debt also have elevated credit risk under current market conditions 
there can be no assurances that these customers will not delay contract payments to  or seek financial relief  from ss l 
if customers fall behind or are unable to meet their payment obligations  ss l s liquidity will be adversely affected 
as of 
table of contents december   such customers accounted for billed and unbilled accounts receivable of approximately million  orbital receivables of approximately million and backlog of million 
for the quarter ending march  ss l has received  and anticipates it will receive million from such customers 
there can be no assurance that ss l s customers  particularly those that ss l has identified as having elevated credit risk  will not default on their obligations to ss l in the future and that such defaults will not materially and adversely affect ss l and loral 
in the event of an uncured contract default by the customer  ss l s construction contracts generally provide ss l with significant rights even if their customers or successors have paid significant amounts under the contract 
these rights typically include the right to stop work on the satellite and the right to terminate the contract for default 
in the latter case  ss l would generally have the right to retain  and sell to other customers  the satellite or satellite components that are under construction 
however  the exercise of such rights could be impeded by the assertion by customers of defenses and counterclaims  including claims of breach of performance obligations on the part of ss l  and our recovery could be reduced by the lack of a ready resale market for the affected satellites or their components 
in either case  our liquidity could be adversely affected pending the resolution of such customer disputes 
ss l s contracts impose a variety of contractual obligations on ss l including the requirement to deliver the satellite by an agreed upon date  subject to negotiated allowances 
if ss l were unable to meet its contract obligations  including delivering the satellite at the agreed upon date in a contract the customer would have the right to terminate the contract for contractor default 
if a contract is terminated for contractor default  ss l would be required to refund the payments made to ss l to date  which could be significant 
in such circumstances  ss l would  however  keep the satellite under construction and be able to recoup some of its losses through the resale of the satellite or its components to another customer 
it has been ss l s experience that as the satellite is generally critical to the execution of a customer s operations and business plan such customers will usually renegotiate a revised delivery date with ss l versus terminating the contract for contractor default and losing the satellite 
nonetheless  the obligation to return all funds paid to ss l in the later stages of a contract  due to termination for contractor default  would have a material adverse effect on ss l s liquidity 
the current economic environment may also reduce the demand for satellites 
if ss l s satellite awards fall below  on average  four to five awards per year  ss l will be required to reduce costs and capital expenditures to accommodate this lower level of activity 
the timing of any reduced demand for satellites is difficult to predict 
it is  therefore  difficult to anticipate when to reduce costs and capital expenditures to match any slowdown in business 
a delay in matching the timing of a reduction in business with a reduction in expenditures could adversely affect our liquidity 
we believe that ss l s existing liquidity along with the availability under the ss l credit agreement are sufficient to finance ss l  even if we receive fewer than four to five awards in if ss l were to experience a shortage of orders below the four to five awards per year for multiple years  ss l could require additional financing  the amount and timing of which would depend on the magnitude of the order shortfall coupled with the timing of a reduction in costs and capital expenditures 
there can be no assurances that the ss l could obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency the company  in the normal course of business  is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

effectiveness is tested using regression analysis 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified to income in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects income 
any remaining gain or loss on the hedge is included in income 
on july   ss l was awarded a satellite contract denominated in euros and ss l entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts with maturities through to hedge the associated foreign currency exchange risk 
these foreign exchange forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of future euro denominated receivables 
during the year ended december   losses of million were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and were recorded as a reduction of revenue  and unrealized gains of million were included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the fair value of the cash flow hedges at december  was million of which million is included in other current assets and million is included in other assets

loral paid a premium of million for this option 
for the year ended december   loral recorded a charge of million  as the options expired unexercised on july  interest the company had million of borrowings outstanding under the ss l credit agreement at december  borrowings under this facility are limited to eurodollar loans for periods ending in one  two  three or six months or abr loans which rate is adjusted daily based upon changes in the prime rate of federal funds rate 
because of the nature of the borrowing under a revolving credit facility  the borrowing rate adjusts to changes in interest rates over time 
for a million credit facility  if it were fully borrowed  a change in interest rates would effect the company s interest expense by million for the year 
the company had no other long term debt or other exposure to changes in interest rates with respect thereto 
prior to the close of the telesat canada transaction in  loral skynet had debt at a fixed rate of
