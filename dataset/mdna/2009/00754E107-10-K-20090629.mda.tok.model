these forward looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including risks described in the risk factors sections and elsewhere in this filing

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the risk factors as well as our financial statements and the related notes 
application of critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make certain judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts could be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  warranty costs  taxes and contingencies 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and or as areas most dependent on management s judgments and estimates 
global economic conditions the credit markets and the financial services industry continue to experience a period of significant disruption characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions  increased volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability and a significant level of intervention from the united states and other governments 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term or widespread recession  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the global commercial and residential real estate markets and related mortgage markets and reduced consumer confidence have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for most developed and emerging economies continuing into as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies could restrict our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness  increase our costs of borrowing  limit our access to capital necessary to meet our liquidity needs and materially harm our operations or our ability to implement our business strategy 
revenue recognition revenue is derived principally from the sales of the company s products 
the company recognizes revenue when the basic criteria of staff accounting bulletin no 
are met 
specifically  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  usually in the form of a purchase order  when shipment has occurred since its terms are fob source  or when services have been rendered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured in terms of both credit worthiness of the customer and there are no post shipment obligations or uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
the company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides warranty repairs at no cost 
the length of the warranty term is one year from date of shipment 
the company accrues the estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical claim costs 
the company s management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or as other information becomes available 
the company does not provide price protection or general right of return 
the company s return policy only permits product returns for warranty and non warranty repair or replacement and requires pre authorization by the company prior to the return 
credit or discounts  which have been historically insignificant  may be given at the discretion of the company and are recorded when and if determined 
the company predominantly sells directly to original equipment manufacturers with a direct sales force 
the company sells in limited circumstances through distributors 
sales through distributors represent approximately of total revenue 
significant terms and conditions of distributor agreements include fob source  net days payment terms  with no return or exchange rights  and no price protection 
since the product transfers title to the distributor at the time of shipment by the company  the products are not considered inventory on consignment 
revenue is also derived from technology research and development contracts 
we recognize revenue from these contracts as services and or materials are provided 
impairment of long lived assets as of march  and march   our consolidated balance sheet included million in goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over amounts assigned to tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from our business acquisitions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test shall consist of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount  as defined 
sfas requires a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determine the fair value of our single reporting unit to be equal to our market capitalization plus a control premium 
market capitalization is determined by multiplying the shares outstanding on the assessment date by the average market price of our common stock over a day period before and a day period after each assessment date 
we use this day duration to consider inherent market fluctuations that may affect any individual closing price 
we believe that our market capitalization alone does not fully capture the fair value of our business as a whole  or the substantial value that an acquirer would obtain from its ability to obtain control of our business 
as such  in determining fair value  we add a control premium which seeks to give effect to the increased consideration a potential acquirer would be required to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to set policies  direct operations and make decisions related to our company to our market capitalization 
the company s evaluation as of march  and march   indicated there were no impairments 
as of march   our market capitalization  calculated as described above  was million and our carrying value  including goodwill  was million 
because market capitalization significantly exceeded our carrying value  our estimate of the control premium was not a determining factor in the outcome of step one of the impairment assessment 
for fy  our market capitalization calculated as described as above  had fallen to million and our carrying value  including goodwill  had decreased to million 
we applied a control premium to market capitalization to determine a fair value of million 
we believe that including a control premium at this level is supported by recent transaction data in our industry 
absent the inclusion of a control premium greater than for fy  our carrying value would have exceeded fair value  requiring a step two analysis which may have resulted in an impairment of goodwill 
as evidenced above  our stock price and control premium are significant factors in assessing our fair value for purposes of the goodwill impairment assessment 
our stock price can be affected by  among other things  changes in industry or market conditions  changes in our results of operations  and changes in our forecasts or market expectations relating to future results 
significant turmoil in the financial markets and weakness in macroeconomic conditions globally have recently contributed to volatility in our stock price and a significant decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter of fy our stock price has fluctuated from a high of to a low of during the fourth quarter of fy on numerous occasions during the fourth quarter  our stock price was high enough that our market capitalization exceeded our carrying value without giving effect to a control premium 
the current macroeconomic environment  however  continues to be challenging and we cannot be certain of the duration of these conditions and their potential impact on our stock price performance 
if our recent stock price decline persists and our market capitalization remains below our carrying value for a sustained period  it is reasonably likely that a goodwill impairment assessment prior to the next annual review in the fourth quarter of fiscal would be necessary and an impairment of goodwill may be recorded 
a non cash goodwill impairment charge would have the affect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period 
if we are required to take a substantial impairment charge  our operating results would be materially adversely affected in such period 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles and property and equipment  are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred relative to a given asset or assets 
impairment is deemed to have occurred if projected undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimated cash flows include management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
the amount of the impairment loss recognized is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its then estimated fair value 
the company s evaluation for the fiscal year ended march   indicated there were no impairments 
accounting for income taxes income tax provisions are provided for taxes currently payable or refundable  and for deferred income taxes arising from future tax consequences of events that were recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
the effects of income taxes are measured based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
as part our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our recent operating results and our forecasting process 
the company forecasts taxable income through its budgeting and planning process each year 
the process takes into account existing contracts  firm sales backlog  and projected sales based upon customer supplied forecasts of product purchases its design wins  company resources needed to fulfill these customers requirements  and extraordinary expenses that may be part of long term initiatives to increase shareholder value through revenue growth and efficiency improvements leading to profit improvement 
the company has substantial history  more than years in most cases  with its customers and its market on which its forecasts are based 
at march   our net deferred tax asset before consideration of a valuation allowance was approximately million  mainly consisting of net operating loss carry forwards which expire at various amounts over an approximate year period 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company has determined that at this time it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized  primarily due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards before they expire based on the negative evidence of its recent years history of losses  including tax losses in two of the last three years and cumulative taxable losses over the past three years  outweighing the positive evidence of taxable income projections in future years 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during those periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or within the periods before nol carry forwards expire 
as of both march  and  the company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets 
for the year ended march   we incurred taxable losses that increased our net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating our net deferred tax assets at march   we considered the negative evidence that we had taxable losses in each of the past three years 
because evidence such as our operating results during the most recent historical periods is afforded more weight than forecasted results for future periods  our recent losses and cumulative loss position during our most recent three year period represents sufficient negative evidence of the need for a full valuation allowance at march  inventories the company s inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost under the first in  first out method or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are reviewed throughout the year 
to calculate a reserve for obsolescence  we begin with a review of our slow moving inventory 
any inventory  which has been slow moving within the past months  is evaluated and reserved if deemed appropriate 
in addition  any residual inventory  which is customer specific and remaining on hand at the time of contract completion  is reserved for at the standard unit cost 
the complete list of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reviewed by the production  engineering and or purchasing departments to identify items that can be utilized in the near future 
these items are then excluded from the analysis and the remaining amount of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reserved for 
additionally  non cancelable open purchase orders for parts we are obligated to purchase where demand has been reduced may be reserved 
reserves for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price are also established 
if a product that had previously been reserved for is subsequently sold  the amount of reserve specific to that item is then reversed
