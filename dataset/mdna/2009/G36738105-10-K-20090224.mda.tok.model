item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the world s leading vertically integrated producers  marketers and distributors of high quality fresh and fresh cut fruit and vegetables  as well as a leading producer and marketer of prepared fruit and vegetables  juices  beverages and snacks in europe  africa and the middle east 
we market our products worldwide under the del monte brand  a symbol of product innovation  quality  freshness and reliability since our global sourcing and logistics system allows us to provide regular 
table of contents delivery of consistently high quality produce and value added services to our customers 
our major producing operations are located in north  central and south america  asia and africa 
production operations are aggregated on the basis of our products bananas  other fresh produce  prepared foods and other products and services 
other fresh produce includes pineapples  melons  tomatoes  non tropical fruit including grapes  apples  pears  peaches  plums  nectarines  apricots  avocados  and kiwis  fresh cut produce and other fruit and vegetables 
prepared foods include prepared fruit and vegetables  juices  beverages  snacks  poultry and meat products 
other products and services includes a third party ocean freight business  a plastic product and box manufacturing business and a grain business 
strategy our strategy is focused on a combination of maximizing revenues from our existing infrastructure  entering new markets and strict cost control initiatives 
we plan to continue to capitalize on the growing global demand for fresh produce and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
we expect sales growth of fresh produce in key markets by increasing sales volume and per unit sales prices as permitted by market conditions 
our caribana and melon farms acquisitions have substantially increased our production capability of bananas  pineapples and melon and provide the potential for significant operating efficiencies and synergies 
in addition  our number one position in the gold pineapple market has been further strengthened 
we plan additional investments in growth markets  such as the middle east  by adding distribution facilities and expanding our value added services 
we also plan to continue to increase production in our dubai fresh cut facility and expand the processed meat product offerings from our new jordan meat plant into other regional markets 
net sales our net sales are affected by numerous factors  including mainly the balance between the supply of and demand for our produce and competition from other fresh produce companies 
our net sales are also dependent on our ability to supply a consistent volume and quality of fresh produce to the markets we serve 
for example  seasonal variations in demand for bananas as a result of increased supply and competition from other fruit are reflected in the seasonal fluctuations in banana prices  with the first six months of each year generally exhibiting stronger demand and higher prices  except in those years where an excess supply exists 
during  generally  bananas were in short supply at certain times of the year  which contributed to a improvement in our worldwide per unit sales prices 
also contributing to this increase in banana per unit sales prices was the stronger euro and japanese yen as compared to the us dollar 
in addition  principally as a result of the caribana acquisition  we were able to increase banana sales volume by approximately 
in the processed foods business  we generally realize the largest portion of our net sales and gross profit in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
as a result of a continued short supply of industry volumes of canned pineapples during  we experienced higher per unit sales prices for this product 
since our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  our net sales are significantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we conduct our sales versus the dollar  with a weak dollar versus such currencies resulting in increased net sales in dollar terms 
including the effect of our foreign currency hedges  net sales for were positively impacted by approximately million  as compared to  principally as a result of a stronger euro and japanese yen  partially offset by a weaker british pound and korean won  versus the us dollar 
our net sales growth in recent years has been achieved primarily through increased sales volume in existing markets of other fresh produce  primarily pineapples  melons and non tropical fruit  and favorable pricing on our del monte gold extra sweet pineapple combined with increased sales volume of bananas in existing and new markets 
during  our sales growth was positively affected by higher sales volume of bananas and gold pineapples that resulted from our caribana acquisition 
also contributing to our sales growth has been the new products including tomatoes and prepared food  combined with expansion of value added services  such as banana ripening 
our net sales growth in recent years is also attributable to a broadening of our product line with the expansion of our fresh cut produce business and our expansions into new markets 
we expect our net sales growth to continue to be driven by increased sales volumes in our banana  other fresh produce and the prepared food segments 
as a result of our acquisitions and expansion of our production of banana  gold pineapple and melon operations  we expect an increase in net sales of these products in north america  europe and the middle east 
in the middle east  we expect net sales to increase due to increased sales of our fresh produce and prepared food product offerings 
we also expect to increase our sales by developing new products in the prepared food segment  such as various frozen juice stick bars and smoothie products  targeting the convenience store and foodservice trade in selected european and middle east markets 
cost of products sold cost of products sold is principally composed of two elements  product and logistics costs 
product cost for our produce is primarily composed of cultivation the cost of growing crops  harvesting  packaging  labor  depreciation and farm administration 
product cost for produce obtained from independent growers is composed of produce and packaging costs 
logistics costs include land and sea transportation and expenses related to port facilities and distribution centers 
sea transportation cost is the most significant component of logistics costs and is comprised of the cost of vessel operating expenses and chartering refrigerated vessels 
vessel operating expenses for our owned vessels include operations  maintenance  depreciation  insurance  fuel the cost of which is subject to commodity price fluctuations  and port charges 
for chartered vessels  operating expenses include the cost of chartering the vessels  fuel and port charges 
variations in containerboard prices  which affect the cost of boxes and other packaging materials  and fuel prices  can have a significant impact on our product cost and our profit margins 

table of contents containerboard  plastic  resin and fuel prices have historically been volatile 
during  the cost of fuel increased by and containerboard increased slightly as compared with and during fuel prices increased an additional and containerboard increased 
this increase in containerboard and fuel prices has added approximately million to cost of products sold in as compared to during  we also experienced a significant amount of cost increases on our products due to higher fertilizer and other raw material prices 
in general  changes in our volume of products sold can have a disproportionate effect on our gross profit 
within any particular year  a significant portion of our cost of products sold is fixed  both with respect to our operations and with respect to the cost of produce purchased from independent growers from whom we have agreed to purchase all the products they produce 
accordingly  higher volumes produced on company owned farms directly reduce the average per box cost  while lower volumes directly increase the average per box cost 
in addition  because the volume that will actually be produced on our farms and by independent growers in any given year depends on a variety of factors  including weather  that are beyond our control or the control of our independent growers  it is difficult to predict volumes and per box costs 
since our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  our costs are affected by fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we have significant operations versus the dollar  with a weak dollar versus those currencies resulting in increased costs 
during  cost of product sold was negatively impacted by approximately million as a result of a weaker us dollar versus the various currencies in which we have significant operations 
asset impairment and other charges asset impairment and other charges were million in as compared with million in  an increase of million 
in  we recorded asset impairment totaling million as a result of extensive flood damage at our banana farms in brazil and costa rica and million principally due to the closure of under utilized distribution centers and the previously announced closure of our beverage production operation in the united kingdom combined with related contract termination costs related to the banana and prepared food segments 
during  we also recorded a net benefit of approximately million related to the previously announced closing of our hawaii pineapple operations related to the other fresh produce segment 
asset impairment and other charges were million in as compared with million in  a decrease of million

in addition  as a result of the decision to exit all production activities in hawaii in  we recorded a net gain of million during related to the other fresh produce segment 
this net gain consists principally of a curtailment gain related to the us based post retirement health plan  partially offset by additional severance and other exit activity charges

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs associated with selling in countries where we have our own sales force  advertising and promotional expenses  professional fees  general corporate overhead and other related administrative functions 
interest expense interest expense consists primarily of interest on borrowings under working capital facilities that we maintain and interest on other long term debt primarily for capital lease obligations 
in  our average outstanding debt level decreased slightly  which  combined with lower interest rates  resulted in lower interest expense 
during  we expect to renew the credit facility 

table of contents other income  net other income  net  primarily consists of equity gains and losses in unconsolidated companies  together with currency exchange gains or losses and other miscellaneous income and expense items such as insurance recoveries and gain and losses from sales of investments and property  plant and equipment 
during  principally as a result of our disposal of non productive assets  we recorded gains of million from sales of property plant and equipment 
in addition  during  we recorded currency exchange gains totaling million that resulted primarily from favorable exchange rate movements in the euro  japanese yen and other currencies versus the us dollar 
during  we entered into derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments in order to minimize the impact of fluctuation in foreign exchange relative to the euro  british pound and japanese yen on our balance sheet  also referred to as economic hedges 
we recognized a net gain of million related to these derivative instruments included in the other income  net caption of our consolidated statements of income 
as of december   we did not have any economic hedges outstanding 
provision for benefit from income taxes income taxes consist of the consolidation of the tax provisions  computed on a separate entity basis  in each country in which we have operations 
since we are a non us company with substantial operations outside the united states  a substantial portion of our results of operations is not subject to us taxation 
many of the countries in which we operate have favorable tax rates 
we are subject to us taxation on our distribution and fresh cut operations in the united states 
from time to time  tax authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate audit our tax returns and review our business structures and positions and there are audits presently pending in various countries 
there can be no assurance that any tax audits  or changes in existing tax laws or interpretations in countries in which we operate  will not result in an increased effective tax rate for us 
we have established tax accruals for uncertain tax positions  including those relating to various tax audits currently in process 
the amount of income taxes due as a result of the eventual outcome of these audits may differ from the amount of estimated tax accruals
