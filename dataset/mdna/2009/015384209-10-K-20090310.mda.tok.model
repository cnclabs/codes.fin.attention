item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a pharmaceutical development company focused on the research  development  and commercialization of novel proprietary products for the acute treatment of central nervous system  or cns  conditions 
all of our product candidates are based on our proprietary technology  the staccato system 
the staccato system  vaporizes an excipient free drug to form a condensation aerosol that  when inhaled  allows for rapid systemic drug delivery 
because of the particle size of the aerosol  the drug is quickly absorbed through the deep lung into the bloodstream  providing speed of therapeutic onset that is comparable to intravenous  or iv  administration but with greater ease  patient comfort and convenience 
we currently have six product candidates in various stages of clinical development  ranging from phase through late stage phase in  our focus will be on the continued rapid development of az we have identified approximately drug compounds that have demonstrated initial vaporization feasibility for delivery with our technology 
we believe that a number of these drug compounds  when delivered by the staccato system  will have a desirable therapeutic profile for the treatment of acute and intermittent conditions 
we are initially focusing on developing proprietary products by combining our staccato system with small molecule drugs that have been in use for many years and are well characterized to create aerosolized forms of these drugs 
we believe that we will be able to reduce the development time and risks associated with our product candidates  compared to the development of new chemical entities 
our clinical stage product candidates are az staccato loxapine 
we are developing az for the acute treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder 
in we successfully completed two pivotal phase clinical trials and we project a new drug application  or nda  submission in the first quarter of az staccato loxapine 
we are developing az to treat patients suffering from acute migraine headaches 
az is a lower dose version of az az has completed a phase a in clinic study and we initiated an out patient phase b clinical trial in january az has been licensed to symphony allegro  and we have the right to repurchase all rights to this product candidate 
table of contents az staccato prochlorperazine 
we are developing az to treat patients suffering from acute migraine headaches 
during the third quarter of  we conducted an end of phase meeting with the fda 
we believe we have a clear understanding of the development requirements for filing an nda for this product candidate 
we do not intend to conduct any az phase studies without a partner  and we are continuing to seek partners for our staccato migraine product candidates  az and az az staccato zaleplon 
we are developing az for the treatment of insomnia in patients who have difficulty falling asleep  including patients who awake in the middle of the night and have difficulty falling back asleep 
az has completed phase testing 
we do not intend to conduct any az phase studies without a partner in az staccato fentanyl 
we are developing az for the treatment of patients with acute pain  including patients with breakthrough cancer pain and postoperative patients with acute pain episodes 
we have completed and announced positive results from a phase clinical trial of az in opioid na ve healthy subjects 
in december  we entered into a license  development and supply agreement  or the license agreement  with endo pharmaceuticals  inc  or endo  for az and the fentanyl class of molecules for north america 
under the terms of the license agreement  endo paid us an upfront fee of million  and was obligated to pay potential additional milestone payments of up to million upon achievement of predetermined regulatory and clinical milestones 
endo was also obligated to pay undisclosed royalties to us on net sales of the product  from which we would be required to pay for the cost of goods for the manufacture of the commercial version of the product 
under the terms of the license agreement  we had the primary responsibility for the development and costs of the staccato electronic multiple dose device and the exclusive right to manufacture the product for clinical development and commercial supply 
endo had the responsibility for future pre clinical  clinical and regulatory development  and  if az was approved for marketing  for commercializing the product in north america 
in january  we mutually agreed with endo to terminate the license agreement  with all rights to az reverting back to us 
we recorded the million upfront fee we received from endo in january as deferred revenue and began to recognize this revenue in the third quarter of over the estimated performance period of six years  resulting in revenue of  in our obligations under the license agreement were fulfilled upon the termination of the agreement  and we will recognize the remaining deferred revenue in the first quarter of we do not expect to pursue the development of az without a partner 
az staccato alprazolam 
az has completed a phase a proof of concept clinical trial for the treatment of panic attacks  an indication the company is not planning to pursue 
however  given the safety profile  the successful and reproducible delivery of alprazolam  and the iv like pharmacological effect demonstrated to date  we and symphony allegro are assessing az for other possible indications and renewed clinical development 
az has been licensed to symphony allegro  and we have the right to repurchase all rights to this product candidate 
in december  we entered into a transaction involving a series of related agreements providing for the financing of additional clinical and nonclinical development of az  staccato alprazolam  and az az  staccato loxapine 
pursuant to the agreements  symphony capital llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of symphony holdings llc  and its investors have invested million to form symphony allegro to fund additional clinical and nonclinical development of staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine 
we have exclusively licensed to symphony allegro certain intellectual property rights related to staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine 
we have retained manufacturing rights to these product candidates 
we continue to be primarily responsible for the development of these product candidates in accordance with a development plan and related development budgets  and we have incurred and may continue to incur expenses that are not funded by symphony allegro 
pursuant to the agreements  we have received an exclusive purchase option that gives us the right  but not the obligation  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the equity of symphony allegro  and reacquire the intellectual property rights that we licensed to symphony allegro 
this purchase option is exercisable at predetermined prices between million at march  and million at december  the purchase option exercise price may be paid for in cash or in a combination of cash and our common stock  in our sole discretion  provided that the common stock portion may not 
table of contents exceed of the purchase option exercise price or of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the purchase option closing date 
if we pay a portion of the purchase option exercise price in shares of our common stock  then we will be required to register such shares for resale under a resale registration statement pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement 
if we do not exercise our purchase option by december   then symphony allegro will retain its exclusive license to develop and commercialize staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine for all indications  and we will maintain exclusive rights to manufacture and sell staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine to symphony allegro or its sublicensee for those purposes 
pursuant to a warrant purchase agreement  we issued to symphony allegro holdings  llc a warrant with a five year term to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share  also paid a transaction structuring fee of million  and reimbursed approximately  of symphony allegro transaction fees 
we have retained all other rights to our product candidates and the staccato system 
we are seeking a partner in the united states for our lead product candidate  az  and intend to retain co promotion rights in the united states 
we eventually plan to build a united states based specialty sales force to commercialize our product candidates which are approved for marketing and which are intended for specialty pharmaceutical markets 
we plan to enter into strategic partnerships with other companies to commercialize products that are intended for certain markets in the united states and for all of our product candidates in geographic territories outside the united states 
in march  we obtained a committed equity line of credit under which we may sell  subject to certain limitations  up to million of our registered common stock to azimuth opportunity  ltd  or azimuth  over a month period 
we are not obligated to utilize any of the million equity line of credit 
we will determine  at our sole discretion  the timing  the dollar amount and the price per share of each draw under this equity line of credit  subject to certain conditions 
when and if we elect to use the equity line of credit  we will issue shares to azimuth at a discount between and to the volume weighted average price of our common stock over a preceding period of trading days 
azimuth is not required to purchase any shares at a price below per share 
any shares sold under this facility will be sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  on april  we have not sold any shares under this agreement as of december  in march  we sold  shares of our registered common stock to biomedical sciences investment fund pte 
ltd  or bio one  at a price of per share and issued a warrant to bio one to purchase up to million of additional shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the agreement contained certain conditions  in which bio one was eligible to receive  additional shares of our registered common stock and an adjustment to the exercise price of the warrant  which would adjust the effective purchase price paid or payable by bio one to per share 
we did not meet these conditions  and in january we issued bio one  additional registered shares of our common stock and the warrant s exercise price was automatically adjusted to give bio one the right to purchase  shares at a per share exercise price 
in addition  we committed to initiate and maintain manufacturing operations in singapore 
the warrant became exercisable only if we terminated operations in singapore or did not achieve certain performance milestones 
in december  we did not achieve a specified performance milestone  at which time the warrant became fully exercisable 
all securities sold to bio one were sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement declared effective by the sec on april  we were incorporated december  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  capital lease and equipment financings and government grants 
we have generated million in revenues from inception through december   substantially all of which was earned through united states small business innovation research grants and the agreement with endo 
we had  of revenues in and no revenues in in the third quarter of  we began to recognize revenues related to our endo license agreement 
in prior years we have recognized governmental grant revenue and drug compound feasibility revenue  however  we expect no grant revenue or drug compound feasibility screening revenue in in january  we and endo mutually terminated the license agreement  at which time we fully fulfilled our obligations under the agreement  and will recognize the remaining million of deferred revenues into revenues in the first quarter of we do not expect any material product revenue until at least 
table of contents we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our deficit accumulated during development stage was million and total stockholders equity was million 
we recognized net losses of million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
we expect our net losses to continue  however  at a lower rate than  as we continue our existing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials  reduce our research and development efforts  continue our manufacturing development  and begin commercialization development 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses in to slightly decrease from levels as we reduced our headcount in january and have otherwise sought to reduce expenses for items such as travel and outside consultancy 
the process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the development of our product candidates to be crucial to our long term success 
if we do not complete development of our product candidates and obtain regulatory approval to market one or more of these product candidates  we may be forced to cease operations 
the probability of success for each product candidate may be impacted by numerous factors  including preclinical data  clinical data  competition  device development  manufacturing capability  regulatory approval and commercial viability 
our strategy is to focus our resources on az we expect to file an nda for this product candidate in the first quarter of we have announced that we are seeking partnerships to continue development of our other programs 
if in the future we enter into additional partnerships  third parties could have control over preclinical development or clinical trials for some of our product candidates 
accordingly  the progress of such product candidate would not be under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to any future partnerships or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments  and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on developing our product candidates  we anticipate that we and our partners  will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
in january  we consolidated our operations to primarily focus our efforts on the continued rapid development of az as part of the reorganization  we reduced our total workforce by and we mutually agreed with endo to terminate our development agreement for our az product 
we anticipate that this consolidation will reduce operating expenses by million from the operating expenses 
we anticipate that with current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities along with interest earned thereon  expected payments from symphony allegro  the proceeds from option exercises  and purchases of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  we will be able to maintain our currently planned operations into the second quarter of changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant estimates and judgments in preparation of our financial statements 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals we estimate our preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on our estimates of the services received pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
preclinical study and clinical trial expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical studies  fees paid to contract research organizations and other clinical sites in connection with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of components and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we record accruals for these preclinical study and clinical trial costs based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses based on these estimates 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are entered in the trial 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and discussions with research institutions and organizations 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various preclinical studies and clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of preclinical study and clinical trial costs 
we make good faith estimates which we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risk and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
with the our ongoing phase clinical trial and future phase clinical trials  the process of estimating clinical trial costs will become more difficult as the trials will involve larger numbers of patients and clinical sites 
share based compensation on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
as required  we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method 
under this transition method  beginning january   compensation cost recognized includes a compensation cost for share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  related to i employees  based on the intrinsic value in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and ii non employees based on the options fair value in accordance with the provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and purchase rights issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant  reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting of the restricted stock unit 
our current estimate assumes no dividends will be paid prior to the vesting of the restricted stock unit 

table of contents through  we estimated the expected term of options using the simplified method  as illustrated in sab beginning in  we estimated the expected term of options based on the historical term periods of options that have been granted but are no longer outstanding and the estimated terms of outstanding options 
as we had been operating as a public company for a period of time that was significantly shorter than our estimated expected option term  we were unable to use actual price volatility data 
therefore  we estimated the volatility of our common stock based on volatility of similar entities through in we estimated the volatility of our stock based on our actual historical volatility since our initial public offering 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expenses in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further information regarding the sfas r disclosures 
symphony allegro  inc on december  we entered into a transaction involving a series of related agreements with symphony capital llc  or symphony capital  symphony allegro holdings llc  or holdings  and holdings wholly owned subsidiary symphony allegro  inc  or allegro  to fund the clinical development of az  staccato alprazolam  and az  staccato loxapine  or the programs 
symphony capital and other investors  together referred to as symphony  invested million in holdings  which then invested the million in allegro 
pursuant to the agreements  allegro agreed to invest up to the full million to fund the clinical development of the programs  and we licensed to allegro certain intellectual property rights related to these programs 
we have retained manufacturing rights to these product candidates 
pursuant to the agreements  we continue to be primarily responsible for all preclinical  clinical and device development efforts as well as maintenance of the intellectual property portfolio for the programs 
we and allegro have established a development committee to oversee the programs 
we participate in the development committee and have the right to appoint one of the five board of director seats of allegro 
we have incurred and may continue to incur expenses related to the programs that are not funded by allegro 
pursuant to the agreements  we have received an exclusive purchase option  or the purchase option  that gives us the right  but not the obligation  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the equity of allegro  and reacquire the intellectual property rights that we licensed to allegro 
the purchase option is exercisable at predetermined prices that increase over time and range from million starting december  to million through december  as of march  the purchase option is million 
the purchase option exercise price may be paid for in cash or in a combination of cash and our common stock  in our sole discretion  provided that the common stock portion may not exceed of the purchase option exercise price or of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the purchase option closing date 
if we pay a portion of the purchase option exercise price in shares of our common stock  then we will be required to register such shares for resale under a resale registration statement pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement 
if we do not exercise the purchase option by december   then allegro will retain its exclusive license to develop and commercialize staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine for all indications  and  if they are ultimately commercialized  we will maintain exclusive rights to manufacture and sell staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine to allegro or its sublicensee for those purposes 
in consideration for the purchase option  we issued to holdings a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share and paid million for structuring fees and related expenses to symphony capital 

table of contents under fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin r  a variable interest entity  or vie  is an entity that has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or an entity that has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the expected losses or do not receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
fin r requires a vie to be consolidated by the party that is deemed to be the primary beneficiary  which is the party that has exposure to a majority of the potential variability in the vie s outcomes 
the application of fin r to a given arrangement requires significant management judgment 
we have consolidated the financial position and results of operations of allegro in accordance with fin r 
we believe allegro is by design a vie because we have a purchase option to acquire its outstanding voting stock at prices that are fixed based upon the date the option is exercised 
the fixed nature of the purchase option price limits symphony s returns  as the investor in allegro 
fin r deems parties to be de facto agents if they cannot sell  transfer  or encumber their interests without the prior approval of an enterprise 
symphony capital is considered to be a de facto agent of ours pursuant to this provision  and because we and symphony  as a related party group  absorb a majority of allegro s variability  we evaluated whether  pursuant to fin r s requirements  we are most closely associated with allegro 
we concluded that we are most closely associated with allegro and should consolidate allegro because we originally developed the technology that was assigned to allegro  we will continue to oversee and monitor the development program  our employees will continue to perform substantially all of the development work  we significantly influenced the design of the responsibilities and corporate structure of allegro  allegro s operations are substantially similar to our activities  and through the purchase option  we have the ability to meaningfully participate in the benefits of a successful development effort 
symphony capital will be required to absorb the development risk for its equity investment in allegro 
pursuant to fin r s requirements  symphony capital s equity investment in allegro is classified as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
the noncontrolling interest held by symphony capital has been reduced by the million fair value of the warrant it received in consideration for the purchase option and million of fees we immediately paid to symphony capital upon the transaction s closing because the total consideration provided by us to symphony capital effectively reduces symphony capital s at risk equity investment in allegro 
while we perform the research and development on behalf of allegro  our development risk is limited to the consideration we provided to symphony capital the warrant and fees 
losses incurred by allegro are charged to the noncontrolling interest until that balance has been reduced to zero  at which point our net loss will be increased for the research and development expenses incurred subsequent to that date 
net losses incurred by allegro and charged to the noncontrolling interest were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   the noncontrolling interest balance was million 
as of december   the investments held by allegro were million  which we expect to spend during the period ending march  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas will require that noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries be reported as a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
sfas also requires that earnings or losses attributed to the noncontrolling interests be reported as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense  as well as requires disclosure of the attribution of consolidated earnings to the controlling and noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  if the purchase option expires unexercised  we would then be required to deconsolidate allegro 
that potential deconsolidation would not be expected to impact our earnings because the carrying value of the net assets of allegro would be expected to be zero 
in contrast  if we exercise the purchase option  we will retain control of allegro 
as such  we would expect to record the exercise of the purchase option as a return to the noncontrolling interest 
we do not expect to recognize an asset for the purchase option payment to be made to symphony 
instead  the payment is expected to be accounted for as a capital transaction that is  a return to the noncontrolling interest that would not affect our net income or loss 
however  because the exercise of the purchase option will be accounted for as a capital transaction  it will be treated as a deemed dividend for purposes of reporting earnings per share  increasing loss per 
table of contents share or decreasing income per share  as the case may be  in the period we exercise the purchase option 
if the programs are successful and the resources are available  we expect to exercise the purchase option 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revision of topic or sab in determining the accounting for collaboration agreements  we follow the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf eitf provides guidance on whether an arrangement involves multiple revenue generating deliverables that should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting or divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the arrangement represents a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy and the performance obligation period must be determined if not already contractually defined for the entire arrangement 
if the arrangement represents separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  a revenue recognition policy must be determined for each unit 
revenues for non refundable upfront license fee payments  where we continue to have obligations  will be recognized as performance occurs and obligations are completed 
we recorded the million upfront fee paid by endo as deferred revenue and began to recognize this revenue in the third quarter of through december   we have recognized  in revenue in connection with the endo upfront fee 
in january  we mutually agreed with endo to terminate the agreement 
upon the termination of the agreement all of the rights to az reverted to us 
we will recognize the remaining million payment as revenue in the first quarter of results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue

as a result  we believe reviewing our operating expenses both inclusive and exclusive of share based compensation provides a better understanding of the growth of our operations 
the impact of share based compensation on operating expenses is outlined as follows in thousands year ended december  non share based compensation expenses research and development general and administrative total non share based compensation expenses share based compensation expenses research and development general and administrative total share based compensation expenses total operating expenses 
table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities  as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing development efforts 
all research and development costs  including those funded by third parties  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigational sites where a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  third party supplier  consultant and employee related expenses  which include salary and benefits  facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies  and in  certain incremental charges related to officer loan extinguishments and non cash stock based compensation expense 
the table below sets forth our research and development expenses since january  and cumulative expenses for each of our lead product candidates based on our internal records and estimated allocations of employee time and related expenses year ended december  from december  inception through december  preclinical and clinical development in thousands az az az az az other preclinical programs total preclinical and clinical development research total research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increases were due primarily to increased spending on our az product candidates as we continued development of these product candidates under the symphony allegro agreement  including our first phase clinical trial of az which began enrollment in february and completed enrollment in june and our second phase clinical trial of az which began enrollment in july and completed enrollment in october  increased spending on our az product candidate as we continued development of this product candidate under the endo agreement  and increased research expenses as we increased our device development and manufacturing process scale up efforts 

table of contents these increases were partially offset by decreased spending on our az product candidate due to phase b clinical trial efforts and ongoing non clinical efforts occurring in  our az product candidate due to higher development and manufacturing efforts to modify the az device and manufacture clinical trial materials for the phase a trial in  and our az product candidate due to the preclinical and regulatory efforts in to support and prepare the ind filing that occurred in the fourth quarter of we expect that research and development expenses will decrease in as we expect lower clinical trial expenses for az az  a result of our completing two phase trials for az in we also expect lower employee related costs in  a result of our headcount reduction in the first quarter of we do not expect to expend any substantial amounts on az in we also expect our expenses for az  az  and az to be lower in as we do not intend to continue development of these programs unless we can partner the programs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility and information technology costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  patent related costs and professional fees for legal  consulting and accounting services 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increases were primarily due to increased staffing to manage and support our growth resulting in increased payroll and related expenses  increased third party intellectual property expenses as we continued to increase and maintain our intellectual property portfolio  and higher facilities expenses to support our growth 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses in to slightly decrease from levels due to a headcount reduction in january and our efforts to reduce expenses for items such as travel and outside consultancy 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  primarily represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities balances  and marketable securities held by symphony allegro 
interest and other income  net was million for and million for the decrease was primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and lower interest rates earned on such balances 
we expect interest income to continue to decrease in future periods as we expect our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances to decrease as we continue to incur net losses 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest on our equipment loans and was million in and million in the decrease was primarily due to decreases in our equipment loan borrowings as we made no additional borrowing under our equipment financing agreements in loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in symphony allegro

operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increases were due primarily to increased spending on our az and az product candidates as we continued development of these product candidates under the symphony allegro agreement  including the launch of a phase a clinical trial of az at the end of the second quarter of  and the increased spending on our az product candidate 
these increased efforts were partially offset by decreased spending on our az product candidate due to the completion of the phase b clinical trial in the first quarter of  our az product candidate  as we significantly reduced development on this program until we obtained a developmental partner  and our other preclinical development as we focused our efforts on our az product candidate

level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities
