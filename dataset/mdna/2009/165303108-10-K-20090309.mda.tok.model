executive overview chesapeake is a diversified utility company engaged  directly or through subsidiaries in natural gas distribution  transmission and marketing  propane distribution and wholesale marketing  advanced information services and other related businesses 
the company s strategy is focused on growing earnings from a stable utility foundation and investing in related businesses and services that provide opportunities for returns greater than traditional utility returns 
the key elements of this strategy include executing a capital investment program in pursuit of organic growth opportunities that generate returns equal to or greater than our cost of capital  expanding the natural gas distribution and transmission business through expansion into new geographic areas in our current service territories  expanding the propane distribution business in existing and new markets through leveraging our community gas system services and our bulk delivery capabilities  utilizing the company s expertise across our various businesses to improve overall performance  enhancing marketing channels to attract new customers  providing reliable and responsive customer service to retain existing customers  maintaining a capital structure that enables the company to access capital as needed  and maintaining a consistent and competitive dividend for shareholders 
the following discussions and those later in the document on operating income and segment results include use of the term gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes the purchased cost of natural gas and propane and the cost of labor spent on direct revenue producing activities 
gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
chesapeake believes that gross margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates the profitability achieved by the company under its allowed rates for regulated operations and under its competitive pricing structure for non regulated segments 
chesapeake s management uses gross margin in measuring its business units performance and has historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner

table of contents management s discussion and analysis chesapeake had a successful  in spite of the state of the global economic and financial markets 
for the year  net income increased by three percent as the company earned million in net income  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  earned in we were able to achieve this growth despite taking a charge of million in other operating expenses for costs related to an unconsummated acquisition 
absent this charge  the company estimates that  compared to  net income would have increased to million  or per share diluted 
the higher period over period net income was attributable primarily to our natural gas segment 
our natural gas transmission and distribution operations continued to invest capital in current growth initiatives that favorably positioned us for future growth as well 
these operations invested million in property  plant  and equipment during  primarily to expand our transmission and distribution systems 
these expansions were undertaken pursuant to additional long term firm transportation service contracts for our transmission operation and continued customer growth for the distribution operations 
collectively  these growth initiatives contributed million to gross margin in as a result of market conditions in the housing industry  the company continued to see a slowdown in the number of new houses being constructed 
despite this slowdown  the average number of residential customers served by our natural gas distribution operations increased by four percent 
while this growth percentage is lower than that experienced in recent years  it is still significantly above the national average 
pesco experienced a record year as gross margin increased by percent over this increase was achieved through enhanced sales contract terms  margins on spot sales of approximately  and a percent growth in its customer base 
a percent increase in its customer base contributed to a percent increase in volumes sold in the successful completion of rate proceedings for the company s natural gas transmission and delmarva distribution operations added  to gross margin in in addition  these rate proceedings provided for lower depreciation allowances and lower asset removal cost allowances  which contributed to the period over period decrease in depreciation expense and asset removal costs of million in propane price volatility during affected our wholesale marketing operation positively and our propane distribution operation negatively 
xeron capitalized on the price volatility  seizing opportunities to sell at prices above cost and to manage effectively the larger spreads between the market spot prices and forward propane prices experienced in  which contributed to the operation s percent year over year growth in gross margin 
in contrast  the volatility of wholesale propane prices had a negative impact on our propane distribution operations 
wholesale propane prices rose dramatically during the spring months of  when they are traditionally falling 
in efforts to protect the company from the impact that additional price increases would have on our pro cap propane price cap plan that we offer to customers  the propane distribution operation entered into a swap agreement 
by december   the market price of propane had plummeted well below the unit price in the swap agreement 
as a result  the company marked the agreement relating to the january and february gallons to market  which increased cost of sales by  for and resulted in the company adjusting the valuation of its propane inventory to current market prices in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
both of these adjustments reduced gross margin during by a total of million compared to the company subsequently terminated the swap agreement in january adverse economic conditions severely affected the advanced information services segment 
bravepoint experienced lower consulting revenues as customers began to conserve their information technology spending  resulting in a nine percent decline in billable hours in compared to in response to the instability and volatility of the financial markets  we increased the amounts of our committed short term borrowing capacity from million to million  while maintaining total short term line of credit capacity of million 
in addition  on october   the company executed a million long term debt placement of percent unsecured senior notes  maturing on october  page chesapeake utilities corporation form k

critical accounting policies chesapeake prepares its financial statements in accordance with gaap 
application of these accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingencies during the reporting period 
chesapeake bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since most of chesapeake s businesses are regulated and the accounting methods used by these businesses must comply with the requirements of the regulatory bodies  the choices available are limited by these regulatory requirements 
in the normal course of business  estimated amounts are subsequently adjusted to actual results that may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following policies require significant estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies and their application have been discussed with chesapeake s audit committee 
regulatory assets and liabilities as a result of the ratemaking process  chesapeake records certain assets and liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  consequently  the accounting principles applied by our regulated utilities differ in certain respects from those applied by the unregulated businesses 
costs are deferred when there is a probable expectation that they will be recovered in future revenues as a result of the regulatory process 
as more fully described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  chesapeake had recorded regulatory assets of million and regulatory liabilities of million  at december  if the company were required to terminate application of sfas no 
 it would be required to recognize all such deferred amounts as a charge or a credit to earnings  net of applicable income taxes 
such an adjustment could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
valuation of environmental assets and liabilities as more fully described in note n  environmental commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  chesapeake has completed its responsibilities related to one environmental site and is currently participating in the investigation  assessment or remediation of three other former manufactured gas plant sites 
amounts have been recorded as environmental liabilities and associated environmental regulatory assets based on estimates of future costs provided by independent consultants 
there is uncertainty in these amounts  because the united states environmental protection agency epa or other applicable state environmental authority may not have selected the final remediation methods 
in addition  there is uncertainty with regard to amounts that may be recovered from other potentially responsible parties 
chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis since the company s management believes that recovery of these expenditures  including any litigation costs  is probable through the regulatory process  the company has recorded  in accordance with sfas no 
 a regulatory asset and corresponding regulatory liability 
at december   chesapeake had recorded an environmental regulatory asset of  and a liability of  for environmental costs 
derivatives chesapeake may use derivative instruments to manage the price risk of its natural gas and propane purchasing activities 
the company continually monitors the use of these instruments to ensure compliance with its risk management policies and accounts for them in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  by recording their fair value as assets and liabilities 
if the derivative contracts meet the normal purchase and normal sale scope exception of sfas no 
 the related activities and services are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting 
the following is a review of chesapeake s use of derivative instruments at december  and the natural gas distribution and marketing operations  during and  entered into physical contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas  which qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under sfas no 
in that they provided for the purchase or sale of natural gas to be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the company over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  they were not subject to the accounting requirements of sfas no 
during and  chesapeake s propane distribution operations entered into physical contracts to buy propane supplies  which qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under sfas no 
in that they provided for the purchase or sale of propane to be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the company over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  the related liabilities incurred and assets acquired under these contracts were recorded when title to the underlying commodity passed 
during  but not during  the propane distribution operation entered into a swap agreement to protect the company from the impact of price increases on the pro cap propane price cap plan that we offer to customers 
the company considered this agreement to be an economic hedge that did not qualify for hedge accounting as described in sfas no 
at the end of the period  the market price of propane dropped below the unit price in the swap agreement 
as a result of the price drop  the company marked the agreement relating to the january and february gallons to market  which increased cost of sales in by approximately  in january  the company terminated this swap agreement 
chesapeake s propane wholesale marketing operation enters into forward and futures contracts that are considered derivatives under sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 open positions are marked to market using prices at the end of each reporting period and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of income as revenue or expense 
the contracts mature within one year and are almost exclusively for propane commodities  with delivery points at mt 
belvieu  texas  conway  kansas  and hattiesburg  mississippi 
management estimates the market valuation based on references to exchange traded futures prices  historical differentials and actual trading activity at the end of the reporting period 
commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period 
at december   these contracts had net unrealized gains of million that were recorded in the financial statements 
at december   these contracts had net unrealized gains of  that were recorded in the financial statements 
operating revenues revenues for the natural gas distribution operations of the company are based on rates approved by the pscs of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the natural gas transmission operation s revenues are based on rates approved by the ferc 
customers base rates may not be changed without formal approval by these commissions 
the pscs  however  have granted the company s regulated natural gas distribution operations the ability to negotiate rates  based on approved methodologies  with customers that have competitive alternatives 
in addition  the natural gas transmission operation can negotiate rates above or below the ferc approved tariff rates

table of contents for regulated deliveries of natural gas  chesapeake reads meters and bills customers on monthly cycles that do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
chesapeake accrues unbilled revenues for gas that has been delivered  but not yet billed  at the end of an accounting period to the extent that they do not coincide 
in connection with this accrual  chesapeake must estimate the amount of gas that has not been accounted for on its delivery system and must estimate the amount of the unbilled revenue by jurisdiction and customer class 
a similar computation is made to accrue unbilled revenues for propane customers with meters  such as community gas system customers 
the propane wholesale marketing operation records trading activity for open contracts on a net mark to market basis in the company s income statement 
the propane distribution  advanced information services and other segments record revenue in the period the products are delivered and or services are rendered 
chesapeake s natural gas distribution operations in delaware and maryland each have a purchased gas cost recovery mechanism 
this mechanism provides the company with a method of adjusting the billing rates with its customers for changes in the cost of purchased gas included in base rates 
the difference between the current cost of gas purchased and the cost of gas recovered in billed rates is deferred and accounted for as either unrecovered purchased gas costs or amounts payable to customers 
generally  these deferred amounts are recovered or refunded within one year 
the company charges flexible rates to its natural gas distribution industrial interruptible customers to compete with alternative types of fuel 
based on pricing  these customers can choose natural gas or alternative fuels 
neither the company nor the interruptible customer is contractually obligated to deliver or receive natural gas 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based upon our collections experiences  the condition of the overall economy and our assessment of our customers inability or reluctance to pay 
if circumstances change  however  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable may also change 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 
pension and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates  the level of contributions made to the plans  current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
the assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on the company s pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate  the assumed health care cost trend rate and the assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
additional information is presented in note l  employee benefit plans  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  including plan asset investment allocation  estimated future benefit payments  general descriptions of the plans  significant assumptions  the impact of certain changes in assumptions  and significant changes in estimates 
the total pension and other postretirement benefit costs included in operating income were   and  in  and  respectively 
the company expects to record higher pension and postretirement benefit costs in the range of  to  for the increased costs for represents the significant market decline in the values of the defined pension plan assets when compared to prior years 
actuarial assumptions affecting include an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent  consistent with the prior year  and discount rates of percent for each of the plans  compared with percent for the plans a year earlier 
the discount rates for each plan were determined by the company considering high quality corporate bond rates based on moody s aa bond index  changes in those rates from the prior year  and other pertinent factors  such as the expected life of the plan and the lump sum payment option

changes in working capital are determined by a variety of factors  including weather  the prices of natural gas and propane  the timing of customer collections  payments of natural gas and propane purchases  and deferred gas cost recoveries 
the company generates a large portion of its annual net income and subsequent increases in our accounts receivable in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to significant volumes of natural gas and propane delivered by our natural gas and propane distribution operations to customers during the peak heating season

the company evaluates whether to refinance existing debt or permanently refinance existing short term borrowing  based in part on the fluctuation in interest rates 
the company s propane distribution business is exposed to market risk as a result of propane storage activities and entering into fixed price contracts for supply 
the company can store up to approximately four million gallons including leased storage and rail cars of propane during the winter season to meet its customers peak requirements and to serve metered customers 
decreases in the wholesale price of propane may cause the value of stored propane to decline 
to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations  the company has adopted a risk management policy that allows the propane distribution operation to enter into fair value hedges of its inventory 
at december   the propane distribution operation had entered into a swap agreement to protect the company from the impact of price increases on the pro cap plan that we offer to customers 
the company considered this agreement to be an economic hedge that did not qualify for hedge accounting as described in sfas no 
at the end of  the market price of propane  valued using broker or dealer quotations  or market transactions in either the listed or otc markets  dropped below the unit price in the swap agreement

these contracts require that the propane wholesale marketing operation purchase or sell natural gas liquids at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of natural gas liquids to the company or the counter party or booking out the transaction 
booking out is a procedure for financially settling a contract in lieu of the physical delivery of energy

table of contents management s discussion and analysis competition the company s natural gas operations compete with other forms of energy including electricity  oil and propane 
the principal competitive factors are price and  to a lesser extent  accessibility 
the company s natural gas distribution operations have several large volume industrial customers that can use fuel oil as an alternative to natural gas 
when oil prices decline  these interruptible customers may convert to oil to satisfy their fuel requirements  and our interruptible sales volumes may decline because oil prices are lower than the price of natural gas 
oil prices  as well as the prices of electricity and other fuels  fluctuate for a variety of reasons  therefore  future competitive conditions are not predictable 
to address this uncertainty  the company uses flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales sides of this business to compete with alternative fuel price fluctuations 
as a result of the transmission operation s conversion to open access and the florida gas distribution division s restructuring of its services  these businesses have shifted from providing bundled transportation and sales service to providing only transportation and contract storage services 
the company s natural gas distribution operations in delaware  maryland and florida offer unbundled transportation services to certain commercial and industrial customers 
in  the florida operation extended such service to residential customers 
with such transportation service available on the company s distribution systems  the company is competing with third party suppliers to sell gas to industrial customers 
with respect to unbundled transportation services  the company s competitors include interstate transmission companies  if the distribution customers are located close enough to a transmission company s pipeline to make connections economically feasible 
the customers at risk are usually large volume commercial and industrial customers with the financial resources and capability to bypass the company s distribution operations in this manner 
in certain situations  the company s distribution operations may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business 
the company expects to continue to expand the availability of unbundled transportation service to additional classes of distribution customers in the future 
the company has also established a natural gas sales and supply management operation in florida  delaware and maryland to provide such service to customers eligible for unbundled transportation services 
the company s propane distribution operations compete with several other propane distributors in their respective geographic markets  primarily on the basis of service and price  emphasizing responsive and reliable service 
our competitors generally include local outlets of national distributors and local independent distributors  whose proximity to customers entails lower costs to provide service 
propane competes with electricity as an energy source  because it is typically less expensive than electricity  based on equivalent btu value 
propane also competes with home heating oil as an energy source 
since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane  propane is generally not distributed in geographic areas served by natural gas pipeline or distribution systems 
the propane wholesale marketing operation competes against various regional and national marketers  many of which have significantly greater resources and are able to obtain price or volumetric advantages 
the advanced information services business faces significant competition from a number of larger competitors having substantially greater resources available to them than does the company 
in addition  changes in the advanced information services business are occurring rapidly  and could adversely affect the markets for the products and services offered by these businesses 
this segment competes on the basis of technological expertise  reputation and price 
inflation inflation affects the cost of supply  labor  products and services required for operations  maintenance and capital improvements 
while the impact of inflation has remained low in recent years  natural gas and propane prices are subject to rapid fluctuations
