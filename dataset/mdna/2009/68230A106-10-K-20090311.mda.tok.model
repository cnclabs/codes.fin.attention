table of contents overview of the company oncogenex is a biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies that address unmet needs in the treatment of cancer 
the company has five product candidates in its pipeline  with each product candidate having a distinct mechanism of action and representing a unique opportunity for cancer drug development 
oncogenex product candidates ogx  ogx and ogx focus on mechanisms of treatment resistance in cancer patients and are designed to address treatment resistance by blocking the production of specific proteins which it believes promote survival of tumor cells and are over produced in response to a variety of cancer treatments 
oncogenex aim in targeting these particular proteins is to disable the tumor cell s adaptive defenses and thereby render the tumor cells more susceptible to attack with a variety of cancer therapies  including chemotherapy  which oncogenex believes will increase survival time and improve the quality of life for cancer patients 
product candidate sn is a novel camptothecin for the treatment of cancer 
camptothecins are potent anticancer agents that belong to the family of drugs called topoisomerase i inhibitors that bind reversibly to the topo i dna complex causing breaks in the dna strands during replication resulting in cell death 
product candidate csp is the lead compound from a family of compounds demonstrating activation of programmed cell death in pre clinical models that have been in licensed from bayer 
sonus was incorporated in october and oncogenex technologies was incorporated in may oncogenex has devoted substantially all of its resources to the development of its product candidates 
to date  oncogenex technologies has funded its operations primarily through the private placements of equity securities  and sonus has funded its operations primarily through private and public placements of equity securities 
neither company has ever been profitable 
the company incurred a loss for the year ended december  of million and has a cumulative loss of million since oncogenex technologies inception in through december  we require additional funding to support our planned operations  including our planned phase clinical trial of ogx in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer 
we may seek such additional funding through executing a partnership or collaboration agreement with a third party that has sufficient resources to fund the development of our product candidates  licensing agreement or sale of certain of our product candidates  private or public offerings of our equity securities  or debt financings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding on terms favorable to us  or at all 
in particular  the current widespread economic downturn  including the current tightening of credit in the financial markets  may adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate financing if we are successful in obtaining additional funding and initiating one or both of our phase clinical trials  then  unless the costs of development are borne by a third party pursuant to a partnership or collaboration agreement  we anticipate that our losses will rapidly increase  due primarily to the costs associated with phase clinical trials 
as noted earlier in this section  we have designed three possible phase clinical trials to evaluate the clinical benefit of ogx in crpc 
oncogenex believes that two of the three studies will be required for product marketing approval 
currently  oncogenex intends that the first line docetaxel with and without ogx will be combined with one of the second line clinical trials 
determination of which of the two second line studies will be conducted is dependent upon further discussions with the fda  and is subject to obtaining additional funding 
management believes that the company s existing personnel and facilities are sufficient to carry on existing development activities 
oncogenex is unable to predict when  if ever  it will be able to commence the sale of any of its product candidates 

table of contents revenues oncogenex has not generated any revenues from the sale of its products to date  and it does not expect to generate any revenues from licensing or product sales until it executes a partnership or collaboration arrangement or is able to commercialize its product candidates itself 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses consist primarily of costs for clinical trials  materials and supplies  facilities  personnel  including salaries and benefits  regulatory activities  pre clinical studies  licensing and intellectual property  and allocations of other research and development related costs 
external research and development expenses include fees paid to universities  hospitals and other entities that conduct certain research and development activities and that manufacture our product candidates for use in its clinical trials 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly in the future as we continue to develop our product candidates 
currently  we manage our clinical trials through independent medical investigators at their sites and at hospitals 
a majority of our expenditures to date have been related to the development of ogx until july   ogx was being co developed with isis  and r d expenses for ogx were shared on the basis of oncogenex and isis 
on july   oncogenex and isis amended their agreement to provide for unilateral development of ogx by oncogenex 
under the amended agreement  oncogenex is responsible for all development costs and activities for ogx we are required to pay to isis royalties for ogx ranging from to of net sales 
in addition  we will pay to isis of the upfront fees and milestone payments that we receive if we license ogx prior to initiation of registration trials  if we license ogx before of patients have been enrolled in a registration trial  if we license ogx prior to marketing approval from a regulatory authority and thereafter 
several of our clinical trials have been supported by grant funding which was received directly by the hospitals and or clinical investigators conducting the clinical trials allowing us to complete these clinical trials with minimal expense 
since our product candidates are in development  we cannot estimate completion dates for development activities or when we might receive material net cash inflows from our research and development projects 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for oncogenex personnel in executive  business development  human resources  external communications  finance and other administrative functions  as well as consulting costs  including market research and business consulting 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services  insurance and facility costs 
oncogenex believes that g a resources are sufficient to carry on existing development activities 
if we are successful in obtaining additional capital through licensing or through equity or debt financing and we initiate a phase clinical trial  we anticipate that g a expenses will increase significantly in the future as we continue to expand our operating activities 
restructuring activities as a requirement for the closing of the arrangement  sonus terminated the employment of two senior executives 
severance payable at the date of the arrangement was  and has been accounted for in accordance with eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination as part of the purchase price allocation 
the severance payable was settled following the completion of the arrangement and the amount owing at december  was nil 
on august   immediately following the completion of the arrangement  the company reduced workforce by approximately in order to implement cost savings measures to preserve cash while focusing on its highest potential product development programs 
severance payable at the date of the restructuring in connection with former employees of sonus was  and has been accounted for in accordance with eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination as part of the purchase price allocation 
the company estimates that all severance liabilities relating to transaction related workforce reductions will be paid out by october  and the amount owing at december  was  
table of contents prior to the arrangement  sonus entered into a non cancellable lease arrangement for office space located in bothell  washington  which is considered to be in excess of the company s current requirements 
we are actively seeking opportunities to lease or sublease the bothell facility 
the company has recognized a restructuring charge of  in relation to the estimated fair value of the liability remaining at december  with respect to excess facilities 
the liability is computed as the present value of the difference between the remaining lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses and has been accounted for in accordance with eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination as part of the purchase price allocation 
this represents the company s best estimate of the fair value of the liability 
subsequent changes in the liability due to accretion  or changes in estimates of sublease assumptions  etc 
will be recognized as adjustments to restructuring charges in future periods 
results of operations as discussed above  on august   sonus completed the arrangement with oncogenex technologies  whereby sonus acquired all of the outstanding preferred shares  common shares and convertible debentures of oncogenex technologies 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the arrangement as a reverse acquisition  whereby oncogenex technologies is deemed to be the acquiring entity from an accounting perspective 
for the year ended december   the consolidated results of operations of the company include only the results of operations of oncogenex technologies for the time period of january  through august  and the results of the combined company following the completion of the arrangement on august  the consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and december  include only the consolidated results of operations of oncogenex technologies and do not include historical results of sonus 
this treatment and presentation is in accordance with sfas  business combinations 
proforma results are included in note to the financial statements 
years ended december  and december  r d expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   which reflects an increase of million due mainly to costs associated with the development of ogx  an increase in employee expenses and higher facility costs both resulting from the reverse takeover of sonus 
g a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   which reflects a decrease of approximately thousand due mainly to higher costs associated with employee expenses and increased costs associated with operating as a public company  offset by higher costs incurred as part of a planned initial public offering in by oncogenex technologies which was later suspended 
interest income for the year ended december  was thousand compared to thousand for year ended december   which reflects an increase of thousand due mainly to an increase in cash equivalents and short term investments 
other for the year ended december  was thousand in income compared to thousand in expense for the year ended december   due to gains on sales of equipment  and foreign exchange gains 

table of contents years ended december  and december  r d expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   reflecting a decrease of million due mainly to lower manufacturing and preclinical costs for the development of ogx in the expenses included the cost to manufacture the first batch of ogx drug product and preclinical toxicology studies required before the drug could be administered to a patient in a clinical trial 
g a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase of approximately thousand due mainly to higher spending on expenses required to finance and expand the business 
interest income for the year ended december  was approximately thousand compared to approximately thousand for the year ended december   reflecting a decrease of approximately thousand 
the decrease is due to the reduction in cash balances available to be invested in interest and foreign exchange expense was a net expense amount of thousand for the year ended december  compared to a net expense amount of thousand for the year ended december  due mainly to foreign exchange and convertible debt interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources oncogenex has incurred cumulative losses of million since the inception of oncogenex technologies through december  oncogenex does not expect to generate revenue from product candidates for several years 
prior to the arrangement  sonus funded its operations through private and public offerings of common stock  and oncogenex technologies funded its operations primarily through the private placement of its preferred shares 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million were realized in august as a result of the arrangement 
as at december   oncogenex had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million in the aggregate as compared to million as at december  as at december   oncogenex does not have any borrowing or credit facilities available to it 
cash flows cash used in operations for the years ended december  and  net cash used in operations was million and million respectively 
this increase in cash used in operations in the year ended december  compared to the same period in was attributable primarily to increased r d expenses associated with personnel and facilities assumed in the arrangement  cash used to reduce liabilities assumed in the arrangement and increased current assets associated with r d activities 
the increase in cash used in operations in the year december  compared to the same period in was partly offset by cash provided by income tax credits recoverable recovered in compared to cash used in from an increase in that asset 
for the year ended december  the increase in income tax credits is a use of cash 
we expect that our cash used in operations for the year ended december  to be consistent with the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash used in operations of million was attributable primarily to oncogenex loss and an increase in investment tax credit recoverable of million  offset partly by an increase in taxes payable under part vi 
of the income tax act part vi 
tax of million and the interest on its convertible debentures of million 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations of million was attributable primarily to oncogenex loss  partly offset by an increase in taxes payable due to part vi 
tax of thousand 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  and  net cash provided by financing activities was thousand and million respectively 
all net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was the result of proceeds from the issuance of common shares on stock option exercises  offset by cash paid on the elimination of fractional shares following the one for eighteen reverse stock split 
all net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was due to the issuance of convertible debentures 
oncogenex had no cash provided  or used  by financing activities for the year ended december  cash used provided by investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  was due to the arrangement with sonus and transactions involving marketable securities in the normal course of business 
net cash provided by investing activities for the years ended december  and december  of million and million  respectively  was due primarily to maturities of investments 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements oncogenex believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund its currently planned operations through february  including completion of its ongoing phase clinical trials of ogx  completion of its phase clinical trial evaluating ogx as a monotherapy in patients with solid tumors  reaching an agreement with the fda via the special protocol assessment process spa on the design of a second phase registration trial evaluating durable pain palliation for ogx in combination with docetaxel as second line chemotherapy in patients with crpc  initiation of an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx treatment in patient with bladder cancer  and working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
we require additional funding to support our planned operations  including our planned phase clinical trials of ogx in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer 
we may obtain additional funding through executing a partnership or collaboration agreement with a third party that has sufficient resources to fund the development of our product candidates or the licensing or sale of certain of our product candidates  or through private or public offerings of our equity securities or debt financings 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our ability to obtain additional funding through executing a partnership or collaboration agreement with a third party that has sufficient resources to fund the development of our product candidates or the licensing or sale of certain of our product candidates  or through private or public offerings of our equity securities or debt financings  timing and costs of clinical trials  preclinical development and regulatory approvals  timing and cost of drug discovery and research and development  entering into new collaborative or product license agreements for products in our pipeline  and costs related to obtaining  defending and enforcing patents 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding on terms favorable to us  or at all 
our ability to obtain financing is particularly uncertain due to the current widespread economic downturn 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements within the required timeframe on terms favorable to us  we may be forced to curtail development activities and other operations or dispose of assets 
such events would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
in the event that such steps are not sufficient  or we believe that they will not be sufficient  we may be required to discontinue our operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  primarily in short term bank deposits  money market funds  and domestic and foreign commercial paper and government securities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars and are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  if market rates hypothetically increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels at december   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material 
foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions on certain contracts and payroll expenses related to our canadian subsidiary  oncogenex technologies  denominated in canadian dollars and we have not hedged these amounts 
as our unhedged foreign currency transactions fluctuate  our earnings might be negatively affected 
accordingly  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar might have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition  and fluctuations in exchange rates might harm our reported results and accounts from period to period
