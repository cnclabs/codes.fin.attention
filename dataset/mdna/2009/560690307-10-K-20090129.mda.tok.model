overview we are a provider of interactive entertainment products 
we sell our products primarily to large retail chains  specialty retail stores  video game rental outlets and distributors 
we also sell our products internationally through distribution agreements with other publishers 
we have developed our retail and distribution network over our year history 
we publish video game software for most major interactive entertainment hardware platforms  including nintendo s wii  game boy advance  or gba  ds  sony s playstation  or ps  and playstation portable  or psp  microsoft s xbox  xbox  the personal computer  or pc  and other mobile devices 
our video game titles are targeted at various demographics at a range of price points  from lower priced value titles to more expensive premium titles 
in some instances  these titles are based on licenses of well known properties  and in other cases based on original properties 
we collaborate and enter into agreements with content providers and video game development studios for the creation of the majority of our video games 

table of contents our business model and product strategy is primarily focused on games with relatively lower development costs for both console and handheld systems targeting mass market consumers 
we believe this strategy allows us to capitalize on our strengths and expertise while reducing some of the cost and risk associated with publishing a large number of premium console titles 
we continue to publish titles for popular handheld systems such as the ds and psp 
we also publish software for nintendo s wii console  as we believe this platform allows us to develop games within our cost parameters  while enabling us to reach mass market consumers 
in addition  we continue to look opportunistically for titles to publish on the pc and other home console systems 
we license rights to intellectual property used in our video games from third parties and work with third party development studios to develop our own proprietary video game titles 
in  we opened our own development studio to develop video games 
however  we expect to continue to use third party studios for the significant majority of our video game development 
net revenues 
our revenues are principally derived from sales of our video games 
we primarily provide video games for the mass market and casual game player 
our revenues are recognized net of estimated reserves for price protection and other allowances 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of product costs and amortization of software development costs and license fees 
a significant component of our cost of sales is product costs 
these are comprised primarily of manufacturing and packaging costs of the disc or cartridge media  royalties to the platform manufacturer and manufacturing and packaging costs of peripherals 
commencing upon the related product s release  capitalized software development and intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales 
gross profit 
gross profit is the excess of net revenues over product costs and amortization of software development and license fees 
development and license fees incurred to produce video games are generally incurred up front and amortized to cost of sales 
the recovery of these costs and total gross profit is dependent upon achieving a certain sales volume  which varies by title 
our value titles are generally characterized as having lower gross profit margin potential than premium titles as a result of their lower sales price and  carry lower financial risk associated with the recovery of upfront development and license fees as compared with premium game titles 
product research and development expenses 
product research and development expenses relate principally to our cost of supervision of third party video game developers  testing new products and conducting quality assurance evaluations during the development cycle as well as costs incurred at our development studio that are not allocated to games for which technological feasibility has been established 
costs incurred are employee related  may include equipment  and are not allocated to cost of sales 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist of marketing and promotion expenses  the cost of shipping products to customers and related employee costs 
a component of these expenses is credits to retailers for trade advertising 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily represent employee related costs  including corporate executive and support staff  general office expenses  professional fees and various other overhead charges 
professional fees  including legal and accounting expenses  typically represent the second largest component of our general and administrative expenses 
these fees are partially attributable to our required activities as a publicly traded company  such as sec filings 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs are directly attributable to our factoring and our purchase order financing arrangements 

table of contents provision benefit for income taxes 
utilization of our net operating loss nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
due to our history of losses  a valuation allowance sufficient to fully offset our nol and other deferred tax assets has been established under the provisions of sfas no 
 and this valuation allowance will be maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
seasonality and variations in interim quarterly results our quarterly net revenues  gross profit  and operating income are impacted significantly by the seasonality of the retail selling season  and the timing of the release of new titles 
sales of our catalog and other products are generally higher in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year ending january and october  respectively due to increased retail sales during the holiday season 
sales and gross profit as a percentage of sales also generally increase in quarters that we release significant new titles because of increased sales volume as retailers make purchases to stock their shelves and meet initial demand for the new release 
these quarters also benefit from the higher selling prices that we are able to achieve early in the product s life cycle 
for example  sales and gross profit during the three months ended january  benefited from strong holiday sales of our existing products  and the release of cooking mama for the ds 
therefore  sales results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for subsequent quarters during the fiscal year 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our product when title and risk of loss are transferred  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have no continuing obligations to the customer  and the collection of related accounts receivable is probable 
some of our software products provide limited online features at no additional cost to the consumer 
generally  we have considered such features to be incidental to our overall product offerings and an inconsequential deliverable 
accordingly  we do not defer any revenue related to products containing these limited online features 
however  in instances where online features or additional functionality is considered a substantive deliverable in addition to the software product  such characteristics will be taken into account when applying our revenue recognition policy 
reserves for price protection and other allowances 
we generally sell our products on a no return basis  although in certain instances  we may provide price protection or other allowances on certain unsold products in accordance with industry practices 
price protection  when granted and applicable  allows customers a partial credit with respect to merchandise unsold by them 
revenue is recognized net of 
table of contents estimates of these allowances 
sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received  such as the appearance of our products in a customer s national circular advertisement  are generally reflected as selling and marketing expenses 
we estimate potential future product price protection and other discounts related to current period product revenue 
generally our price protection for premium priced titles is higher than that needed for our value titles 
our reserves for price protection and other allowances fluctuate over periods as a result of a number of factors including analysis of historical experience  current sell through of retailer inventory of our products  current trends in the interactive entertainment market  the overall economy  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period 
however  actual allowances granted could materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions  technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of requests for allowances may increase as consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  this will result in a change in our reserves  which would impact the net revenues and or selling and marketing expenses we report 
for the twelve month periods ended october    and  we provided allowances for future price protection and other allowances of million  million  and million  respectively 
the fluctuations in the provisions reflected our estimates of future price protection based on the factors discussed above 
we do not have significant exposure to credit risk as we factor our receivables to a third party that generally buys our receivables without recourse 
software development costs and prepaid license fees 
we account for software development costs in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed fas 
software development costs include development fees  in the form of milestone payments made to independent software developers  and direct payroll and overhead costs for our internal development studio 
software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and management expects such costs to be recoverable against future revenues 
for products where proven game engine technology exists  this may occur early in the development cycle 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
amounts related to software development that are not capitalized are charged immediately to product research and development costs 
commencing upon a related product s release capitalized software development costs and prepaid license fees are amortized to cost of sales based upon the higher of i the ratio of current revenue to total projected revenue or ii straight line charges over the expected marketable life of the product 
prepaid license fees represent license fees to holders for the use of their intellectual property rights in the development of our products 
minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property licenses are initially recorded as an asset prepaid license fees and a current liability accrued royalties payable at the contractual amount upon execution of the contract or when specified milestones or events occur and when no significant performance remains with the licensor 
capitalized software development costs classified as non current relate to titles for which we estimate the release date to be more than one year from the balance sheet date 
licenses are expensed to cost of sales at the higher of the contractual royalty rate based on actual sales or an effective rate based upon total projected revenue related to such license 
when  in management s estimate  future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized costs  we expense these capitalized costs to cost of sales software development costs and license fees 
as of october   the net carrying value of our licenses and software development costs was 
table of contents million 
if we were required to write off licenses  due to changes in market conditions or product acceptance  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the amortization period for capitalized software development costs and prepaid license fees is usually no longer than one year from the initial release of the product 
if actual revenues or revised forecasted revenues fall below the initial forecasted revenue for a particular license  the charge to cost of sales may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter 
the recoverability of capitalized software development costs and prepaid license fees is evaluated quarterly based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate 
when  in management s estimate  future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized costs  we expense these capitalized costs to cost of sales 
significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs 
in evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs  the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred to complete and publish the product 
prepaid license fees and milestone payments made to our third party developers are typically considered non refundable advances against the total compensation they can earn based upon the sales performance of the products 
any additional royalty or other compensation earned beyond the milestone payments is expensed to cost of sales as incurred 
inventory 
inventory  which consists principally of finished goods  is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we estimate the net realizable value of slow moving inventory on a title by title basis and charge the excess of cost over net realizable value to cost of sales 
accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted sfas r on november  using the modified prospective transition method  which requires that compensation cost be recognized for all awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date as well as for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested as of the effective date 
commitments and contingencies 
we account for commitments and contingencies in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we record a liability for commitments and contingencies when the amount is both probable and reasonably estimable

net revenues for the year ended october  increased to million from million in the comparable period last year 
the million increase is primarily due to increased revenue from a greater number of new releases for the nintendo wii platform from two in to nine in  and the release of cooking mama for the nintendo ds 
the addition of this new title  in addition to continued re orders for our previously released titles  cooking mama for the nintendo ds and cooking 
table of contents mama cook off for the nintendo wii  have led to increased revenues for the franchise overall  when compared to the prior year 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended october  was million compared to a gross profit of million in the same period last year 
the increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to the higher net revenues discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended october  compared to for the year ended october  the increase in gross profit is attributable to a higher gross margin on new releases and the impact of million of revenues related to the satisfaction of minimum purchase commitments for our dance dance revolution or ddr  dance mat product  for which there was no cost of sales 
product research and development expenses 
research and development costs increased million to million for the year ended october  from million for the comparable period in the increase is the result of the opening of our new development studio  additional testers to support growth in our product lineup and personnel to support our internet based initiatives 
we capitalized approximately million of expenses related to the internal development of video games for year ended october  selling and marketing expenses 
total selling and marketing expenses increased from million for the year ended october  to million for the year ended october  the increase is primarily due to higher media costs associated with the release of new titles  and variable fulfillment and sales commission expenses related to higher sales during the year ended october  as compared to selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was approximately and for the year ended october  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended october  general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of million from million in the comparable period in the increase is primarily due to higher compensation expenses resulting from incentive compensation plans and a charge to bad debt expense of million related to the bankruptcy of the circuit city retail chain 
our incentive compensation plan is primarily based on net income generated by the company 
during we generated a net loss  resulting in lower incentive compensation expense 
general and administrative excpenses include million and million of non cash compensation expenses for the year ended october  and  respectively 
settlement of litigation and related charges  net 
on september   we entered into settlement agreements to settle the following litigations pending in the united states district court  district of new jersey i a securities class action brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our securities  ii a private securities action filed by trinad capital master fund  ltd  and iii a second action filed by trinad  purportedly on behalf of the company

under the terms of the settlement agreement in the securities class action  as amended  which is subject to notice to the shareholder claimants and court approval  our insurance carrier will make a cash payment  we will make cash payments of  in january and  in may and we will contribute one million shares of our common stock 
the shares being contributed to the settlement will be distributed to the settlement claimants if and when the court grants final approval of the settlement and the settlement becomes effective 
during the twelve months ended october   we recorded a million charge in connection with the expected settlement of the class action litigation  based on the terms of the original settlement 
the charge is comprised of million  representing the fair value  on the date the agreement was executed  of the common stock expected to be distributed when the settlement becomes effective and million 
table of contents representing the increase in the value of the shares since that date 
during the year ended october   we recorded a gain on litigation settlement of million representing the decline in the value of the shares to be issued under the settlement  as if it occurred on october  the estimated settlement liability was adjusted at october   to reflect the terms of the amended settlement agreement entered into on january  accordingly an additional gain on settlement of litigation of million was recorded during the year ended october  the total estimated liability at october  is million  comprised of the million in cash payments  and million representing million shares of common stock at the closing market price of at that date 
the value of the common stock on the date the shares are issued may be different than  resulting in further adjustment to the settlement liability 
the settlement of the private securities claim in the action brought by trinad  on its own behalf  provides that our insurance carrier will make a cash payment to trinad  subject to final approval of the class action settlement by the court 
the settlement agreement in the action filed by trinad  purportedly on behalf of the company  will not result in a payment to us 
plaintiff s attorneys will not receive any fees in connection with the settlement 
as a result of the filing of this lawsuit by trinad  we have taken actions which it and trinad believe will benefit the company s shareholders and address some of the issues raised in the lawsuit 
this settlement is subject to notice to the company s shareholders and to court approval 
since the settlements are subject to notice to shareholders and to court approval  there is no assurance that the settlements described above will be consummated 
further if these settlements are not achieved  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to cover our costs relating to these litigations 
any expenses incurred in connection with such litigation not covered by available insurance or any adverse resolution of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
as previously disclosed  on july   charlie bolton filed a complaint against the company and several current and former directors and officers of the company in the united states district court for the district of new jersey 
the allegations in the complaint are similar to those in the class action and trinad capital s action against the company and several current and former directors and officers discussed above 
on september   the company entered into a settlement with bolton providing for a cash payment from insurance proceeds and the action has been dismissed  with prejudice 
there is no assurance that the settlement described above will be achieved  and if not achieved  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to cover our costs relating to the litigation

operating income loss 
operating income for the year ended october  was million  compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended october  the increase in operating income primarily resulted from the impact of the higher net revenue  higher gross profit  and decrease in settlement of litigation charges  partially offset by the increased operating expenses also discussed above 
interest and financing costs  net 
interest and financing costs decreased to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  the decrease of million is the result of a lower percentage of our inventory purchases being financed through letters of credit as a result of an equity financing completed in september  and lower factoring fees 

table of contents change in fair value of warrants 
on september  we issued warrants in connection with an equity financing 
the warrants contain a provision that may require settlement by transferring assets 
therefore  they are recorded at fair value as liabilities in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and fasb staff position issuers accounting for freestanding financial instruments composed of more than one option or forward contract embodying obligations under fasb statement we recorded income of million for the year ended october   reflecting the decrease in fair value of the warrants during that period 
income taxes

net income loss 
net income for the year ended october  was million  an increase of million from a net loss of million for the comparable period in this increase is primarily due to the increased operating income  the reduction in settlement of litigation and related charges  net  the reduction of net interest and financing expenses and the change in fair value of warrants discussed above

product research and development expenses 
research and development costs decreased million to million for the year ended october  from million for the comparable period in the decrease is principally the result of a reduction in the number of quality assurance employees in january  as we changed our focus to games with shorter development times and relatively lower development costs 
selling and marketing expenses 
total selling and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended october  from million for the same period in the million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in media and other marketing costs associated with premium games that were launched in the quarter ended january  in addition  the variable selling and marketing costs such as commissions  also decreased due to lower revenues in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was approximately for the year ended october   compared to in the prior year

table of contents change in fair value of warrants 
as discussed in note to our financial statements  we recorded income of million for the twelve months ended october   reflecting the decrease in fair value of warrants issued in connection with a private placement of our equity securities in september income taxes 
we did not record any income tax benefit because realization of the resulting loss carryforwards cannot be assured 
net loss

liquidity and capital resources we generated net income of million in however  we incurred a net loss of million in historically  we have funded our operating losses through sales of our equity and use of our purchase order financing and factor arrangements 
we raised approximately million in gross proceeds from the sale of our equity securities in september our current plan is to fund our operations through product sales 
however  we may be required to modify that plan  or seek outside sources of financing if our operating plan and sales targets are not met 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event that we are unable to negotiate alternative financing  or negotiate terms that are acceptable to us  we may be forced to modify our business plan materially  including making more reductions in game development and other expenditures 
management believes it can operate under the existing level of financing for at least one year 
however  if the current level of financing was reduced and we were unable to obtain alternative financing  it could create a material adverse change in the business 
while our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of october   we expect continued volatility in the use and availability of cash due to the seasonality of our business  timing of receivables collections and working capital needs necessary to finance our business and growth objectives 
to satisfy our liquidity needs  we factor our receivables 
we also utilize purchase order financing through the factor and through a finance company to provide funding for the manufacture of our products 
in connection with these arrangements  the finance company and the factor have a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
under our factoring agreement we have the ability to take cash advances against accounts receivable and inventory of up to million  and the availability of up to million in letters of credit 
the factor  in its sole discretion  can reduce the availability of financing at anytime 
in addition  we have million of availability for letters of credit and purchase order financing with another lender 
factoring and purchase order financing 
as mentioned above  to provide liquidity  we take advances from our factor and utilize purchase order financing to fund the manufacturing of our products 
under the terms of our factoring agreement  we assign our accounts receivable to the factor 
the factor  in its sole discretion  determines whether or not it will accept a receivable based on its assessment of its credit risk 
once a receivable is accepted by the factor  the factor assumes substantially all of the credit risk associated with the receivable 
the factor is required to remit payments to us for the assigned accounts receivable in accordance with the terms of the assigned invoice  regardless of whether the factor receives payment on the receivable  so long as the customer does not have a valid dispute related to the invoice 
the amount remitted to us by the factor equals the invoiced amount adjusted for allowances and discounts we have provided to the customer less factor charges of of invoiced amounts for these credit and 
table of contents collection services 
in certain cases  we assign accounts receivable to the factor to provide collection services and to serve as collateral for advances  however  the company retains the credit risk 
manufacturers require us to present a letter of credit  or pay cash in advance  in order to manufacture the products required under a purchase order 
currently  we utilize letters of credit either from a finance company or our factor 
the finance company charges of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days  plus administrative fees 
our factor provides purchase order financing at a cost of of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days 
additional charges are incurred if letters of credit remain outstanding in excess of the original time period and or the financing company is not paid at the time the products are received 
when our liquidity position allows  we will pay cash in advance instead of utilizing purchase order financing 
this results in reduced financing and administrative fees associated with purchase order financing 
in addition  we may request that the factor provide us with cash advances based on our accounts receivable and inventory 
the factor may either accept or reject our request for advances at its discretion 
amounts to be paid to us by the factor for any assigned receivable are offset by any amounts previously advanced by the factor 
as our needs require  we may request that the factor advance of the eligible receivables  and advance of inventory up to a maximum of million 
the interest rate is prime plus 
in certain circumstances  an additional is charged for advances against inventory 
advances from customers 
on a case by case basis  distributors and other customers have agreed to provide us with cash advances on their orders 
these advances are then applied against future sales to these customers 
in exchange for these advances  we offer these customers beneficial pricing or other considerations
