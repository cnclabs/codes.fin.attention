item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of atlantic american corporation atlantic american or the parent and its subsidiaries collectively  the company for each of the three years in the period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
atlantic american is an insurance holding company whose operations are conducted primarily through its insurance subsidiaries american southern insurance company and american safety insurance company together known as american southern and bankers fidelity life insurance company bankers fidelity 
each operating company is managed separately  offers different products and is evaluated on its individual performance 
in december  the company entered into an agreement for the sale of its regional property and casualty operations  association casualty insurance company and association risk management general agency  inc together known as association casualty and georgia casualty surety company georgia casualty to columbia mutual insurance company 
the company completed this sale on march  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the consolidated financial statements reflect the assets  liabilities and operating results of the regional property and casualty operations as discontinued operations 
accordingly  unless otherwise noted  amounts and analyses contained herein reflect the continuing operations of the company and exclude the regional property and casualty operations 
references to income and loss from operations are identified as continuing operations or discontinued operations  while references to net income or net loss reflect the consolidated net results of both continuing and discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and  in management s belief  conform to general practices within the insurance industry 
the following is an explanation of the company s accounting policies and the resultant estimates considered most significant by management 
these accounting policies inherently require significant judgment and assumptions and actual operating results could differ significantly from management s initial estimates determined using these policies 
atlantic american does not expect that changes in the estimates determined using these policies will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity  although changes could have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  this obligation includes estimates for unpaid losses on claims reported prior to december   development on those reported claims  unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported and unpaid loss adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred prior to december  quantification of loss estimates for each of these components involves a significant degree of judgment and estimates may vary  materially  from period to period 
estimated unpaid losses on reported claims are developed based on historical experience with similar claims by the company 
development on reported claims  estimates of unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported  and estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses  are developed based on the company s historical experience  using actuarial methods to assist in the analysis 
the company s actuary develops ranges of estimated development on reported and unreported claims as well as loss adjustment expenses using various methods including the paid loss development method  the reported loss development method  the paid bornhuetter ferguson method and the reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
any single method used to estimate ultimate losses has inherent advantages and disadvantages due to the trends and changes affecting the business environment and the company s administrative policies 
further  a variety of external factors  such as legislative changes  medical cost inflation  and others may directly or indirectly impact the relative adequacy of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the company s approach is to select an estimate of ultimate losses based on comparing results of a variety of reserving methods  as opposed to total reliance on any single method 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment 
table of contents expenses are reviewed periodically for significant lines of business  and when current results differ from the original assumptions used to develop such estimates  the amount of the company s recorded liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is adjusted 
in the event the company s actual reported losses in any period are materially in excess of the previous estimated amounts  such losses  to the extent reinsurance coverage does not exist  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
future policy benefits comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  these liabilities relate primarily to life insurance products and are based upon assumed future investment yields  mortality rates  and withdrawal rates after giving effect to possible risks of adverse deviation 
the assumed mortality and withdrawal rates are based upon the company s experience 
if actual results differ from the initial assumptions  the amount of the company s recorded liability could require adjustment 
deferred acquisition costs comprised of the company s total assets at december  deferred acquisition costs are commissions  premium taxes  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal business and are generally deferred and amortized 
the deferred amounts are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to expense in a systematic manner 
traditional life insurance and long duration health insurance deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing the related liability for policy benefit reserves 
the deferred acquisition costs for property and casualty insurance and short duration health insurance are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs are expensed when such costs are deemed not to be recoverable from future premiums for traditional life and long duration health insurance and from the related unearned premiums and investment income for property and casualty and short duration health insurance 
assessments of recoverability for property and casualty and short duration health insurance are extremely sensitive to the estimates of a subsequent year s projected losses related to the unearned premiums 
projected loss estimates for a current block of business for which unearned premiums remain to be earned may vary significantly from the indicated losses incurred in any given previous calendar year 
receivables are amounts due from reinsurers  insureds and agents and comprised of the company s total assets at december  insured and agent balances are evaluated periodically for collectibility 
annually  the company performs an analysis of the credit worthiness of the company s reinsurers using various data sources 
failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations due to insolvencies or disputes could result in uncollectible amounts and losses to the company 
allowances for uncollectible amounts are established  as and when a loss has been determined probable  against the related receivable 
losses are recognized when determined on a specific account basis and a general provision for loss is made based on the company s historical experience 
cash and investments comprised of the company s total assets at december  substantially all investments are in bonds and common and preferred stocks  the values of which are subject to significant market fluctuations 
the company carries all investments as available for sale and  accordingly  at their estimated fair values 
the company has certain fixed maturity securities that do not have publicly quoted values with an estimated fair value as determined by management of million at december  such values inherently involve a greater degree of judgment and uncertainty and therefore ultimately greater price volatility 
on occasion  the value of an investment may decline to a value below its amortized purchase price and remain at such value for an extended period of time 
when an investment s indicated fair value has declined below its cost basis for a period of time  the company evaluates such investment for other than a temporary impairment 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties in the determination of whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  an issuer s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates 
in evaluating impairment  the company considers  among other factors  the intent and ability to hold these securities  the nature of the investment and the prospects for the issuer and its industry  the issuers continued satisfaction of the investment obligations in accordance with their contractual terms  and management s expectation that they will continue to do so  as well as rating actions that affect the issuer s credit status 
if other than a temporary impairment is deemed to exist  then the company will write down the 
table of contents amortized cost basis of the investment to its estimated fair value 
while such write down does not impact the reported value of the investment in the company s balance sheet  it is reflected as a realized investment loss in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of the company s review of its investment portfolio  impairment charges of million related to the write down in the value of certain bonds  preferred and common stocks were recorded during see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective january   on a prospective basis  the company determined the fair values of certain financial instruments based on the fair market hierarchy established in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange price at which an asset could be sold or a liability settled in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
sfas provides guidance on measuring fair value when required under existing accounting standards and establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques 
the first level of such hierarchy determines fair value at the quoted price unadjusted in active markets for identical assets level 
the second level determines fair value using valuation methodology including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly for substantially similar terms level 
the third level for determining fair value utilizes inputs to valuation methodology which are unobservable for the asset or liability level 
such values inherently involve a greater degree of judgment and uncertainty and therefore ultimately greater price volatility 
a financial asset s or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the fair values for fixed maturity and equity securities are largely determined by either independent methods prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  which do not differ materially from nationally quoted market prices  when available  or independent broker quotations 
the company s level instruments consist of short term investments 
the company s level instruments include most of its fixed maturity securities  which consist of us treasury securities and us government securities  municipal bonds  and certain corporate fixed maturity securities as well as its common and non redeemable preferred stocks 
the company s level instruments include certain fixed maturity securities and a zero cost rate collar 
fair value is based on criteria that use assumptions or other data that are not readily observable from objective sources 
as of december   the company s fixed maturity securities valued using level criteria totaled million and the zero cost rate collar was a liability of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes comprised approximately of the company s total assets at december  deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for tax purposes 
these deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies

table of contents overall corporate results year ended december  in thousands revenue property and casualty american southern life and health bankers fidelity corporate and other total revenue income loss from continuing operations before income taxes property and casualty american southern life and health bankers fidelity corporate and other income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss on a consolidated basis  the company had a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in loss from continuing operations was million in  compared with income from continuing operations of million in and million in  while the loss from discontinued operations was million in  compared to loss from discontinued operations of million in and income from discontinued operations of million in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes was million in  compared to income from continuing operations before income taxes of million in and million in the loss from continuing operations in was primarily due to a million realized loss related to the write down in the value of certain bonds  preferred and common stocks due to an other than temporary impairment 
the company had net realized investment losses of million in  compared to net realized investment gains of million in and million in in  the company disposed of a significant holding in wachovia corporation which resulted in realized investment gains totaling million 
such variations between years in realized investment gains and losses significantly influence the reported income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
income from continuing operations before income taxes and realized investment gains and losses was million in and was million in both and the magnitude of realized investment gains and losses in any year are a function of the timing of trades of investments relative to the markets themselves as well as the recognition of any impairments on investments 
total revenue was million in as compared to million in and million in insurance premiums decreased to million in from million in and million in the continued softening in the property and casualty markets combined with the significant market competition in the medicare supplement and medicare advantage markets have resulted in declining premiums in both of the company s business segments between years  although premium levels at the end of appeared to be stabilizing 
premium declines were not as evident in the change in total revenue during due to the magnitude of the change in realized investment gains in 
table of contents total expenses have decreased consistent with the related premium decreases  although not directly proportionate 
insurance benefits and losses and commissions and underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums were  and in  and  respectively 
the company s property and casualty operations are comprised of american southern and the company s life and health operations consist of bankers fidelity 
a more detailed analysis of the operating companies and other corporate activities is provided below 
underwriting results american southern the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  american southern s premiums  losses  expenses and underwriting ratios year ended december  dollars in thousands gross written premiums ceded premiums net written premiums net earned premiums net losses and loss adjustment expenses underwriting expenses underwriting income loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio gross written premiums at american southern increased million  or  during as compared to the increase in gross written premiums was primarily attributable to a significant increase in commercial automobile business generated by a newly appointed agency 
partially offsetting this increase in gross written premiums were decreases in both the general liability and property lines of business due to the weak construction industry  particularly in the state of florida 
ceded premiums decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in ceded premiums was primarily due to the decline in the related earned premiums 
as american southern s premiums are determined and ceded as a percentage of earned premiums  a decrease in ceded premiums occurs when earned premiums decrease 
gross written premiums at american southern decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in gross written premiums was primarily attributable to the loss of one program marketed through a general agent which prior to had annualized gross written premiums exceeding million per annum 
loss of the program resulted from a larger competitor offering a broader coverage on a national basis to the insured 
ceded premiums decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in ceded premiums was primarily due to the decline in the related earned premiums 

table of contents the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  american southern s earned premiums by line of business year ended december  in thousands automobile liability automobile physical damage general liability property surety total earned premium net earned premiums decreased million  or  during as compared to and million  or  during as compared to the decrease in net earned premiums during was primarily due to the decline in policy writings in during  american southern experienced a significant decrease in gross written premiums  which was primarily attributable to the loss of a program marketed through a certain general agent 
prior to  this program produced approximately million in annualized gross written premiums  substantially all of which were earned through the decrease in net earned premiums during was primarily attributable to the cancellation of american southern s joint venture with aaa carolinas to market automobile insurance to club members  which was terminated on october  although the joint venture with aaa carolinas was terminated in  a portion of the gross written premiums related thereto were earned in gross written premiums are earned ratably over the respective policy terms  and therefore premiums earned in the current year are related to policies written during both the current and prior year 
in  american southern s five key states in terms of premium revenue  alabama  florida  georgia  indiana  and ohio  were relatively consistent with those in and accounted for approximately of total earned premiums for the performance of an insurance company is often measured by its combined ratio 
the combined ratio represents the percentage of losses  loss adjustment expenses and other expenses that are incurred for each dollar of premium earned by the company 
a combined ratio of under represents an underwriting profit while a combined ratio of over indicates an underwriting loss 
the combined ratio is divided into two components  the loss ratio the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and the expense ratio the ratio of expenses incurred to premiums earned 
the combined ratio for american southern increased to in from a combined ratio of in the loss ratio increased to in from in the overall increase in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to higher incurred losses in the surety line of business due to problems in the construction industry which did not occur in the expense ratio increased to in from in the increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to a relatively consistent level of fixed expenses coupled with a decrease in premium revenues 
the combined ratio for american southern decreased to in from in the single largest component of the decrease was the decreased loss ratio which decreased to in from in the decrease in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to the loss and cancellation of several commercial programs 
the expense ratio increased to in from in due primarily to slightly higher profit margins on the business with variable commissions 
in establishing reserves  american southern initially reserves for losses at the upper end of the reasonable range if no other value within the range is determined to be more probable 
selection of such an initial loss pick is an attempt by management to give recognition that initial claims information received generally is not conclusive with respect to legal liability  is generally not comprehensive with respect to magnitude of loss and generally  based on historical experience  will develop more adversely as time and information evolves 
however  as a result  american southern generally experiences reserve redundancies when analyzing the development of prior year losses in a current period 
at december   the range of estimates developed in connection with the loss reserves for american southern indicated that reserves could be as much as lower or as much as higher 
development from prior years reserves has historically reduced the current 
table of contents year loss ratio  however  such reduction in the current year loss ratio is generally offset by the reserves established in the current year for current period losses 
american southern s reserve redundancies for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
to the extent reserve redundancies vary between years  there is an incremental impact on the results of operations from american southern and the company 
the indicated redundancy in was million less than that in after considering the impact on contingent commissions and other related accruals  the million decline in the redundancy resulted in a decline in income from operations before tax of approximately million in as compared to conversely  the indicated redundancy in was million greater than that in  and after considering the impact of contingent commissions and other related accruals  the million increase in the indicated redundancy resulted in an increase in income from operations before tax of approximately million in as compared to management believes that such differences will continue in future periods but is unable to determine if or when incremental redundancies will increase or decrease  until the underlying losses are ultimately settled 
contingent commissions  if contractually applicable  are ultimately payable to agents based on the underlying profitability of a particular insurance contract or a group of insurance contracts  and are periodically evaluated and accrued as earned 
approximately of american southern s business provides for contractual commission arrangements which compensate the company s agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write 
by structuring its business in this manner  american southern provides its agents with an economic incentive to place profitable business with american southern 
in periods when loss reserves reflect favorable development from prior years reserves  there is generally a highly correlated increase in commission expense also related to the prior year business 
accordingly  favorable loss development from prior years  while anticipated to continue in future periods  is not an indicator of significant additional profitability in the current year 
bankers fidelity the following summarizes  for the periods indicated  bankers fidelity s premiums  losses and expenses year ended december  in thousands medicare supplement other health products life insurance total earned premiums insurance benefits and losses underwriting expenses total expenses underwriting loss premium revenue at bankers fidelity decreased million  or  during as compared to premiums from the medicare supplement line of business decreased million  or  in from and accounted for of total earned premiums 
in  the company s five key states in terms of premium revenue  georgia  indiana  ohio  pennsylvania  and utah  were consistent with those in and accounted for approximately of total earned premiums for the general decline in medicare supplement premiums has resulted primarily from the increase in competition not only from traditional insurance company competitors but also the federal government as it provides incentives directly and indirectly to seniors to exit traditional medicare programs and choose instead medicare advantage and other similar plans which result in much different economics to the insured 
premiums from the life insurance line of business decreased million  or  during compared to due to the redemption and settlement of existing policies exceeding the level of new sales activity 
the other health products premiums decreased to million in from million in  or  primarily as a result of decreased 
table of contents business activities with group associations 
premiums from group associations decreased million  or  during as compared to due to a decline in first year premiums and the non renewal of existing policies 
premium revenue at bankers fidelity decreased million  or  during as compared to the most significant decrease in premiums was in the medicare supplement line of business  where premiums decreased million  or  due to the continued decline in new business levels and non renewal of certain policies that resulted from increased competition  as discussed previously 
in  the company s key five states collectively accounted for approximately of total earned premiums 
the medicare supplement line of business in these states decreased approximately million as compared to premiums from the life insurance line of business decreased million  or  during due to a continued decline in sales related activities 
the other health products premiums increased to million in from million in  or  primarily as a result of increased business activities with group associations 
in  bankers fidelity began targeting group associations for additional sources of new business 
benefits and losses decreased slightly during as compared to and million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of earned premiums  benefits and losses were in compared to in and in the increasing loss ratio between years was primarily due to the continued aging of the life business 
in the years ended december   and  favorable loss development  primarily from adjustments to the prior years ibnr reserves  was million  million and million  respectively 
bankers fidelity s medicare supplement premium revenue peaked in and has continued to decline through with the introduction of medicare advantage and other competitive products  discussed previously  medicare supplement revenues declined in the year ended december  as compared to for the years ended december  and  medicare supplement premiums declined and  respectively  from the comparable prior years 
such premium revenue declines disrupted historical patterns on which determinations of ibnr reserve adequacy had been based 
a primary consideration in reserve adequacy during this period was the significant potential for adverse selection 
even though premium revenues declined  because of offsetting rate increases  the decline in policy count was greater than indicated 
accordingly  until historical experience could be further developed in a declining business environment  indicated excess reserves as a result of favorable development were recognized at the low end of the reasonable range of indicated redundancy 
premium declines on a monthly basis have since moderated and management does not believe that redundancies of such magnitude will continue in future years as evidenced in the development 
underwriting expenses decreased million  or  during as compared to  and decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in underwriting expenses during was primarily due to decreases in advertising and agency related expenses 
the decrease in underwriting expenses during was directly related to the decline in premium revenues 
as a percentage of earned premiums  these expenses were in compared to in and in the increase in the expense ratio during was primarily due to increased costs on marketing initiatives related to product diversification initiatives 
the indicated underwriting loss of million in and and million in is prior to considering investment income which is a significant component in evaluating profitability  particularly in the life insurance business 
increased marketing efforts have resulted in underwriting expenses declining at a slower rate than the related premiums and thus increasing the indicated underwriting loss 
investment income and realized gains investment income of million increased slightly in as compared to the increase in investment income during was primarily attributable to an increased level of invested assets which resulted from the company investing the proceeds received from the sale of its regional property and casualty operations 
partially offsetting the increase in investment income was a large number of called securities  the proceeds of which the company was not able to reinvest at equivalent market rates 

table of contents investment income of million decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in investment income during was primarily due to a large number of called securities in the second half of the year  the proceeds of which were reinvested at lower rates 
the company had net realized investment losses of million in and net realized investment gains of million in and million in the net realized investment losses in were due to impairment charges related to the write down in the value of certain bonds  preferred and common stocks 
the significant net realized investment gains in were primarily the result of the disposition of the investment in equity securities of wachovia corporation which resulted in a realized investment gain of million 
the net realized investment gains in were primarily due to the sale of a portion of the company s automotive sector investments bonds of general motors  gmac and ford  a portion of the company s investment in equity securities of wachovia corporation  and the sale of a real estate partnership interest  all of which resulted in realized investment gains totaling million 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded investment impairments due to other than temporary declines in values  which reduced reported realized investment gains  related to the following investments in thousands corporate securities redeemable preferred stocks common and non redeemable preferred stocks other invested assets while the impairments did not impact the carrying value of the investments  they resulted in realized losses of million in and million in management continually evaluates the company s investment portfolio and  as needed  makes adjustments for impairments and or will divest investments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense of million decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in interest expense during was primarily due to a decrease in the london interbank offered rate libor  which occurred in the latter half of and into the company s interest expense related to its borrowings  including the trust preferred obligations and its outstanding bank debt  is based on libor 
in addition  the company repaid the outstanding balance of million under the company s credit agreement the credit agreement with wachovia bank  national association wachovia  which decreased interest expense by reducing the company s average outstanding debt level during interest expense of million decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in interest expense during was due to active management of the revolving nature of amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
during each quarter  using excess funds  the company repaid a substantial portion of its bank borrowings 
at each quarter end  the company would then reborrow funds under the credit agreement such that borrowed amounts were consistent at each quarter end 
such periodic bank borrowings and repayments resulted in a reduction in interest expense by reducing the average debt level outstanding during as compared to other expenses other expenses commissions  underwriting expenses  and other expenses decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease in other expenses during was primarily attributable to targeted reductions in compensation  which were effective beginning october   the elimination of certain corporate positions  and other cost reduction initiatives which were implemented in the fourth quarter of partially offsetting the decrease in other expenses were million in discretionary bonus payments to certain officers of the company in connection with the completion of the sale of the regional property and casualty operations  million in incremental additional compensation accruals for recognition of management performance and a million goodwill impairment charge  all of which were expensed in 
table of contents as a percentage of earned premiums  other expenses were in as compared with in the increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to the bonus compensation accruals and the goodwill impairment charge discussed previously coupled with a decrease in premium revenues 
other expenses decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease in premium revenue that occurred in resulted in a corresponding decrease in the related commissions and underwriting expenses 
as a percentage of earned premiums  other expenses were in as compared with in the increase in other expenses as a percentage of earned premiums resulted from the increased marketing costs incurred in connection with continuing to diversify and grow the book of business 
offsetting some of the increased marketing costs were cost reduction initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of income taxes the primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory income tax rate result from the dividends received deduction drd  the small life insurance company deduction sld and the change in asset valuation allowance 
the current year drd is adjusted as underlying factors change  including known actual distributions earned on invested assets 
the actual current drd can vary from the estimates based on  but not limited to  amounts of distributions from these investments as well as appropriate levels of taxable income 
the sld varies in amount and is determined at a rate of percent of the tentative life insurance company taxable income licti 
the amount of the sld for any taxable year is reduced but not below zero by percent of the tentative licti for such taxable year as it exceeds million and is ultimately phased out at million 
the change in the asset valuation allowance primarily results from a periodic assessment of the realization of certain loss carry forward benefits 
liquidity and capital resources the primary cash needs of the company are for the payment of claims and operating expenses  maintaining adequate statutory capital and surplus levels  and meeting debt service requirements 
current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but generally are expected to continue within historical ranges 
the company s primary sources of cash are written premiums  investment income and the sale and maturity of its invested assets 
the company believes that  within each business unit  total invested assets will be sufficient to satisfy all policy liabilities and that cash inflows from investment earnings  future premium receipts and reinsurance collections will be adequate to fund the payment of claims and expenses as needed 
cash flows at the parent are derived from dividends  management fees  and tax sharing payments from the subsidiaries 
the cash needs of the parent are for the payment of operating expenses  the acquisition of capital assets and debt service requirements 
at december   the parent had approximately million of cash and short term investments 
net cash used in operating activities by the parent was less than million in both and  accordingly  the company believes that given traditional funding sources of the parent combined with current cash and short term investments  the current liquidity issues being faced by certain other companies as a result of the current economic conditions and funding constraints should not be an issue for the company and or the parent for the foreseeable future 
dividend payments to the parent by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to annual limitations and are restricted to the greater of of statutory surplus or statutory earnings before recognizing realized investment gains of the individual insurance subsidiaries 
at december   the parent s insurance subsidiaries had statutory surplus of million 
the parent provides certain administrative  purchasing and other services to each of its subsidiaries 
the amounts charged to and paid by the subsidiaries were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in addition  the parent has a formal tax sharing agreement with each of its insurance subsidiaries 
a net total of million  million and million was paid to the parent under the tax sharing agreements in   and  respectively 
dividends were paid to atlantic american by its subsidiaries totaling million in  million in  and million in as a result of 
table of contents the parent s tax loss carryforwards  which totaled approximately million at december   it is anticipated that the tax sharing agreements will continue to provide the parent with additional funds sufficient to meet its cash flow obligations 
in addition to these internal funding sources  the company maintains its revolving credit facility under the credit agreement pursuant to which the company was able to  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  initially borrow or reborrow up to million the commitment amount 
in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement  the commitment amount is incrementally reduced every six months and was equal to million at december  the interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement is  at the option of the company  equivalent to either a the base rate which equals the higher of the prime rate or above the federal funds rate  each as defined or b the libor determined on an interest period of month  months  months or months  plus an applicable margin as defined 
the applicable margin varies based upon the company s leverage ratio funded debt to total capitalization  each as defined and ranges from to 
interest on amounts outstanding is payable quarterly 
the credit agreement requires the company to comply with certain covenants  including  among others  ratios that relate funded debt to both total capitalization and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as well as the maintenance of minimum levels of tangible net worth 
the company must also comply with limitations on capital expenditures  certain payments  additional debt obligations  equity repurchases and certain redemptions  as well as minimum risk based capital levels 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  wachovia may terminate the credit agreement and declare all amounts outstanding due and payable in full 
during the first half of  the company repaid the outstanding balance of million to wachovia and since then has not reborrowed any amounts under this credit agreement 
effective october   the credit agreement was amended to allow the company to redeem all the outstanding shares of the company s series b preferred stock  par value per share series b preferred stock for million  and to allow the company to pay a dividend in connection therewith  as described below 
this transaction was completed on october  the company has two statutory trusts which exist for the exclusive purpose of issuing trust preferred securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trusts and investing the gross proceeds of the trust preferred securities in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures junior subordinated debentures 
the outstanding million of junior subordinated debentures have a maturity of thirty years from their original date of issuance  are callable  in whole or in part  only at the option of the company five years after their respective dates of issue and quarterly thereafter  and have an interest rate of three month libor plus an applicable margin 
the margin ranges from to 
at december   the effective interest rate was 
the obligations of the company with respect to the issuances of the trust preferred securities represent a full and unconditional guarantee by the parent of each trust s obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities 
subject to certain exceptions and limitations  the company may elect from time to time to defer junior subordinated debenture interest payments  which would result in a deferral of distribution payments on the related trust preferred securities 
the company intends to pay its obligations under the credit agreement  if any  and the junior subordinated debentures using dividend and tax sharing payments from the operating subsidiaries  or from potential future financing arrangements 
in addition  the company believes that  if necessary  at maturity  the credit agreement could be refinanced  although there can be no assurance of the terms or conditions of such a refinancing  or its availability 
during  the company entered into a zero cost rate collar with wachovia to hedge future interest payments on a portion of the junior subordinated debentures 
the notional amount of the collar was million with an effective date of march  the collar has a libor floor rate of and a libor cap rate of and adjusts quarterly on the th of each march  june  september and december through termination on march  the company began making payments to wachovia under the zero cost rate collar on june  while the company is exposed to counterparty risk should wachovia fail to perform  the recent decrease in interest rates  coupled with the current macroeconomic outlook would indicate 
table of contents that the company s current exposure is minimal 
the estimated fair value and related carrying value of the company s rate collar at december  was a liability of approximately million 
at december   the company had  shares of series b preferred stock outstanding  having a stated value of per share 
all of the shares of series b preferred stock were held by mr robinson  the company s chairman emeritus  and his affiliates the holders 
annual dividends on the series b preferred stock were per share and were cumulative 
dividends accrued whether or not declared by the company s board of directors 
as of december   the company had accrued but unpaid dividends on the series b preferred stock of million 
on october   the company redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of series b preferred stock at the stated value of per share  for an aggregate payment of million 
in connection therewith  the company also paid million in dividends to the holders of the series b preferred stock in satisfaction of a portion of the accrued but unpaid dividends on the series b preferred stock through the date of redemption 
the holders of the series b preferred stock agreed to discharge the company from any obligation to pay the remaining million of accrued but unpaid dividends on the series b preferred stock and to release the company from any further obligations thereunder

 consolidated financial statements arb 
noncontrolling interest refers to the minority interest portion of the equity of a subsidiary that is not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards that require for profit entities that prepare consolidated financial statements to a present noncontrolling interests as a component of equity  separate from the parent s equity  b separately present the amount of consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the income statement  c consistently account for changes in a parent s ownership interests in a subsidiary in which the parent entity has a controlling financial interest as equity transactions  d require an entity to measure at fair value its remaining interest in a subsidiary that is deconsolidated  and e require an entity to provide sufficient disclosures that identify and clearly distinguish between interests of the parent and interests of noncontrolling owners

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement 
table of contents permits entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible items at fair value ie the fair value option 
items eligible for the fair value option include certain recognized financial assets and liabilities  rights and obligations under certain insurance contracts that are not financial instruments  host financial instruments resulting from the separation of an embedded nonfinancial derivative instrument from a nonfinancial hybrid instrument  and certain commitments 
business entities are required to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in net income 
the fair value option a may be applied instrument by instrument  with certain exceptions  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas was effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november   although early adoption was permitted under certain conditions 
the company adopted sfas on january  and did not elect the fair value option for any eligible items 
adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange price at which an asset could be sold or a liability settled in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
sfas provides guidance on measuring fair value when required under existing accounting standards and establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques 
the first level of such hierarchy determines fair value at the quoted price unadjusted in active markets for identical assets level 
the second level determines fair value using valuation methodology including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly for substantially similar terms level 
the third level for determining fair value utilizes inputs to valuation methodology which are unobservable for the asset or liability level 
such values inherently involve a greater degree of judgment and uncertainty and therefore ultimately greater price volatility 
a financial asset s or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company adopted sfas on january  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the fair values for fixed maturity and equity securities are largely determined by either independent methods prescribed by the naic  which do not differ materially from nationally quoted market prices  when available  or independent broker quotations 
the company s level instruments consist of short term investments 
the company s level instruments include most of its fixed maturity securities  which consist of us treasury securities and us government securities  municipal bonds  and certain corporate fixed maturity securities as well as its common and non redeemable preferred stocks 
the company s level instruments include certain fixed maturity securities and a zero cost rate collar 
fair value is based on criteria that use assumptions or other data that are not readily observable from objective sources 
as of december   the company s fixed maturity securities valued using level criteria totaled million and the zero cost rate collar was a liability of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents assets measured at fair value  as of december   on a recurring basis are summarized below quoted prices in active significant markets other significant for identical observable unobservable assets inputs inputs level level level total in thousands fixed maturity securities equity securities short term investments total impact of inflation insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect such losses and expenses  are known 
consequently  the company attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
if  for competitive reasons  premiums cannot be increased to anticipate inflation  this cost would be absorbed by the company 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on the company s investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on investment income 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company has structured borrowings that  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  are recorded on the company s balance sheet at an amount that differs from the ultimate contractual obligation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table discloses the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands junior subordinated debentures interest payable operating leases purchase commitments losses and claims future policy benefits unearned premiums other policy liabilities total interest payable is based on interest rates as of december  and assumes that all debt remains outstanding until its stated contractual maturity 
the interest on junior subordinated debentures is at various rates of interest 
represents balances due for goods and or services which have been contractually committed as of december  to the extent contracts provide for early termination with notice but without penalty  only the amounts contractually due during the notice period have been included 

table of contents losses and claims include case reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims ibnr 
while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company  the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr reserves is an estimate  subject to significant uncertainty 
the actual amount to be paid is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with any applicable claimant 
final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates  particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future 
in estimating the timing of future payments by year  the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue 
however  the actual timing of future payments will likely vary materially from these estimates due to  among other things  changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements 
amounts reflected do not include reinsurance amounts which may also be recoverable based on the level of ultimate sustained loss 
future policy benefits relate to life insurance policies on which the company is not currently making payments and will not make future payments unless and until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as a death or disability  or the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy 
occurrence of any of these events is outside the control of the company and the payment estimates are based on significant uncertainties such as mortality  morbidity  expenses  persistency  investment returns  inflation and the timing of payments 
for regulatory purposes  the company does perform cash flow modeling of such liabilities  which is the basis for the indicated disclosure  however  due to the significance of the assumptions used  the amount presented could materially differ from actual results 
unearned premiums represent potential future revenue for the company  however  under certain circumstances  such premiums may be refundable with cancellation of the underlying policy 
significantly all unearned premiums will be earned within the following twelve month period as the related future insurance protection is provided 
significantly all costs related to such unearned premiums have already been incurred and paid and are included in deferred acquisition costs  however  future losses related to the unearned premiums have not been recorded 
the contractual obligations related to unearned premiums reflected in the table represent the average loss ratio applied to the year end unearned premium balances  with loss payments projected in comparable proportions to the year end loss and claims reserves 
projecting future losses is subject to significant uncertainties and the projected payments will most likely vary materially from these estimates as a result of differences in future severity  frequency and other anticipated and unanticipated factors 
amounts reflected do not take into account reinsurance amounts which may be recoverable based on the level of ultimate sustained loss

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk due to the nature of the company s business  it is exposed to both interest rate and market risk 
changes in interest rates  which represent a significant risk factor affecting the company  may result in changes in the fair value of the company s investments  cash flows and interest income and expense 
to manage this risk  the company generally invests in us government agency fixed maturity securities and monitors its level of investment in securities that are directly linked to loans or mortgages
