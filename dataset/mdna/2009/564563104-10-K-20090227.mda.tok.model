for more information on our discontinued operations  please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a provider of innovative technologies and solutions for mission critical national security programs for the intelligence community  the departments of defense  state  homeland security and justice  the space community  and other us federal government customers 
our expertise includes engineering  systems integration  software services  enterprise architecture  information assurance and security architecture  intelligence operations and analysis support  network and critical infrastructure protection  information operations and computer forensics  information technology  communications integration and engineering support 
with approximately  highly qualified employees  we operate in the united states and approximately countries worldwide 
we derive revenue primarily from contracts with us government agencies that are focused on national security and as a result  funding for our programs is generally linked to trends in us government spending in the areas of defense  intelligence and homeland security 
related to the evolving terrorist threats and world events  the us government has substantially increased its overall defense  intelligence and homeland security budgets 
our revenue increased mainly as a result of the expansion of our sustainment and countermine support provided in military deployed environments with us and allied forces in support of peace keeping efforts worldwide  efforts involving telecommunications  infrastructure  maintenance and repair  from our work with intelligence agencies in u 
s  and the acquisitions that occurred in the past three years 
for the three years ended december   over of our revenues were derived from our customers in the intelligence community and the department of defense 
these customers include the office of the secretary of defense  the department of state  the department of homeland security  various intelligence agencies  federal intelligence and terrorism task forces  the us army  navy  air force and marine corps  and joint military commands 
we also provide solutions to federal government civilian agencies  including nasa and pto  as well as to state and local governments and commercial customers 
the following table shows our revenue from each type of customer as a percentage of our total revenue for the period shown 
years ended december  department of defense and intelligence agencies federal civilian agencies state agencies  international agencies and commercial entities total revenue 
table of contents we provide our services and solutions under three types of contracts time and materials  cost reimbursable  and fixed price 
our contract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors  including our business strategies and federal government procurement objectives 
the following table shows our revenue from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods shown 
years ended december  cost reimbursable time and materials fixed price total revenue time and materials contracts 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
to the extent that our actual labor costs under a time and materials contract are higher or lower than the billing rates under the contract  our profit under the contract may be either greater or less than we anticipated or we may suffer a loss under the contract 
we recognize revenues under time and materials contracts by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended by the contract billing rates and adding the effect of other billable direct costs 
in general  we realize a higher profit margin on work performed under time and materials contracts than cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract and paid a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
under cost reimbursable contracts we recognize revenues and an estimate of applicable fees earned as costs are incurred 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of sec topic  revenue recognition  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts 
fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings 
we generally do not undertake complex  high risk work  such as long term software development  under fixed price terms 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period 
revenue on fixed price contracts that provide for the company to render services throughout a period is recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided on a proportionate performance basis 
these contracts are generally less than six months in duration 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the delivery of a specific product with related customer acceptance provisions  revenues are recognized as those products are delivered and accepted 
we derive a majority of our revenues from contracts directly with the us government or as a subcontractor to other providers of services to the us government 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods years ended december  prime contract revenue subcontract revenue total revenue 
table of contents our prime contract revenue as a percentage of our total revenue decreased from to as customers increased the purchase of goods and services through larger  more consolidated contract vehicles 
however  we expect the prime contract revenue percentage to increase in future periods due to the award of the countermine prime contract for route clearance in august revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from services and solutions provided to the federal government or to prime contractors supporting the federal government  including services provided by our employees  our subcontractors and through solutions that includes third party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate as a part of our overall solutions 
the level of hardware and software purchases we made in support of solutions we provide to our clients increased significantly during these requirements may vary from period to period depending on specific contract and client requirements 
since we earn higher profits from labor services that our employees provide compared with subcontracted efforts and other reimbursable items such as hardware and software purchases for clients  we seek to optimize our labor services on all of our engagements 
cost of services cost of services primarily includes direct costs incurred to provide our services and solutions to customers 
the most significant portion of these costs are direct labor costs  including salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits of our employees directly serving customers  in addition to the related management  facilities and infrastructure costs 
cost of services also includes other direct costs  such as the costs of subcontractors and outside consultants and third party materials  including hardware or software that we purchase and provide to the customer as part of an integrated solution 
since we earn higher profits on our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenue to decline when our labor services mix increases relative to subcontracted labor or third party material 
conversely  as subcontracted labor or third party material purchases for customers increase relative to our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenue to increase 
changes in the mix of services and equipment provided under our contracts can result in variability in our contract margins 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits of our employees not performing work directly for clients 
among the functions covered by these costs are facilities  corporate business development  bid and proposal  contracts administration  finance and accounting  legal  corporate governance and executive and senior management 
in addition  we include stock based compensation  as computed under sfas r  as well as depreciation expense of million and amortization expense of million related to the general and administrative function for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of computers  furniture and other equipment  the amortization of third party software we use internally  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships and contract backlogs acquired in business combinations are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
interest expense interest expense is primarily related to interest expense incurred or accrued under our outstanding borrowings and notes payable  deferred financing charges and interest on capital leases 
interest income interest income is primarily from cash on hand and notes receivable 

table of contents provision for income taxes our effective income tax rates are approximately  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
the higher tax rate in as compared to related primarily to the impact of non deductible losses related to our employee supplemental savings plan  which were partially offset by research and development credits 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated statements of income the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income and the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenue as well as the year over year change from december  to december  years ended december  year to year change to dollars percentages dollars percent dollars in thousands revenue cost of services general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income other income expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes gain on sale of discontinued operation  net of taxes sold to ceo net income revenues revenues increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase was primarily due to our contracts supporting forward deployments in iraq  afghanistan and other areas around the world and our acquisitions of srs in may  mbi in december  etg in august and ewa in november revenue growth of million came from global logistics and supply chain management contracts  specifically contracts for the installation and repair of systems designed to counter or clear mines and ieds 
for the year ending december   our recent acquisitions  srs  mbi  etg and ewa  contributed revenue increases of million 
we are expecting the growth in revenue to continue in as a result of our recent acquisitions and our continued support of the global war on terror  including increased demand in support of operations within the 
table of contents southwest asian region  including iraq and afghanistan 
we are well positioned to compete for and receive contracts related to the comprehensive national cyber initiative 
possible future changes in us policy and tactics related to the wars may impact our future performance trend 
cost of services cost of services increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase in cost of services is primarily due to larger purchases of equipment  materials and other direct costs directly related to our contracts and our recent acquisitions of srs  mbi  etg and ewa

as a percentage of revenues  direct labor costs decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the decrease in direct labor as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to an increase in other direct costs in relation to revenues 
other direct costs  which include subcontractors and third party equipment and materials used in the performance of our contracts  increased by over the same period in the increase in other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in purchases of equipment and materials on our contracts for installation and repair of systems designed to counter or clear mines and ieds  as noted above  as well as our recent acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenues  other direct costs increased from for the year ended december  to for the same period in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in expense resulted primarily from the recent acquisitions of srs  mbi  etg and ewa and increased spending to support the growth of our business 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to from for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction as a percentage of revenues was largely due to the leveraging of our administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease in interest expense is due to a decline in interest rates  partially offset by an increase in our average outstanding debt balance 
our average outstanding debt balance for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the interest rate we incur on our credit facility is impacted by changes in the federal funds rate or london interbank offer rate libor 
changes in these lending rates could lead to fluctuations in our interest expense in future periods

grs  acquired during the fourth quarter of  contributed million to our revenues for the year ended december  the mbi acquisition on december  had an insignificant impact to our revenue 
cost of services cost of services increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase is related to the increase in revenues for the period 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of services increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in this increase was due to larger purchases of equipment and materials directly for contracts and increased use of subcontractors in support of our contracts 
the increase in other direct costs resulted in lower income from continuing operations primarily due to generally lower profit margins on purchases of equipment and materials 
direct labor costs  which include applicable fringe benefits and overhead  increased by due to the acquisition of srs and the growth of our work force 
as a percentage of revenues  direct labor costs decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in due to the significant growth in other direct cost 
other direct costs increased by over the same period in  from million to million

as a percentage of revenues  other direct costs increased from for the year ended december  to for the same period in general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in expense during the year resulted primarily from the acquisition and integration of srs  increased bid and proposal spending  a net realizable value adjustment related to an intangible asset of a previous acquisition and share based compensation 
in addition  amortization of intangibles increased due to our acquisition of srs in may as well as our acquisition of grs in october as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction as a percentage of revenues was due largely to a management cost cutting initiative in and leveraging our administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in share based compensation expense under sfas r  respectively 
gain on disposal of operations there were no gains on disposal of operations in in october   we sold assets related to our netwitness business to the netwitness acquisition corporation  an unrelated third party

table of contents driven by increased borrowings to fund the acquisitions of srs and mbi 
in  we had paid off all borrowings under a previous credit facility  which had been used to finance the acquisition of gray hawk systems in interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the fluctuation is due to increased cash on hand for almost half of the year ended december   collection of interest on an old receivable and an income tax refund 
as we used a combination of cash on hand and our new credit facility to finance the acquisition of srs in may and mbi in december  our cash balance was reduced significantly during the second half of loss from discontinued operations on february   we sold our msm subsidiary 
prior to that date  msm was classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets and discontinued operations  net of applicable income taxes in our consolidated statements of income 
loss from discontinued operations decreased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in the sale of msm resulted in the reflection of only two months of msm operations in versus a full year of msm operations for the same period in for additional information see discontinued operations  below

net income net income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase is a result of higher revenue  increased income from continuing operations and a reduced net loss on discontinued operations of million in versus a loss of million for the same period in our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
backlog for the years ended  and our backlog was billion  billion and billion  respectively  of which billion  million and million  respectively  was funded backlog 
backlog represents estimates that we calculate on a consistent basis 
at december   etg and ewa contributed approximately million in backlog combined 
we estimate that approximately to of our total backlog will be recognized as revenues prior to december  effects of inflation inflation and uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment  such as conditions in the financial markets could impact our labor rates beyond the predetermined escalation factors 
however  we generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner to accommodate the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
under our time and materials contracts  labor rates are usually adjusted annually by predetermined escalation factors 
our cost reimbursable contracts automatically adjust for changes in cost 
under our fixed price contracts  we include a predetermined escalation factor  but generally  we have not been adversely affected by near term inflation 
purchases of equipments and materials directly for contracts are usually cost reimbursable 
in addition  inflation or inflationary concerns could prompt the federal reserve to begin increasing the federal funds rate 
as one of the borrowing rates in our credit facility is tied to the federal funds rate  
table of contents increases in this rate  given similar levels of debt  could lead to higher interest expense 
however  the federal reserve recently cut this rate because the pace of us economic activity has slowed and inflation is expected to moderate as a result of lower energy and commodities prices 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are the financing of acquisitions  working capital and capital expenditures 
our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and our revolving credit facility 
on april   we executed a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by bank of america na  as administrative agent 
the credit agreement initially provides for up to million in available borrowings 
see credit agreement below for additional information 
at december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility and we were contingently liable under letters of credit totaling million  which reduces our ability to borrow under our credit facility 
the maximum available borrowing under our credit facility at december  was million 
generally  cash provided by operating activities is adequate to fund our operations 
due to fluctuations in our cash flows and the growth in our operations  it is necessary from time to time to increase borrowings under our credit facility to meet cash demands 
in the future  we may borrow greater amounts in order to finance acquisitions or new contract start ups 
the interest rates we pay under our credit facility are based on market rates that are at historic lows 
we anticipate that this rate will increase in the future  however we cannot predict the timing of such increase 
the us and worldwide capital and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions 
continued uncertainty in the capital and credit markets may negatively impact our business  including our ability to access financing at reasonable terms  which may negatively affect our ability to make future acquisitions 
a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing 
cash flows from operating activities year ended december  in thousands net cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations net cash flow from discontinued operations net cash flow from operating activities our operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner and our ability to manage our vendor payments

for more information see discontinued operations  below 
cash flow from investing activities could fluctuate significantly in the future with the execution of our acquisition strategy 
cash flows from financing activities year ended december  in thousands net cash flow from financing activities cash used in financing activities during resulted primarily from paying down our credit facility with cash from operations  this was slightly offset by borrowings under our credit facility to finance our acquisitions of ewa and etg  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we intend to pay down the remaining balance on our credit facility during fiscal year in addition  we acquired treasury stock with a cost of million related to the distribution of a supplemental executive retirement plan gjp serp for our chairman and ceo for additional information see note in our consolidated financial statements 
the cash outflow for the acquisition of treasury stock was offset by the excess tax benefits generated by stock option exercises and the gjp serp transaction 
cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the use of our credit facility to support the acquisitions of srs and mbi and proceeds from the exercise of stock options

critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  including the critical policies listed below  are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition and cost estimation we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we have a standard internal process that we use to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

table of contents our revenues consist primarily of services provided by our employees and the pass through of costs for materials and subcontract efforts under contracts with our customers 
cost of services consists primarily of compensation expenses for program personnel  the fringe benefits associated with this compensation and other direct expenses incurred to complete programs  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
we derive the majority of our revenue from cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  firm fixed price or time and materials contracts 
revenues for cost reimbursable contracts are recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred  including an estimated share of the applicable contractual fees earned 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  that are subject to the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contract  or sop  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of sec topic  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
for time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for long term fixed price production contracts  revenue is recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered or by other methods to measure services provided 
revenue from other long term fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate methods to measure services provided 
contract costs are expensed as incurred except for certain limited long term contracts noted below 
for long term contracts  specifically described in the scope section of sop or other appropriate accounting literature  we apply the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized at a consistent profit margin over the period of performance based on estimated profit margins at completion of the contract 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract cost at completion of the contract 
during the performance of long term contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
the impact on revenue and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses for such contracts 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 
in certain circumstances  revenues are recognized when contract amendments have not been finalized 
accounting for business combinations and goodwill the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets  financial assets and separately recognized intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
we review goodwill at least annually for impairment 
we have elected to perform this review annually during the second quarter of each calendar year and no adjustments were necessary for our continuing operations 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit s fair value and the relative size of the company s recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations 
the new standard moves closer to a fair value model by requiring the acquirer to measure all assets acquired and all liabilities assumed at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition  including the measurement of noncontrolling interests at fair 
table of contents value 
sfas r also establishes principles and requirements as to how the acquirer recognizes and measures goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
in addition  sfas r significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas  including the treatment of contingent consideration  preacquisition contingencies  in process research and development  restructuring costs and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
the effective date of sfas r is for fiscal years beginning after december  for transactions consummated after the effective date of sfas r  prospective application of the new standard is applied 
for business combinations consummated prior to the effective date of sfas r  the guidance in sfas  business combinations  is applied 
the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and provides accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  commonly referred to as minority interest  and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the new standard requires noncontrolling interests to be presented separately within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position 
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interests will be clearly identified and presented on the face of the statement of operations 
when a change in control of a subsidiary occurs it will either be accounted for as an equity transaction when control is maintained or a gain or loss will be recognized when control is not maintained 
the remaining noncontrolling interest will be remeasured to fair value when control is lost 
sfas requires that the noncontrolling interest continue to be attributed its share of losses and thus is no longer limited to the original carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest 
this may result in a negative carrying balance 
the effective date of sfas is for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas will be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year in which sfas is adopted except for presentation and disclosure requirements  which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on april   the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  or fsp fsp addresses determining the useful life of an intangible asset when the intangible asset has renewal or extension options 
fsp amends sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which explains the useful life assessment criteria in regards to developing assumptions about renewal or extension options to allow entities to consider its own historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements adjusted for entity specific factors 
sfas requires entities to determine whether the renewal or extension can be accomplished without substantial cost or material modifications of the existing terms and conditions in connection with the asset 
fsp removes the criteria to consider whether an intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modification 
the guidance in fsp applies prospectively to intangible assets acquired after december   the effective date of fsp the new disclosure requirements of fsp apply to all intangible assets recognized as of and subsequent to december  we do not believe the adoption of fsp will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  which establishes the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the current gaap hierarchy is set forth in aicpa statement on auditing standards no 
 the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
in issuing sfas  the gaap hierarchy now resides in accounting literature established by the fasb versus the aicpa 
the adoption of sfas will not impact our current practice of preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued fsp fas and fin r  disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities  which amends sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  to require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets 
it also amends fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  to require public enterprises to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with variable interest entities 
fsp fas and fin r requires certain disclosures to be provided by a public enterprise that is a a sponsor of a qualifying special purpose entity spe that holds a variable interest in the qualifying spe but was not the transferor nontransferor of financial assets to the qualifying spe and b a servicer of a qualifying spe that holds a significant variable interest in the qualifying spe but was not the transferor nontransferor of financial assets to the qualifying spe 
fsp fas and fin r is effective for the first reporting period ending after december  and will apply to each annual and interim reporting period thereafter 
the adoption of fsp fas and fin r is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
fsp eitf addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method of sfas  earnings per share 
fsp eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
all prior period earnings per share data presented will be adjusted retrospectively including interim financial statements  summaries of earnings and selected financial data to conform to the provisions of fsp eitf early application is not permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our financial statements 
in november  the sec issued for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board iasb 
under the proposed roadmap  we could be required in fiscal to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs 
the sec will make a determination in regarding the mandatory adoption of ifrs 
we are currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our consolidated financial statements and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of ifrs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense for the year ended december  by less than million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
when we have excess cash  we invest in short term  investment grade  interest bearing securities 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy 
under this policy  no investment securities can have maturities exceeding six months and the weighted average maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed days
