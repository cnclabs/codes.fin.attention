overview was another very challenging year for the housing industry  as the downturn in the housing market intensified 
home foreclosures and lack of financing for homebuyers resulted in continued high inventories of new and resale homes and sharp declines in new home deliveries 
the supply of resale and new homes far exceeds demand and even though annual single family new home production in the united states has dropped to million units per year  we do not anticipate that an equilibrium between the supply and demand for housing will be reached in this continuing imbalance  as well as the disruption in credit markets  has led to continued weak consumer confidence  a critical factor for home sales 
the challenging market conditions in negatively impacted our operations with lower home sales per community  price reductions and high home sale cancellation rates 
these factors resulted in an decrease in home closings to units when compared to home closings 
we entitle and develop land for our own communities and sell lots to third parties 
we also design  construct and market single and multi family homes primarily to move up and luxury homebuyers 
we operate in the following geographic regions  which are presented as our reportable segments northern california san francisco bay area and sacramento  southland los angeles  san diego riverside and the washington dc area 
our other operations that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate segment disclosure are included in corporate and other 
our goal is to maximize the total return on our common stockholders equity over the long term 
we plan to achieve this by actively managing our assets and creating value on the lots we own or control 
since going public in  we have limited the capital placed at risk  and have returned  through dividends and share buybacks  million to shareholders  or in excess of per share 
for the five year period to  cash provided from operations was million  which was used primarily to return cash to stockholders through the repurchase of shares and the payment of dividends and to repay debt 
despite the continuing challenges of the united states housing market  we believe our business is positioned to create further shareholder value over the long term through the selective control of a number of strategic projects and the overall level of lots controlled 
the  lots that we control   of which we own directly or through joint ventures  provide a strong foundation for our future homebuilding business and visibility on our future cash flow 
we believe we add value to the lots we control through entitlements  development and the construction of homes 
in allocating capital to our operations  we generally limit our risk on unentitled land by optioning such land positions in all our markets thereby mitigating our capital at risk 
option contracts for the purchase of land permit us to control lots for an extended period of time 
homebuilding is our primary source of revenue and has represented approximately of our total revenue since operating in markets with higher price points and catering to move up and luxury buyers  our average sales price in of  was well in excess of the national average sales price 
we also sell serviced and unserviced lots to other homebuilders  generally on an opportunistic basis where we can redeploy capital to an asset providing higher returns or reduce risk in a market 
in  we sold lots  the majority of which was a sale of finished lots in our san diego operations 
the number of lots we sell may vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and nature of such sales which are also affected by local market conditions 
our housing and land inventory  investments in housing and land joint ventures  and consolidated land inventory not owned together comprised of our total assets as of december  in addition  we had million in other assets 
other assets consist of homebuyer receivables of million  income taxes receivable of million  deferred taxes of million  and mortgages and other receivables of million 
homebuyer receivables consist primarily of proceeds due from homebuyers on the closing of homes

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements of our company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are those that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and require the most subjectivity and estimates by our management 
a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our company included elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents carrying values the housing and land inventory that we own directly and through joint ventures is reviewed for recoverability on a regular basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
to arrive at this amount  we estimate the cash flow for the life of each project 
these projections take into account the specific business plans for each project  and our estimate of the most probable set of economic conditions anticipated to prevail in the market area 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  they are then written down to the fair value less estimated selling costs 
the ultimate fair values for our housing and land inventory are dependent upon future market and economic conditions 
in addition  when assessing fair value  we also calculate a static residual value analysis which is assessed in conjunction with the discounted cash flow analysis to validate results from the fair value assessment 
if our estimate of future cash flows is significantly different from our actual cash flows  we may prematurely impair the value of the asset  we may underestimate the value of the calculated impairment or we may fail to record an impairment 
in these cases  our housing and land inventory would be represented on our balance sheet at other than its cost or fair value  which could have an effect on our gross margin in future periods as we develop and sell the assets 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of impairment charges related to housing and land we directly own which is included in our direct cost of sales 
the million in impairment charges were related to  lots located primarily in the inland empire of california and washington dc area 
in addition  we wrote off million  primarily related to unentitled lot option agreements on lots that expired or which we are no longer pursuing and we recognized million in impairment charges and write downs on investments related to lots in our joint ventures 
capitalized costs our housing and land inventory on our consolidated balance sheet includes the costs of acquiring land  development and construction costs  interest  property taxes and overhead directly related to the development of the land and housing 
direct costs are capitalized to individual homes and lots and other costs are allocated to each lot in proportion to our anticipated revenue 
estimates of costs to complete homes and lots sold are recorded at the time of closing 
these estimates are prepared on an individual home and lot basis and take into account the specific cost components of each individual home and lot 
the estimation process to allocate costs to homes and lots is dependent on project budgets that are based on various assumptions  including construction schedules and future costs to be incurred 
these estimates are reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing and adjustments are made if necessary 
if the estimates of costs are significantly different from our actual results  our housing and land inventory may be over or under stated on our balance sheet  and accordingly gross margins in a particular period may be over or under stated 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of homes are recognized when title passes to the purchaser upon closing  wherein all proceeds are received or collectability is evident 
land sales are recognized when title passes to the purchaser upon closing  all material conditions of the sales contract have been met and a significant cash down payment or appropriate security is received  and collectability is evident 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured by using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse 
sfas requires a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining our need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative 
we consider current and future expected losses or profits  the length of the statutory carry forward periods  our history with operating loss and tax credit carry forwards not expiring unused  and tax planning strategies 
during and  we incurred losses as a result of continued challenging market conditions 
at december  and  our deferred tax asset was million and million  respectively 
based on our evaluation  a valuation allowance is not required as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in the future 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
effective january   we adopted sfas sfas specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques that are based on observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level inputs are derived from quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets  level inputs are derived from quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable  and level inputs which are derived from instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas allows companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value 
companies electing the fair value option are required to report subsequent changes in fair value in earnings 
this statement was effective for the fiscal year beginning january  we did not elect the fair value option for any of our financial assets or financial liabilities under sfas and the standard has had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas clarifies the accounting for non controlling interests and establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary  including classification as a component of stockholders equity 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we are currently reviewing the impact  if any  that sfas may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations  which replaces the previous version of sfas sfas r provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired  liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interests in the acquiree as a result of business combinations 
the revised standard also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we are currently reviewing the impact  if any  that sfas r may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand how and why an entity uses derivative instruments and the instruments effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  with early application encouraged 
we are currently evaluating the impact that adopting sfas may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  which identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of non governmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap 
sfas is effective days following the security and exchange commission s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with gaap 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf  which addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share eps under the two class method in accordance with fas  earnings per share

seasonality and quarterly information we have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business and the timing of new community openings and the closing out of projects 
we typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first six months of the calendar year 
new home deliveries trail new home orders by several months  therefore we normally have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year 
as a result  our revenues from deliveries of homes are generally higher in the second half of the year 
the following table presents a summary of our operating results for each of the last eight quarters december september june march millions  except home closings and per share amounts total revenue gross margin loss net loss income diluted loss earnings per share home closings units total assets total debt quarterly and year to date computations of per share amounts are made independently 
therefore  the sum of per share amounts for the quarters may not agree with per share amounts for the year
