item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in item a  risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were founded in to develop  manufacture and sell high performance signal analysis tools to scientists engaged in high energy physics research 
in we introduced our first oscilloscope using our core competency of designing signal acquisition and digitizing technology 
we are a leading  worldwide provider of oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers as well as a provider of related test and measurement equipment and currently operate as one business segment in the test and measurement market 
our oscilloscopes are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in order to develop high performance systems  to validate electronic designs and to improve time to market 
we currently offer seven families of oscilloscopes  which address different solutions to the markets we serve waveexpert  a powerful family of sampling oscilloscopes and modules  wavemaster  one of our high performance product families  wavepro  which is targeted at the mid to high performance sector  waverunner  designed for the mid performance sector  wavesurfer  designed for users in the low bandwidth sector of the market  wavejet  designed for value oriented users in the low bandwidth sector of the market  and waveace  our entry level oscilloscope products 
our protocol analyzers are tools used by designers and engineers to generate and monitor traffic over high speed serial data interfaces  including usb  usb  bluetooth  pci express  serial ata  serial attached scsi sas  wireless usb  and others 
we sell our products into a broad range of end markets  including computer semiconductor consumer electronics  data storage  automotive industrial  and military aerospace markets 
we believe that our products offer a strong value proposition in these markets by providing advanced analysis capabilities coupled with innovative and proprietary technology features 
we believe designers in all of these markets are developing products which rely on increasingly complex electronic signals to provide the features and performance their customers require 
we employ a direct sales model utilizing a highly skilled global sales force where it makes economic sense to do so 
we supplement our direct sales force with a combination of manufacturers representatives and distributors in certain geographic areas 
we divide the world into four areas the americas  europe middle east africa  japan and asia pacific 
in the americas  we primarily sell our products directly in the united states 
in europe middle east  we sell our products directly in switzerland  germany  italy  france  the united kingdom and sweden 
in japan  we sell our higher end oscilloscope products directly and our lower end scopes and protocol analyzer products through distributors 
in asia pacific  we sell our products directly in south korea  singapore and five regions in china 
we generate revenue in a single segment within the test and measurement market  primarily from the sale of our oscilloscopes  protocol analyzers  probes  accessories  and applications solutions 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue from the sales of our extended warranty  maintenance contracts and repairs and calibrations on our instruments after their warranties expire 
generally  we transact revenues and pay our operating expenses in the local currencies of the countries in which we have a direct distribution presence or other operations  with limited exceptions  most notably in china where our sales and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars 
in europe middle east  we transact business in euros  swiss francs  british pounds  swedish krona and us dollars 
in japan  we transact business in japanese yen 
in south korea  we transact business in korean won and in singapore  we transact business in both us dollars and singapore dollars 
for a discussion of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure  see below  item a of this part ii entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

table of contents historically  we have  at times  experienced lower levels of demand during our first fiscal quarter than in other fiscal quarters which  we believe  have been principally due to the lower level of general market activity during the summer months  particularly in europe 
cost of revenues represents manufacturing and service costs  which primarily comprise materials  labor and factory overhead 
gross profit represents revenues less cost of revenues 
additional factors integral to gross profit earned on our products are mix  as the list prices of our products range from to  and the effects of foreign currencies  as approximately two thirds of our revenues are derived overseas  much of which is denominated in local currencies while product manufacturing costs are primarily us dollar denominated 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation  and related overhead costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel as well as legal  accounting and other professional services 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation  and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research  design and development activities  as well as the cost of masks  wafers and other materials and related test services and equipment used in the development process 
our results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors 
as discussed below  we believe the most significant recurring factors are the economic strength of the technology markets into which we sell our products  our ability to identify market demands and develop competitive products to meet those demands  the announcements and actions of our competitors and our ability to enter into new markets and broaden our presence in existing markets 
our sales are largely dependent on the health and growth of technology companies whose operations tend to be cyclical 
consequently  demand for our products tends to coincide with the increase or decrease in capital spending in the computer semiconductor consumer electronics  data storage  automotive industrial  and military aerospace industries 
in addition  in response to fluctuations in the technology markets we target  we continually assess and adopt programs aimed at positioning us for long term success 
these programs may include streamlining operations  discontinuing older and less profitable product lines  changing our future product strategy  and reducing operating expenses from time to time 
as an example  we implemented business realignment and restructuring initiatives intended to reduce costs and more efficiently allocate product development resources see note to the consolidated financial statements business realignment  restructuring initiatives and related asset impairments  for additional information 
we face significant competition in our target markets 
we believe that in order to continue to compete successfully  we need to anticipate  recognize and respond to changing market demands by providing products that serve our customers needs as they arise at prices acceptable to the market 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competition in each of these areas 
consequently  we are constantly reviewing our product development strategy and invest time  resources and capital in development projects we deem most likely to succeed 
in furtherance of our drive to meet our customers changing demands  we also look outside our organization for opportunities to expand our markets 
accordingly  on october  and october   we completed the acquisitions of computer access technology corporation catc and catalyst enterprises  inc catalyst  respectively  to complement our expanding portfolio of serial data test solutions 
this product line  protocol solutions group psg  now represents about of our total business 
in fiscal  we transformed our entire oscilloscope product lines by introducing a brand new line of waveaces on the low end and a new line of wavepros and wavemasters on the high end 
we also refreshed our low and mid range product lines by introducing updated versions of waverunners  wavesurfers and wavejet product lines 
we believe that our diversified product mix  along with continued enhancements  strategically positions us to expand our presence in the oscilloscope market 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s judgment and available information and  consequently  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  reserves on accounts receivable  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory  uncertain tax positions  valuation of deferred tax assets  valuation of long lived assets  valuation of goodwill  estimation of warranty liabilities and share based compensation expense 
revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products  services  and other arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenues from products are included in revenues from test and measurement products in the consolidated statements of operations  net of any applicable sales or value added taxes 
revenue from product sales  net of allowances for anticipated returns  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  or when services have been provided 
the price is considered fixed or determinable when it is not subject to refund or adjustments 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use relative fair values to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
due to the significant software content of our protocol analyzer products  we recognize revenue on the sale of these products upon shipment provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
software maintenance support revenue is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and recognized ratably over the maintenance support periods 
provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time sales of related products are recognized as revenue 
revenues from protocol analyzer products are included in test and measurement products in the consolidated statements of operations 
in an effort to provide end user customers an alternative to purchasing the company s higher end products under its standard terms and conditions  the company began offering customers an opportunity to enter into sales type or direct financing leases for these products 
the company is accounting for these leases in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
lease and rental revenues are reported within test and measurement product revenue 
reserves on accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for anticipated returns and doubtful accounts relating to the portion of the accounts receivable which we estimate is non collectible 
we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in the overall economic environment or in the financial condition of our customers may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
we assess the valuation of our inventory and provide an allowance for the value of estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
our marketing department plays a key role in our inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with our manufacturing department to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
based upon management s forecast  inventory items no longer expected to be used in the future are considered obsolete and the difference between an inventory s quantity and its forecasted usage are classified as excess 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances for excess or obsolete inventory may be required see note to the consolidated financial statements inventories  net for additional information 
uncertain tax positions 
the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations 
we reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
on july   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as amended by fasb staff position no 
fsp fin  definition of settlement in fasb interpretation 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
fin states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits 
the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit greater than likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
this measurement is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations 
a tax benefit from an uncertain position was previously recognized if it was probable of being sustained 
currently  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non current unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within twelve months of the reporting date see note to the consolidated financial statements income taxes for additional information 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  including fin liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
the company is required to recognize a valuation allowance for all or a portion of its deferred tax assets if it believes that it is not more likely than not  given the weight of all available evidence  that all or a portion of its deferred tax assets will be realized 
management assesses the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on actual and forecasted operating results 
the company assessed both its positive and negative evidence to determine the proper amount of its required valuation allowance 
factors considered include the company s current and cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions and management s projection that the company expects to utilize its domestic net operating loss carryforwards prior to the initial expiration in fiscal in the assessment for a valuation allowance  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  excess of appreciated asset value over the basis of net assets  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  the company s experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  and tax planning alternatives 
the 
table of contents company s analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that the company has incurred a cumulative loss for its domestic operations over the recent years  which was principally due to a non recurring goodwill impairment charge as well as acquisition and business realignment charges 
the company believes it will be able to realize all of its domestic deferred tax assets  net of the million valuation allowance 
consideration has also been given to the period over which these net deferred tax assets can be realized  and the company s history of not having federal tax loss carryforwards expire unused 
in addition  the company has considered tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible that will be implemented in a timely manner  if necessary  which will allow the company to recognize the future tax attributes by increasing taxable income in the united states 
a valuation allowance of approximately million and million existed as of june  and june   respectively  for certain tax credit carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards and foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of these deferred tax assets 
during the year ended june   the valuation allowance increased by approximately million 
the increase was mainly due to an increase in foreign net operating loss carryforwards and uncertainty surrounding the utilization of such carryforwards 
during the year ended june   the valuation allowance increased by approximately million 
the increase was due to an increase in state investment tax credit carryforwards  which remain uncertain in their utilization  changes in gross deferred tax assets due to the adoption of fin on july   and partially offset by decreases in the valuation allowance due to the utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  and changes surrounding the utilization of such foreign deferred tax assets 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of the company s net deductible temporary differences  net of the valuation allowance 
the factors that management considered in assessing the likelihood of realization included  the forecast of future taxable income  reversal of taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
management will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets at each interim and annual balance sheet date based on actual and forecasted operating results 
adjustments to the valuation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the realizable amount of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets is greater or less than the amount recorded 
such adjustments may be material to the company s financial position  and results of operations 
at june   the company s net domestic deferred tax assets amounted to approximately million 
management has considered the realizability of the deferred tax assets and has concluded that a domestic valuation allowance of approximately million should be recorded  mainly related to certain state investment tax credit carryforwards that are not anticipated to be realized 
although management determined that a valuation allowance was not required with respect to most of the net domestic deferred tax assets  recovery is primarily dependent on achieving the forecast of future operating income  as well as prudent tax planning strategies 
at june   the company requires approximately million in cumulative domestic future operating income to be generated at various times in the future to realize the domestic net deferred tax assets 
based upon the projections  the domestic net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards would be fully utilized before expiration see note to the consolidated financial statements income taxes for additional information 
valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amounts exceed the fair value 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance by us relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends see note to the consolidated financial statements goodwill  intangible assets  net  and other non current assets for additional information 

table of contents valuation of goodwill 
goodwill is to be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might be impaired 
impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
a reporting unit is defined as the same as or one level below the operating segment level as described in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company has one reporting unit  in the test and measurement business  because none of the components of the company constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which company management regularly reviews the results of operations 
in fiscal  the company changed its annual impairment testing date from fiscal year end to the last day of the eleventh month of the fiscal year 
the company believes the last day of the eleventh month of the fiscal year is preferable as it provides the company additional time to complete the impairment test and report the results of that test in the company s annual filing on form k 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires management to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value 
testing is required between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
such an event may occur if  for an extended period of time  the market value of the company s common stock plus a control premium were less than the carrying value of the company 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary  and the amount of the impairment charge  involves significant judgment around the assumptions used to determine the impairment charge 
fiscal in fiscal  as a result of the decline in our stock price since june   which affected our market capitalization  we updated our goodwill impairment test as of september   december   and march  respectively  to identify whether a potential impairment of our recorded goodwill existed 
for the first quarter ended september  our market capitalization  without regard to a control premium  exceeded our carrying value 
for the second quarter testing as of december   the fair value of our reporting unit was determined to be million  using a control premium  which exceeded our carrying amount by million  or 
for the third quarter testing as of march   the fair value of our reporting unit was determined to be million  using a control premium  which exceeded our carrying amount by million  or 
for the fourth quarter testing as of may   the fair value of our reporting unit was determined to be million  using a control premium  which exceeded our carrying amount by million  or 
a control premium was utilized in our second quarter  third quarter and annual goodwill impairment testing 
this control premium was not a standard amount based on broad assumptions  rather  the amount was based on detailed analysis that considered appropriate industry  market  economic and other pertinent factors  including  indications of such premiums from data on recent acquisition transactions 
the control premium is reviewed periodically  taking into consideration current industry  market and economic conditions along with other factors or available information specific to the company s business 
we determined that there was no impairment to the recorded goodwill balances in fiscal we did  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  reduce the goodwill by approximately million as a result of a reversal of a pre acquisition tax contingency reserve 
additionally  upon adoption of fin on july   some accruals for uncertain tax positions related to the acquisition of catc were reduced  resulting in a decrease to goodwill of approximately million 
fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we updated our goodwill impairment test as of september   and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit was approximately million  using a control premium  which exceeded our carrying amount by approximately million  or 
in the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of the deterioration in the economic environment and sustained decline in our stock price  which affected our market capitalization  we updated the first step of our goodwill impairment test and determined 
table of contents that our carrying value exceeded our fair value  indicating that goodwill was impaired 
we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test which calculated the implied fair value of the goodwill by allocating our fair value determined in the first step to all assets and liabilities other than goodwill  including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets  and compared the residual amount to our carrying amount of goodwill in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded approximately million of goodwill impairment  resulting in a carrying value of goodwill as of june  of zero see note to the consolidated financial statements goodwill  intangible assets  net  and other non current assets for additional information 
warranty liabilities 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are derived from historical data of product reliability and for certain new products  third party published expected failure rates 
the expected failure is arrived at in terms of units  which are then converted into labor hours to which an average fully burdened cost per hour is applied to derive the amount of accrued warranty required 
on a quarterly basis  we study trends of warranty claims  review estimates of costs to repair and take action to improve the quality of our products and minimize our warranty exposure 
management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve  which may be material to our results of operations when made see note to the consolidated financial statements warranties and guarantees for additional information 
share based compensation expense 
we recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in the financial statements at their fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights 
the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant  while the fair value for stock appreciation rights is estimated on the date of grant and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period  since they are liability classified 
determining the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights requires certain estimates by management including the expected volatility and expected term of the option 
management also makes decisions regarding the risk free interest rate used in the model and makes estimates regarding forfeiture rates 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate or if we reevaluate the forfeiture rate in the future  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current periods 
further  fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost see note to the consolidated financial statements share based compensation for additional information

table of contents business realignment  restructuring initiatives and related asset impairments the table below summarizes the charges for business realignment  restructuring initiatives and related asset impairments for the fiscal years ended  and see note to the consolidated financial statements business realignment  restructuring initiatives and related asset impairments for additional information 
in thousands years ended june  june  june  charges for impaired intangible assets severance and related costs cost of revenues charges for severance and related costs research and development charges for impaired intangible asset severance and related costs facility closure lease restructure selling  general and administrative comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were approximately million for the year ended june   compared to approximately million in the prior year  representing a decrease of  or approximately million  primarily as a result of a measurable decline in sales of test and measurement products driven by the worldwide economic downturn  as well as negative foreign currency impact 
foreign currency fluctuations decreased total revenues by approximately million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal our sales were impacted by our customers reducing staffing levels and therefore their need for capital equipment  as well as postponing spending  mostly for our mid range oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers 
service and other revenues primarily consist of service revenues and maintenance fees 
service and other revenues were approximately million for the year ended june   representing a decrease of or approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in upgrade purchases furthered by the economic downturn  as customers delayed or cancelled servicing of their products  as well as negative foreign currency impact 
our geographic breakdown of revenues by area in total dollars and as a percentage of total revenues is as follows dollars in thousands june  june  percentage june  june  percentage americas europe middle east japan asia pacific total revenues 
table of contents for the year end june   the geographic revenues in terms of dollars were lower in all regions due to the worldwide economic downturn and negative foreign currency impact 
gross profit for the year ended june  was approximately million  or gross margin  compared to million  or gross margin  for the same period last year 
the lower gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreased demand for our test and measurement products  and greater discounting practices necessary to drive sales in an economic downturn  partially offset by increased sales of our higher end products which slightly improved margins 
also contributing to the lower gross margins in fiscal was million of costs associated with an inventory write down  as a result of a change in our product strategy due to deteriorating market conditions and approximately million in severance costs  as a result of our realignment initiatives 
the gross margin in fiscal included approximately million for inventory write downs 
absent these charges in both years  fiscal margins as a percentage of sales were  as compared to for fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal  representing a decrease of or approximately million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to our extensive cost reduction program that began in the second quarter of fiscal which included reductions in workforce  compensation and other employee benefits 
also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in our share based compensation expense of approximately million  as a result of the reduction in fair value of the stock appreciation rights sars 
these cost reductions more than offset approximately million of business realignment and restructuring costs in the current year for severance and lease charges 
in fiscal  the catalyst trade name failed the intangible asset impairment test due to a change in our product strategy  and accordingly we took a non cash charge of approximately million 
additionally  there was approximately million of business realignment charges in the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily as a result of a lower sales base 
research and development r d expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of or approximately million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to our extensive cost reduction program that began in the second quarter of fiscal  partially offset by approximately million of business realignment charges 
as a percentage of total revenues  r d expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily as a result of a lower sales base in fiscal impairment of goodwill was approximately million in fiscal  representing the write off of our goodwill balance associated with our catalyst and catc acquisitions 
this resulted from the sustained decline in our stock price  which affected our market capitalization and reduced the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount 
as of june   no goodwill remains on our consolidated balance sheet 
other income expense  net  consists primarily of a gain on the extinguishment of our convertible debt  net of issue cost write off  interest income and expense and foreign exchange gains and losses 
in fiscal  there was a total net gain of approximately million  compared to a total net loss of approximately million in fiscal in  we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of convertible debt  net of issue cost write offs  of approximately million  resulting from the repurchase of approximately million in convertible notes  compared to a gain of approximately million in fiscal from the repurchase of million in convertible notes 
net interest expense  which decreased in fiscal as a result of our purchases of convertible notes at a discount  was approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additionally  we recorded net foreign exchange gains of approximately million in fiscal compared to a net loss of approximately million in the prior year  resulting from the changes in our foreign exchange forward contracts and on transactions denominated in other than our functional currencies 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal includes a reduction of the tax benefit of approximately million related to the impairment of goodwill that is not amortizable for tax purposes  an increase in the tax benefit of approximately million resulting from the true up of the prior year s tax accrual upon filing the actual tax returns related to research 
table of contents and development tax credits  an increase in the tax benefit of approximately million from the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  and a reduction of the tax benefit of approximately million for the write down of the deferred tax asset related to restricted stock grants that resulted in a shortfall of cumulative tax benefits 
the effective tax rate for fiscal includes the effect of a reduction of tax expense of approximately million resulting from both the final true up of the prior year s tax accrual upon filing the actual tax returns and an election for certain r d credits made by the company in the second quarter of fiscal  a reduction of tax expense of approximately million from the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  and an increase in tax expense of approximately million for the write down of the deferred tax asset related to restricted stock grants that resulted in a shortfall of cumulative tax benefits  all of which were treated as discrete items 
the company calculates income tax expense benefit based upon an annual estimated effective tax rate that includes estimates and assumptions that may change 
the differences between the annual estimated effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate of principally result from the company s geographical distribution of taxable income  and differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items 
comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were approximately million for the year ended june   compared to approximately million in the fiscal  representing an increase of  or approximately million  primarily as a result of increased sales of test and measurement products and positive foreign currency impact 
foreign currency fluctuations increased total revenues by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in test and measurement products was driven mainly by increased oscilloscope product shipments as a result of an improved distribution channel and the incremental impact from the catalyst acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal  which was approximately of revenues 
these increases were partially offset by decreased demand and softness in orders from japan 
service and other revenues primarily consist of service revenues and maintenance fees 
service and other revenues were approximately million for the year ended june   representing an increase of or approximately million  as compared to approximately million for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of a company wide service initiative that began during fiscal to improve customer service by focusing on opportunities to add value to our products  positive foreign currency impact and an improved distribution channel 
our geographic breakdown of revenues by area in total dollars and as a percentage of total revenues is as follows in thousands june  june  percentage june  june  percentage americas europe middle east japan asia pacific total revenues for the year end june   the geographic revenues in terms of dollars were higher in all regions except japan 
the increases in europe middle east and asia pacific were driven by strong distribution channels and improved sales productivity  as well as favorable foreign currency impact 
improved performance in the americas resulted from our reorganized distribution channel  including a network of manufacturers representatives 
foreign currency fluctuations increased europe middle east revenues by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were offset by decreases in japan  primarily from the realignment of our japan operations at the end of fiscal and local economic conditions 

table of contents gross profit for the year ended june  was approximately million  or gross margin  compared to million  or gross margin  for the same period last year 
the lower gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to approximately million of costs associated with an inventory write down  including inventory recorded at fair value in the purchase accounting for catalyst and the elimination of a product line  million of costs associated with the sell through of stepped up inventory acquired in the catalyst acquisition  million relating to the implementation of a business realignment and million charge for the impairment of an intangible asset 
the gross margin in fiscal included approximately million for inventory write downs 
approximately million resulted from a change in the company s product strategy and approximately million related to certain inventory recorded at fair value in the purchase accounting for catalyst  a portion of which we were indemnified 
this charge was partially offset by a reduction in amortization expense for an acquired catalyst intangible asset of approximately million 
absent these charges in both years  fiscal margins as a percentage of sales were consistent with the fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal  representing a decrease of or approximately million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in general spending levels  resulting from the prior year s cost cutting efforts 
business realignment charges in fiscal were approximately million 
additionally  the catalyst trade name failed the intangible asset impairment test due to a change in our product strategy  and accordingly we took a non cash charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal business realignment and restructuring charges in fiscal were approximately million  prompted by the acquisition of catalyst as well as the reorganization of our japan facility

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we purchase materials from suppliers and sell our products around the world and maintain investments in foreign subsidiaries  all denominated in a variety of currencies 
as a consequence  we are exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to a number of currencies  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  and political instability 
among the more significant potential risks to us of relative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is the relationship among and between the us dollar  euro  swiss franc  british pound  swedish krona  japanese yen  korean won and singapore dollar 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as third party vendor payments  revenues and intercompany payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows  we have a program of entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to decrease the risks associated with currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of us or our subsidiaries 
it cannot be assured  however  that this program will effectively offset all of our foreign currency risk related to these assets or liabilities 
these foreign exchange forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities sfas no 

other than this program  we do not attempt to reduce our foreign currency exchange risks by entering into foreign currency management programs 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future resulting in mismatches between local currency revenues and expenses  the translation of foreign currencies into the us dollar  our financial reporting currency  or otherwise  will not adversely affect our results of operations 
moreover  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect the demand for our products 
during fiscal   and  foreign currency exchange gains and losses on both forward contracts and on transactions denominated in other than the subsidiaries functional currencies was a net gain of approximately million  a net loss of approximately million  and a net loss of approximately million  respectively 
these net gains and losses are included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
at june  and june   the notional amounts of the company s open foreign exchange forward contracts  all with maturities of less than six months  were approximately million and million  respectively  with a net unrealized gain of approximately million and zero  respectively 
we performed a sensitivity analysis at june   assuming a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates on our open foreign exchange forward contracts and our assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies 
we estimate that as of june   a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in an incremental expense of approximately million  after tax on these instruments and therefore  on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows from operations 
on october   we completed the sale of million of convertible senior notes the notes due october  the notes will pay interest semiannually through maturity and will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock 
the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
upon conversion of the notes  holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each note  and any excess conversion value will be delivered in cash or shares of our common stock  at our option 
during fiscal and  we repurchased approximately million and million  respectively  of the outstanding convertible notes  resulting in a balance of approximately million and million at june  and june   respectively 
as of june  and june   the market value of the convertible notes was approximately million and million  respectively 
we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates primarily due to our investment in cash and cash equivalents  as well as  our million credit facility 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  which would have been an incremental charge of approximately million  after tax  to our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in fiscal
