item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled risk factors  forward looking statements  and selected consolidated financial information of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries and the historical consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries  including related notes  included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation that was formed in june to invest in multi family and commercial real estate related bridge  junior participating interests in first mortgages  mezzanine loans  preferred and direct equity and  in limited cases  discounted mortgage notes and other real estate related assets  which we refer to collectively as structured finance investments 
we have also invested in mortgage related securities 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors net interest income earned on our investments net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings 
if the yield earned on our assets decreases or the cost of borrowings increases  this will have a negative impact on earnings 
however  if the yield earned on our assets increases or the cost of borrowings decreases  this will have a positive impact on earnings 
net interest income is also directly impacted by the size of our asset portfolio 
credit quality of our assets effective asset and portfolio management is essential to maximizing the performance and value of a real estate mortgage investment 
maintaining the credit quality of our loans and investments is of critical importance 
loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings and liquidity 
cost control we seek to minimize our operating costs  which consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs  management fees and other general and administrative expenses 
if there are increases in foreclosures and non performing loans and investments  certain of these expenses  particularly employee compensation expenses and asset management related expenses  may increase 
we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its reit taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders provided that at least of its reit taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
certain of our assets that produce non qualifying income may be held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
unlike other subsidiaries of a reit  the income of a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes 
we did not record a provision for income taxes related to the assets that are held in taxable reit subsidiaries for the year ended december  on july   acm  our manager  contributed million of structured finance assets  encumbered by million of borrowings in exchange for an equity interest in our operating partnership represented by  units of limited partnership interest and  warrants to acquire additional units of limited partnership interest 
in addition  certain employees of acm became our employees 
we are externally managed and advised by acm and pay acm a management fee in accordance with a management agreement 
acm originates  underwrites and services all structured finance assets on behalf of our operating partnership 
concurrently with acm s asset contribution  we consummated a private placement of million units  each consisting of five shares of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock  for per unit  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
gross proceeds from the private placement combined with the concurrent equity contribution by acm totaled approximately million in equity capital 
on april   we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and the other estimated 
table of contents offering expenses 
on may   we issued and sold  additional shares of common stock  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount pursuant to the exercise of a portion of the over allotment option granted to the underwriters of our initial public offering 
as of december   we issued  shares of common stock from the exercise of warrants originally issued as a component of units on july   for proceeds of million 
in addition  in june  we issued  shares of common stock in a public offering 
sources of operating revenues we derive our operating revenues primarily through interest received from making real estate related bridge  mezzanine and junior participation loans and preferred equity investments 
interest income earned on these loans and investments represented approximately   and of our total revenues in   and  respectively 
interest income is also derived from profits of equity participation interests 
in  and interest income from participation interests represented approximately   and of total revenues  respectively 
we also derive interest income from our investments in cre mortgage related securities 
interest on these investments represented of our total revenues in and less than of our total revenues in and property operating income is derived from our real estate owned 
in  property operating income represented of total revenue 
no such income was recognized in and in addition  we derived operating revenue from income from swap derivatives  which represented income from interest rate swaps on junior subordinated notes relating to trust preferred securities 
in  income from swap derivatives represented less than of our total revenues 
there was no such revenue in and additionally  we derive operating revenues from other income that represents loan structuring and miscellaneous asset management fees associated with our loans and investments portfolio 
revenue from other income represented less than of our total revenues in  and loss income from equity affiliates and gain on sale of loans and real estate we derive income from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that were formed with equity partners to acquire  develop and or sell real estate assets 
these joint ventures are not majority owned or controlled by us  and are not consolidated in our financial statements 
these investments are recorded under either the equity or cost method of accounting as appropriate 
we record our share of net income and losses from the underlying properties on a single line item in the consolidated statements of operations as loss income from equity affiliates 
in  loss from equity affiliates totaled million 
in and  income from equity affiliates totaled million and million  respectively 
we also may derive income from the gain on sale of loans and real estate 
we may acquire real estate for our own investment and  upon stabilization  disposition at an anticipated return and real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest certain assets from its portfolio 
no such income has been recorded to date 
significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of 
table of contents operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
loans and investments statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas requires that at the time of purchase  we designate a security as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading depending on ability and intent 
we do not have any trading securities at this time 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value  while securities and investments held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
unrealized losses that are determined to be other than temporary are recognized in earnings in accordance with sfas the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process requiring judgments and assumptions 
the process may include  but is not limited to  assessment of recent market events and prospects for near term recovery  assessment of cash flows  internal review of the underlying assets securing the investments  credit of the issuer and the rating of the security  as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment 
we closely monitor market conditions on which we base such decisions 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  we also assess certain of our held to maturity securities  other than those of high credit quality  to determine whether significant changes in estimated cash flows or unrealized losses on these securities  if any  reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary and  accordingly  written down to its fair value against earnings 
on a quarterly basis  we review these changes in estimated cash flows  which could occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  to determine if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process requiring judgments and assumptions 
we calculate a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of the investment  including any other than temporary impairments recognized to date  and the revised yield is then applied prospectively to recognize interest income 
loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts  and net of the allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we invest in preferred equity interests that  in some cases  allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate 
to date  management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported as loans 
impaired loans and allowance for loan losses loans are considered impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
specific valuation allowances are established for impaired loans based on the fair value of collateral on an individual loan basis 
the fair value of the collateral is determined by selecting the most appropriate valuation methodology  or methodologies  among several generally available and accepted in the commercial real estate industry 
the determination of the most appropriate valuation methodology is based on the key characteristics of the collateral type 
these methodologies include the evaluation of operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period  and estimated sales value of the collateral computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net operating income of the specific property  less selling costs  discounted at market discount rates 
if upon completion of the valuation  the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  an allowance is created with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for each loan is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses 
we had a million allowance for loan losses at december  related to ten loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value  net of reserves  of approximately million 
at december   we had a million allowance for loan losses related to two loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value  net of reserves  of approximately million 

table of contents repurchase obligations in certain circumstances  we have financed the purchase of investments from a counterparty through a repurchase agreement with that same counterparty 
we currently record these investments in the same manner as other investments financed with repurchase agreements  with the investment recorded as an asset and the related borrowing under the repurchase agreement as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
interest income earned on the investments and interest expense incurred on the repurchase obligations are reported separately on the consolidated statement of operations 
these transactions may not qualify as a purchase by us under fsp fas which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we would be required to present the net investment on our balance sheet as a derivative with the corresponding change in fair value of the derivative being recorded in the statement of operations 
the value of the derivative would reflect not only changes in the value of the underlying investment  but also changes in the value of the underlying credit provided by the counterparty 
see note summary of significant accounting policies recently issued accounting pronouncements of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
capitalized interest we capitalize interest in accordance with sfas no 
capitalization of interest costs in financial statements that include investments accounted for by the equity method 
this statement amended sfas no 
capitalization of interest costs to include investments equity  loans and advances accounted for by the equity method as qualifying assets of the investor while the investee has activities in progress necessary to commence its planned principal operations  provided that the investee s activities include the use of funds to acquire qualifying assets for its operations 
one of our joint ventures  which is accounted for using the equity method  has used funds to acquire qualifying assets for its planned principal operations 
during  the joint venture sold both of the acquired properties and we discontinued the capitalization of interest on its remaining investment in the joint venture as activities required under sfas no 
ceased to continue 
we capitalized million and million of interest during the years ended december  and  respectively  relating to this investment 
we did not capitalize interest during the year ended december  revenue recognition interest income 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned from loans  investments and securities 
in many instances  the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed  an origination fee  and deferred interest upon maturity 
in some cases  interest income may also include the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts arising from the purchase or origination of the loan or security 
this additional income  net of any direct loan origination costs incurred  is deferred and accreted into interest income on an effective yield or interest method adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the life of the related loan or security as a yield adjustment 
income recognition is suspended for loans when  in the opinion of management  a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed 
several of the loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates  which differ from current payment terms 
interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible  based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower 
if management cannot make this determination regarding collectibility  interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt 
additionally  interest income is recorded when earned from equity participation interests  referred to as equity kickers 
these equity kickers have the potential to generate additional revenues to us as a result of excess cash flows being distributed and or as appreciated properties are sold or refinanced 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded million  million and million of interest on such loans and investments  respectively 
property operating income 
property operating income represents operating income associated with the operations of an office building recorded as real estate owned  net 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of property operating income relating to real estate owned 
there was no property operating income in or 
table of contents stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the related stock based award in accordance with sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  sfas r 
we measure the compensation costs for these shares as of the date of the grant  with subsequent re measurement for any unvested shares granted to non employees with such amounts expensed against earnings  at the grant date for the portion that vest immediately or ratably over the respective vesting periods 
the cost of these grants is amortized over the vesting term using an accelerated method in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock options or award plans fin  and sfas r 
dividends are paid on the restricted shares as dividends are paid on shares of our common stock whether or not they are vested 
stock based compensation was disclosed in our consolidated statement of operations under employee compensation and benefits for employees and under selling and administrative expense for non employees 
income taxes we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders  provided that at least of taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
certain of our assets that produce non qualifying income are held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
unlike other subsidiaries of a reit  the income of a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes 
in july  the fasb released interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fas this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
this interpretation was effective january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial results 
variable interest entities in december  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r as a revision to fin no 
 which requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary pb 
the pb is the party that absorbs a majority of the vie s anticipated losses and or a majority of the expected returns 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our loans and investments and investments in equity affiliates to determine whether they are vies 
this evaluation resulted in us determining that our bridge loans  junior participation loans  mezzanine loans  preferred equity investments and investments in equity affiliates were potential variable interests 
for each of these investments  we have evaluated the sufficiency of the fair value of the entities equity investments at risk to absorb losses  that as a group the holders of the equity investments at risk have a the direct or indirect ability through voting rights to make decisions about the entities significant activities  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity and their obligations are not protected directly or indirectly  c the right to receive the expected residual return of the entity and their rights are not capped  substantially all of the entities activities do not involve or are not conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately fewer voting rights in terms of its obligation to absorb the expected losses or its right to receive expected residual returns of the entity  or both 
entities that issue junior subordinated notes are considered vies 
however  it is not appropriate to consolidate these entities under the provisions of fin as equity interests are variable interests only to the extent that the investment is considered to be at risk 
since our investments were funded by the entities that issued the junior subordinated notes  they are not considered to be at risk 
in addition  we have evaluated our investments in 
table of contents collateralized debt obligation securities and have determined that the issuing entities are considered vies under the provisions of fin  but have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary 
as of december   we have identified loans and investments which were made to entities determined to be vies 
however  for the vies identified  we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiaries and as such the vies should not be consolidated in our financial statements 
for all other investments  we have determined they are not vies 
as such  we have continued to account for these loans and investments as a loan or joint venture  as appropriate 
a summary of our identified vies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with sfas no 
 the carrying values of interest rate swaps and the underlying hedged liabilities are reflected at their fair value 
as of december  we have retained the services of chatham financial corporation  a statement on auditing standards no 
sas  service organizations compliant  third party financial services company to determine these fair values 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
derivatives that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
because the valuations of our hedging activities are based on estimates  the fair value may change if our estimates are inaccurate 
for the effect of hypothetical changes in market interest rates on our interest rate swaps  see interest rate risk in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  set forth in item a hereof 
fair value measurements we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities effective january  this standard defines fair value  provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures 
this standard does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable  willing parties 
a liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor  not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor 
where available  fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters 
where observable prices or inputs are not available  valuation models are applied 
these valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment  the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity 
assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value 
hierarchical levels  defined by sfas and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities  are as follows level inputs are unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
the types of assets and liabilities carried at level fair value generally are government and agency securities  equities listed in active markets  investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and listed derivatives 
level inputs other than quoted prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
level inputs include quoted market prices in markets that are not active for an identical or similar asset or liability  and quoted market prices in active markets for a similar asset or liability 
fair valued assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are non government securities  municipal bonds  certain hybrid financial instruments  certain mortgage and asset backed 
table of contents securities including cdo bonds  certain corporate debt  certain commitments and guarantees  certain private equity investments and certain derivatives 
level inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
these valuations are based on significant unobservable inputs that require a considerable amount of judgment and assumptions 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
generally  assets and liabilities carried at fair value and included in this category are certain mortgage and asset backed securities  certain corporate debt  certain private equity investments  certain municipal bonds  certain commitments and guarantees and certain derivatives 
determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment and we evaluate its hierarchy disclosures each quarter 
at december   we measured certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis  including available for sale securities and derivative financial instruments 
fair values of our derivative financial instruments were approximated on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions 
these items were included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
in accordance with sfas  we incorporated credit valuation adjustments in the fair values of its derivative financial instruments to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk 
in addition  the fair value of our available for sale securities were approximated on current market quotes received from financial sources that trade such securities 
at december   we measured certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  including loans and securities held to maturity 
fair values of loans were estimated using discounted cash flow methodology  using discount rates  which  in the opinion of management  best reflect current market interest rates that would be offered for loans with similar characteristics and credit quality 
loans are designated as held for investment and are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts  and net of the allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we consider a loan impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we perform evaluations of its loans to determine if the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  which may result in an allowance and corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
in addition  the fair values of our securities held to maturity were approximated on current market quotes received from financial sources that trade such securities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our financial condition or results of operations  see note summary of significant accounting policies recently issued accounting pronouncements of the notes to consolidated financial statements  set forth in item hereof 
changes in financial condition our loan portfolio balance  including our held to maturity securities  decreased million  or  to billion at december   with a weighted average current interest pay rate of  as compared to billion  with a weighted average current interest pay rate of  at december  at december   advances on financing facilities totaled billion  with a weighted average funding cost of  as compared to billion  with a weighted average funding cost of at december  in  we originated loans and investments totaling million  of which million was funded as of december  we also purchased seven cre collateralized debt obligation bond securities at a discounted price of approximately million with a face amount of approximately million 
of the new loans and investments  eight were bridge loans totaling million  four were mezzanine loans totaling 
table of contents million  and one was a junior participating interest totaling million 
we have received full satisfaction of loans totaling million  partial repayment on loans totaling million and loans were refinanced during the year totaling million 
in addition  loans totaling approximately million were extended in accordance with the extension options of the corresponding loan agreements 
since december   we have not originated any loans 
we have received million for the repayment in full of four loans  all of which were loans on properties that were either sold or refinanced outside of arbor 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
the decrease was primarily due to approximately a million increase in funding of additional cash collateral for a portion of our interest rate swaps whose value has declined as a result of reductions in the projected libor rates 
restricted cash decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  restricted cash is kept on deposit with the trustees for our collateralized debt obligations cdos  and primarily represents proceeds from loan repayments which will be used to purchase replacement loans as collateral for the cdos 
the decrease was primarily due to the redeployment of funds during from proceeds received near the end of from the full satisfaction of loans held in the cdo and the transfer of loans from other financing facilities to the cdos 
other assets increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in funding additional cash collateral for a portion of our interest rate swaps whose value has declined as a result of reductions in the projected libor rates 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further information relating to our derivatives 
the increase was also due to a million third party member receivable recorded during the second quarter of in connection with the prime outlets member llc pom transaction 
this amount reflects the third party member s pro rata portion of the million debt recorded from the consolidated entity in notes payable at december  in addition  in  we paid approximately million of margin calls related to the financing of certain held to maturity securities  as well as a million increase in the fair value of non qualifying cdo basis swaps 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in deferred financing costs associated with the amortization of costs associated with our financing sources 
securities held to maturity were million at december   and reflects the purchase of million of investment grade cre collateralized debt obligation bonds for million during the second quarter of a portion of the million discount received on the purchases of these bonds will be accreted into interest income on an effective yield adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the estimated life remaining of years of the securities as a yield adjustment 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that one bond  with an amortized cost of approximately million  was other than temporarily impaired  resulting in a million impairment charge to our financial statements 
we did not have any securities held to maturity at december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof for a further description of these transactions 
real estate owned  net was million at december   representing the net carrying value of an office property which we foreclosed on during the second quarter of in addition  we recorded a million first lien on the property in mortgage notes payable 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof for a further description of these transactions 
prepaid management fee increased million  or  to million at december  due to a million incentive management fee paid on the million of cash received in june from the agreement to transfer of our interest in pom  one of our equity affiliates 
upon the closing of this transaction  which is expected to occur on or before june   we will exchange our interest in pom for approximately million of preferred and common operating partnership units in another reit  at which time the deferred management fee will be recognized as expense 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof for further description of this transaction 

table of contents other liabilities increased million  or  from million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in unrealized losses on the fair value of our interest rate swaps  due to a reduction in libor rates  with a corresponding offset to other comprehensive loss 
in  we recorded million in other than temporary impairment charges against our available for sale securities  shares of common stock of cbre realty finance  inc  representing an adjustment to their fair value at december  these securities had a fair value of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
as of december   these securities have been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap require that these securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary  though it is not intended to indicate a permanent decline in value 
we believe that based on recent market events and the unfavorable prospects for near term recovery of value  that there is a lack of evidence to support the conclusion that the fair value decline is temporary 
prior to the third quarter of  changes in the fair market value of our available for sale securities were considered unrealized gains or losses and were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
in june  acm  our manager  exercised its right to redeem its  operating partnership units in the operating partnership for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
as a result  acm s operating partnership ownership interest in us was reduced to zero and the balance of minority interest was charged directly to equity in additional paid in capital  as of june  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof for a further description of this transaction 
in june  we issued an aggregate of  shares of restricted common stock under the stock incentive plan to certain employees of ours and acm 
one third of the  shares of restricted stock granted to each of the employees were vested as of the date of grant  another one third will vest in june  and the remaining third will vest in june in april   restricted shares were issued to non management members of the board of directors under the stock incentive plan 
one third of the restricted stock granted was vested as of the date of grant  another one third will vest in april  and the remaining third will vest in april in april  we issued  shares of restricted common stock under the stock incentive plan to certain employees of ours and acm

this was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on the assets from in to in this decrease in yield was the result of a decrease in libor over the same period and a reduction in the yield on new originations compared to higher yielding loan payoffs from the same period in this was partially offset by a portion of our portfolio having libor floors and fixed rates of interest 
in addition  interest income from cash equivalents decreased million to million for compared to million for as a result of decreased average restricted and unrestricted cash balances as well as lower interest rates

provision for income taxes we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code 
as a reit  we generally are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income which is distributed to our stockholders  provided that at least of the taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all reit requirements and  therefore  have not provided for income tax expense on our reit taxable income for the year ended december  and we also have certain investments in taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to federal and state income taxes 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded a million and million provision  respectively  on income from these taxable reit subsidiaries

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the ability to meet potential cash requirements 
our short term and long term liquidity needs include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund future loans and investments  fund additional cash collateral from potential declines in the value of a portion of our interest rate swaps  fund operating costs and distributions to our stockholders as well as other general business needs 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity offerings  debt facilities and cash flows from operations 
our equity sources consist of funds raised from our private equity offering in july  net proceeds from our initial public offering of our common stock in april  net proceeds from our public offering of our common stock in june and depending on market conditions  proceeds from capital market transactions including the future issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
our debt facilities include the issuance of floating rate notes resulting from our cdos  the issuance of junior subordinated notes to subsidiary trusts issuing preferred securities and borrowings under credit agreements 
net cash provided by operating activities include interest income from our loan and investment portfolio reduced by interest expense on our debt facilities  cash from equity participation interests  repayments of outstanding loans and investments and funds from junior loan participation arrangements 
we believe our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term and long term liquidity needs 
our loans and investments are financed under existing credit facilities and their credit status is continuously monitored  therefore  these loans and investments are expected to generate a generally stable return 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
if we are unable to renew our sources of financing on substantially similar terms or at all  it would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
any decision by our lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our financial performance  compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
recent conditions in capital and credit markets have made certain forms of financing less attractive  and in certain cases less available  therefore we will continue to rely on cash flows provided by operating and investing activities for working capital and potential changes in dividend policy in our efforts towards capital preservation 

table of contents to maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income 
these distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations 
however  we believe that our capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements 
in december  the irs issued revenue procedure that allows listed reits to offer shareholders elective stock dividends  which are paid in a combination of cash and common stock with at least of the total distribution paid in cash  to satisfy the dividend requirement through equity offerings our authorized capital provides for the issuance of up to million shares of common stock  par value per share  and million shares of preferred stock  par value per share 
in march  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec under the act with respect to an aggregate of million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants  that may be sold by us from time to time pursuant to rule of the act 
on april   the commission declared this shelf registration statement effective 
in june  we sold  shares of our common stock registered on the shelf registration statement in a public offering at a price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and the other estimated offering expenses 
we used the proceeds to pay down debt and finance our loan and investment portfolio 
the underwriters did not exercise their over allotment option for additional shares 
in august  we entered into an equity placement program sales agreement with a securities agent whereby we may issue and sell up to three million shares of our common stock through the agent who agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell such shares during the term of the agreement and under the terms set forth therein 
to date  we have not utilized this equity placement program 
at december   we had million available under the shelf registration described above and  shares outstanding 
debt facilities we also maintain liquidity through two term credit agreements  one of which has a revolving credit component  three master repurchase agreements  one working capital facility  one note payable  three junior loan participations and one bridge loan warehousing credit agreement with seven different financial institutions or companies 
in addition  we have issued three collateralized debt obligations or cdos and nine separate junior subordinated notes

repurchase agreements provide stand alone financing for certain assets and interim  or warehouse financing  for assets that we plan to contribute to our cdos

we have a million repurchase agreement with a financial institution  effective october  which was amended in december to increase the committed amount of the facility to million from million 
the agreement has a term expiring in october and bears interest at pricing over libor  varying on the type of asset financed 
at december   the outstanding balance under this facility was million with a current weighted average note rate of we have a million repurchase agreement with a second institution that bears interest at pricing over libor and had a maturity date of september in january  we were notified that no further advances could be taken under this facility 
the facility matured in september and  under the terms of the repurchase agreement  the facility was to be paid in its entirety by december in december  we amended this facility extending the maturity to june the amendment also includes an increase in interest rate pricing over libor to basis points  a paydown of million by january  and full repayment of the facility by june at december   the aggregate outstanding balance under this facility was million with a current weighted average note rate of

we have an uncommitted master repurchase agreement with a third financial institution  effective april  entered into for the purpose of financing our cre cdo bond securities 
the agreement has a term expiring in may and bears interest at pricing over libor  varying on the type of asset financed 
during the year ended december   we paid approximately million of margin calls related to certain assets financed in this facility  due to a decrease in values associated with a change in market interest rate spreads 
at december   the outstanding balance under this facility was million with a current weighted average note rate of 
we had a million master repurchase agreement with nomura credit and capital  inc that expired in december we exercised our right under the repurchase agreement to extend the repayment date until june 
table of contents no further advances were permitted under the agreement 
this repurchase agreement bore interest at pricing over libor  varying on the type of asset financed 
this facility was repaid in its entirety in february cdos we completed three separate cdos since by issuing to third party investors  tranches of investment grade collateralized debt obligations through newly formed wholly owned subsidiaries the issuers 
the issuers hold assets  consisting primarily of real estate related assets and cash which serve as collateral for the cdos 
the assets pledged as collateral for the cdos were contributed from our existing portfolio of assets 
by contributing these real estate assets to the various cdos  these transactions resulted in a decreased cost of funds relating to the corresponding cdo assets and created capacity in our existing credit facilities 
the issuers issued tranches of investment grade floating rate notes of approximately million  million and million for cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii  respectively 
cdo iii also has a million revolving note which was not drawn upon at the time of issuance 
the revolving note facility has a commitment fee of per annum on the undrawn portion of the facility 
the tranches were issued with floating rate coupons based on three month libor plus pricing of 
proceeds from the sale of the investment grade tranches issued in cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii of million  million and million  respectively  were used to repay higher costing outstanding debt under our repurchase agreements and notes payable 
the cdos may be replenished with substitute collateral for loans that are repaid during the first four years for cdo i and the first five years for cdo ii and cdo iii  subject to certain customary provisions 
thereafter  the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid 
proceeds from the repayment of assets which serve as collateral for the cdos must be retained in its structure as restricted cash until such collateral can be replaced and therefore not available to fund current cash needs 
if such cash is not used to replenish collateral  it could have a negative impact on our anticipated returns 
proceeds from cdo i and cdo ii are distributed quarterly with approximately million and million  respectively  being paid to investors as a reduction of the cdo liability 
for accounting purposes  cdos are consolidated in our financial statements 
at december   the outstanding note balance under cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii was million  million and million  respectively 
the continued turmoil in the structured finance markets  in particular the sub prime residential loan market  has negatively impacted the credit markets generally  and  as a result  investor demand for commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations has been substantially curtailed 
in recent years  we have relied to a substantial extent on cdo financings to obtain match funded financing for our investments 
until the market for commercial real estate cdos recovers  we may be unable to utilize cdos to finance our investments and we may need to utilize less favorable sources of financing to finance our investments on a long term basis 
there can be no assurance as to when demand for commercial real estate cdos will return or the terms of such securities investors will demand or whether we will be able to issue cdos to finance our investments on terms beneficial to us 
our cdo bonds contain interest coverage and asset over collateralization covenants that must be met in order for us to receive such payments 
if we fail these covenants in any of our cdos  all cash flows from the applicable cdo would be diverted to repay principal and interest on the outstanding cdo bonds and we would not receive any residual payments until that cdo regained compliance with such tests 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  in the event of a breach of the cdo covenants that could not be cured in the near term  we would be required to fund our non cdo expenses  including management fees and employee costs  distributions required to maintain reit status  debt costs  and other expenses with i cash on hand  ii income from any cdo not in breach of a covenant test  iii income from real property and unencumbered loan assets  iv sale of assets  v or accessing the equity or debt capital markets  if available 
we have the ability to cure covenant breaches which would resume normal residual payments to us by purchasing non performing loans out of the cdos 
however  we may not have sufficient liquidity available to do so at such time

the working capital facility  bridge loan warehousing credit agreement  term and revolving credit agreements  and the master repurchase agreements require that we pay interest monthly  based on pricing over libor 
the amount of our pricing over these rates varies depending upon the structure of the loan or investment financed pursuant to the specific agreement 
the working capital facility  term and revolving credit agreements  bridge loan warehousing credit agreement  and the master repurchase agreements require that we pay down borrowings under these facilities pro rata as principal payments on our loans and investments are received 
in addition  if upon maturity of a loan or investment we decide to grant the borrower an extension option  the financial institutions have the option to extend the borrowings or request payment in full on the outstanding borrowings of the loan or investment extended 
the financial institutions also have the right to request immediate payment of any outstanding borrowings on any loan or investment that is at least days delinquent 
cash flow from operations we continually monitor our cash position to determine the best use of funds to both maximize our return on funds and maintain an appropriate level of liquidity 
historically  in order to maximize the return on our funds  cash generated from operations has generally been used to temporarily pay down borrowings under credit facilities whose primary purpose is to fund our new loans and investments 
consequently  when making distributions in the past  we have borrowed the required funds by drawing on credit capacity available under our credit facilities 
however  given current market conditions  we may have to maintain adequate liquidity from operations to make any future distributions 
restrictive covenants each of the credit facilities contains various financial covenants and restrictions  including minimum net worth  minimum liquidity  debt to equity ratios and fixed and senior fixed charge coverage ratios 
in addition to the financial terms and capacities described above  our credit facilities generally contain covenants that prohibit us from effecting a change in control  disposing of or encumbering assets being financed and restrict us from making any material amendment to our underwriting guidelines without approval of the lender 
if we violate these covenants in any of our credit facilities  we could be required to pledge more collateral  or repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms  if at all 
if we are unable to retire our borrowings in such a situation  i we may need to prematurely sell the assets securing such debt  ii the lenders could accelerate the debt and foreclose on the assets that are pledged as collateral to such lenders  iii such lenders could force us into bankruptcy  iv such lenders could force us to take other actions to protect the value of their collateral and v our other debt financings could become 
table of contents immediately due and payable 
any such event would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  the value of our common stock  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and our ability to continue as a going concern 
violations of these covenants may also result in our being unable to borrow unused amounts under our credit facilities  even if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required 
additionally  to the extent that we were to realize additional losses relating to our loans and investments  it would put additional pressure on our ability to continue to meet these covenants 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions for the periods presented with the exception of a minimum liquidity requirement with three financial institutions at december  we are required to have a minimum unrestricted cash and cash equivalents total balance ranging from million to million  depending on the financial institution 
we have obtained waivers of these covenants for december  from all three financial institutions and expect to be in compliance with these covenant calculations or receive the waivers and amendments in future periods

as provided for in the management agreement  acm elected to receive this entire incentive compensation fee in common stock  which was subsequently paid in february in common shares totaling we pay the annual incentive compensation in four installments  each within days of the end of each fiscal quarter 
the calculation of each installment is based on results for the months ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the installment is payable 
these installments of the annual incentive compensation are subject to recalculation and potential reconciliation at the end of such fiscal year 
subject to the ownership limitations in our charter  at least of this incentive compensation is payable to our manager in shares of our common stock having a value equal to the average closing price per share for the last days of the fiscal quarter for which the incentive compensation is being paid 
the incentive compensation is accrued as it is earned 
in accordance with issue b of eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  the expense incurred for incentive compensation paid in common stock is determined using the valuation method described above and the quoted market price of our common stock on the last day of each quarter 
at december of each year  we remeasure the incentive compensation paid to our manager in the form of common stock in accordance with issue a of eitf which discusses how to measure at the measurement date when certain terms are not known prior to the measurement date 
accordingly  the expense recorded for such common stock is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date when the final calculation of the annual incentive compensation is determined 
in the event that the annual incentive compensation calculated as of the measurement date is less than the four quarterly installments of the annual incentive compensation paid in advance  our manager will refund the amount of such overpayment in cash and we would record a negative incentive compensation expense in the quarter when such overpayment is determined 
origination fees 
our manager is entitled to of the origination fees paid by borrowers on all loans and investments that do not exceed of the loan s principal amount 
we retain of the origination fee that exceeds of the loan s principal amount 
term and termination

if we terminate or elect not to renew the management agreement in order to manage our portfolio internally  we are required to pay a termination fee equal to the base management fee and incentive compensation for the month period preceding the termination 
if  without cause  we terminate or elect not to renew the management agreement for any other reason  including a change of control of us  we are required to pay a termination fee equal to two times the base management fee and incentive compensation paid for the month period preceding the termination 
inflation changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest 
however  the significant decline in interest rates during the latter part of and triggered libor floors on certain of our variable rate interest earning assets 
this resulted in an increase in interest rate spreads as the rates we pay on variable rate interest bearing liabilities declined at a greater pace than the rates we earned on our variable rate interest earning assets 
additionally  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
in connection with these loans  
table of contents we have entered into various interest swaps to hedge our exposure to the interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
however  the value of our interest earning assets  our ability to realize gains from the sale of assets  and the average life of our interest earning assets  among other things  may be affected

funds from operations we are presenting funds from operations ffo because we believe it to be an important supplemental measure of our operating performance in that it is frequently used by analysts  investors and other parties in the evaluation of real estate investment trusts reits 
we also use ffo for the calculation of the incentive compensation for our manager  acm 
the revised white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  in april defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of depreciated real properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we consider gains and losses on the sales of real estate investments to be a normal part of our recurring operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be excluded when calculating ffo 
ffo is not intended to be an indication of our cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or a measure of our liquidity  nor is it entirely indicative of funding our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
our calculation of ffo may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and real estate values 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk and interest rate risk 
market conditions we are subject to market changes in the debt and secondary mortgage markets 
these markets are currently experiencing disruptions  which could have a short term adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition 
current conditions in the debt markets include reduced liquidity and increased risk adjusted premiums 
these conditions may increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of debt market disruptions by obtaining adequate debt facilities from a variety of financing sources 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in these efforts  that such debt facilities will be adequate or that the cost of such debt facilities will be at similar terms 
the secondary mortgage markets are also currently experiencing disruptions resulting from reduced investor demand for collateralized debt obligations and increased investor yield requirements for these obligations 
in light of these conditions  we currently expect to finance our loan and investment portfolio with our current capital and debt facilities 
real estate risk commercial mortgage assets may be viewed as exposing an investor to greater risk of loss than residential mortgage assets since such assets are typically secured by larger loans to fewer obligors than residential mortgage assets 
multi family and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  events such as natural disasters including hurricanes and earthquakes  acts of war and or terrorism such as the events of september  and others that may cause unanticipated and uninsured performance declines and or losses to us or the owners and operators of the real estate securing our investment  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  construction delays  construction cost  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty repaying our loans  which could result in losses to us 
in addition  decreases in property values reducing the value of collateral  and a lack of liquidity in the market  could reduce the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
even when the net operating income is sufficient to cover the related property s debt service  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our loans and our borrowing costs 
most of our loans and borrowings are variable rate instruments  based on libor 
the objective of this strategy is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income 
in addition  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio  which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
we have entered into various interest swaps as discussed below to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to our fixed rate loans 
many of our loans and borrowings are subject to various interest rate floors 
as a result  the impact of a change in interest rates may be different on our interest income than it is on our interest expense 
based on our loans  securities held to maturity and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these assets and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in 
table of contents libor would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to various interest rate floors that are in effect at a rate that is above a increase in libor which would limit the effect of a increase  and increased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a increase 
based on the loans and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a decrease in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million

in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in connection with our cdos described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three month libor and one month libor interest rates 
these interest rate swaps became necessary due to the investor s return being paid based on a three month libor index while the assets contributed to the cdos are yielding interest based on a one month libor index 
as of december  and  we had ten of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding that have combined notional values of billion for both periods 
the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december   and december   if there were a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million for both periods 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million for both periods 
in connection with the issuance of variable rate junior subordinate notes  we entered into various interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps have total notional values of million and million  respectively  as of december  and december  the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december  and december   if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that have a combined notional value of million 
as of december  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with combined notional values of million to hedge current and outstanding libor based debt relating to certain fixed rate loans within our portfolio 
the fair market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december  and december   if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps 
table of contents would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
certain of our interest rate swaps  which are designed to hedge interest rate risk associated with a portion of our loans and investments  could require the funding of additional cash collateral for changes in the market value of these swaps 
due to the prolonged volatility in the financial markets that began in  the value of these interest rate swaps have declined substantially 
as a result  at december  and  we funded approximately million and million  respectively  in cash related to these swaps 
if we continue to experience significant changes in the outlook of interest rates  these contracts could continue to decline in value  which would require additional cash to be funded 
however  at maturity the value of these contracts return to par and all cash will be recovered 
if we do not have available cash to meet these requirements  this could result in the early termination of these interest rate swaps  leaving us exposed to interest rate risk associated with these loans and investments  which could adversely impact our financial condition 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements are major financial institutions with high credit ratings with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes
