item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  contained elsewhere herein 
we may seek to obtain this additional capital through  among other things  borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional capital on acceptable terms or at all 
presently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the federal government 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  such events may have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain additional capital 
any inability to obtain additional capital as and when required could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects and results of operations 
we currently have a million credit facility with wachovia bank that expires on april   that provides us with the ability to obtain capital if cash available from other sources is insufficient to meet our needs 
the current global financial crisis could adversely affect our ability to access the funds available under this credit facility 
in the event that we are not able to renew this credit facility or obtain another credit facility  we will not have the ability to make revolving credit borrowings to finance our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
to date  we have not borrowed any funds under this credit facility 
borrowings under our existing credit facility bear interest at variable rates  and borrowings we incur in the future may also bear interest at variable rates  which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates 
in addition  our existing credit facility is secured by an interest in all of our personal property and fixtures  and any debt instruments we enter into in the future may also be secured by our assets  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional debt financing 
we may experience supply interruptions for certain components used in the manufacture and sustainment of our products  which could cause delays in production  product deliveries and the sustainment of our vehicles 
in the event that we are unable to obtain required components from our existing suppliers  and if we are unable to mitigate the impact or find an alternate supplier in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce our vehicles and provide sustainment 
significant interruptions in the supply of components may occur for a variety of reasons  including capacity constraints at our suppliers  competition for components with other manufacturers of vehicles  insolvency of a supplier  work stoppages at suppliers and transportation interruptions  which could involve significant additional costs and result in delays in production  product deliveries and sustainment and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the unavailability or scarcity of certain components or raw material could result in increased costs  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  the economic distress of suppliers  particularly suppliers in the automotive industry  due to the current economic climate may in the future require us to provide financial support or take other measures to ensure our receipt of components or materials 
we may experience commodity cost pressures and the effects of overcapacity in the automobile industry 
these factors have also increased pressure on the industry s supply base  as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs  lower production volumes and other challenges 
as a result  suppliers may be less able to absorb commodity cost increases or to achieve productivity improvements  and  therefore  less willing to reduce prices to us 

table of contents our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we were to lose the services of our key personnel  or if we are unable to recruit qualified managers and key personnel in the future 
moreover  a number of our officers and other key employees have joined our company recently  and therefore have only limited experience with our business 
our success depends on the continued service of our management team and certain key personnel in our engineering department 
if one or more of these individuals were unable to continue working due to health reasons  or were to resign or otherwise terminate their employment with us  we could experience a loss of sales  delays in new product development and diversion of management resources  and we may have difficulty replacing any of these individuals 
we do not have key person insurance on any of our executive employees 
competition for qualified managers and key personnel is intense and we may not be able to recruit and retain such personnel 
if we are unable to retain our existing managers and employees or hire and integrate new personnel  we may experience operating inefficiencies  production delays and reduced profitability or losses 
in addition  a number of our officers and key employees have joined our company recently  and therefore have limited experience with our business  personnel  and administrative systems 
the ability of new management to articulate and implement their strategic vision  and to integrate effectively into our business  personnel  and administrative systems  is critical to our success 
our us government contracts may be terminated or adversely modified prior to completion  which could adversely affect our business 
congress funds the vast majority of the federal budget on an annual basis  and congress often does not provide agencies with all the money requested in their budget 
many of our contracts cover multiple years and  as such  are not fully funded at contract award 
if congress or one of our agency customers chooses to spend money on other programs  our contracts may be terminated 
federal laws  collectively called the anti deficiency act  prohibit involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose  unless otherwise allowed by law 
therefore  the anti deficiency act indirectly regulates how the agencies award our contracts and pays our invoices 
federal government contracts generally contain provisions  and are subject to laws and regulations  that provide the federal government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts  including provisions permitting the federal government to  among other provisions terminate our existing contracts for convenience  unilaterally modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts  subject the award to protest or challenge by competitors  suspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related delivery orders  and claim rights in technologies and systems invented  developed or produced by us 
the federal government may terminate a contract with us either for convenience for instance  due to a change in its perceived needs or if we default due to our failure or the failure of a workshare partner or subcontractor to perform under the contract 
if the federal government terminates a contract with us for convenience  we generally would be entitled to recover only our incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 
however  under certain circumstances  our recovery costs upon termination for convenience of such a contract may be limited 
if the federal government terminates a contract with us based upon our default  we generally would be denied any recovery for undelivered work  and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the federal government in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source 
as is common with government contractors  we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under some of our contracts 
we have in the past received and may in the future receive show cause or cure notices under contracts that  if not addressed to the federal government s 
table of contents satisfaction  could give the government the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts 
us government contracts and subcontracts typically involve long purchase and payment cycles  competitive bidding  qualification requirements  delays or changes in funding  extensive specification development  price negotiations and milestone requirements 
in addition  the proposed transition in the united states to fund military and defense operations from emergency supplemental spending bills to the regular defense budget may have unknown consequences on military spending 
each us government agency often also maintains its own rules and regulations with which we must comply and which can vary significantly among agencies 
our backlog is subject to uncertainties  and we may not sell or receive payment for all of the vehicles we have included in backlog  which would reduce our revenue in future periods 
our backlog reflects the number of vehicles for which we have received orders  but have not yet delivered  as of a specified date 
our backlog is subject to uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that we will deliver or receive payment for the vehicles we have included in our backlog 
as a result  there is no certainty about our future revenues because the timing of any of these vehicles sales and revenues is subject to various contingencies  such as production difficulties  raw material shortages and quality acceptance 
if we fail to sell vehicles included in our backlog  our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we must comply with numerous miscellaneous federal national security laws  regulations  and procedures  as well as the rules and regulations of foreign jurisdictions  and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business 
we must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts that affect how we do business with our clients and impose added costs on our business 
for example  the far and the industrial security regulations of the dod and related laws include provisions that allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership  control or influence  require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information  and require us to comply with laws and regulations intended to promote various social or economic goals 
we are subject to industrial security regulations of the dod and other federal agencies that are designed to safeguard against foreigners access to classified information 
as we expand our operations internationally  we will also become subject to the rules and regulations of foreign jurisdictions 
if we were to come under foreign ownership  control or influence  we could lose our facility security clearances  which could result in our federal government customers terminating or deciding not to renew our contracts  and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 
our failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations or procedures  including federal regulations regarding the protection of classified information  could result in contract termination  loss of security clearances  suspension or prohibition from contracting with the federal government  civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties  any of which would materially adversely affect our business 

table of contents if we do not receive additional orders  we may have excess manufacturing capacity 
if demand for our vehicles declines  we may have additional inefficient or under utilized capacity  and our gross margins and cash flows may suffer and we may incur losses 
in response to the increased demand for our blast and ballistic protected vehicles  we added significant manufacturing capacity during each of the past several years 
demand for our vehicles may not remain at levels sufficient to utilize our present manufacturing capacity 
much of our manufacturing facilities and production equipment are special purpose in nature and cannot be adapted easily to make other products 
if the demand for mine protected vehicles does not increase or declines substantially from current levels  we may have significant under utilized capacity 
therefore  a substantial decline in demand for our blast and ballistic protected vehicles could result in significant additional excess manufacturing capacity  which would adversely affect our results of operations and could result in losses 
we are currently under directives to improve our compliance policies and procedures concerning activity regulated by the international traffic in arms regulations 
in december  we submitted a voluntary disclosure to the ddtc regarding the shipment of technical manuals  cheetah spare parts  armored vest plates  parts not listed on our license and transfers of technical data to and by our vendors without proper authorization or identification of the appropriate exemption 
in january   the ddtc requested additional information and documentation for each specific shipment of these items within sixty days 
in addition  the ddtc directed us to undertake certain specific measures  including  but not limited to  that we hire a full time senior export control compliance officer  implement certain procedures  conduct comprehensive itar training  immediately conduct a comprehensive export compliance audit  and institute a plan to conduct periodic audits of the export compliance program 
on february   we provided ddtc with the job description for the director of export controls  draft export controls manual  itar presentation provided in new orientation training and the attendance logs for annual itar training provided to executives and other employees having itar responsibilities 
on march   we provided ddtc with our draft audit plan and on june   we provided the final audit report 
on july   we provided ddtc with supplemental information to our previous voluntary disclosure and other information identified in the audit 
we have developed and implemented an export control policies and procedures manual and itar product classification guide  established an export control council  and revised our technology control plan and code of conduct and ethics 
as a result of the export compliance audit  we have identified additional unauthorized transfers internally at our facility and in support of us operations in iraq and afghanistan as well as issues associated with the execution of our licenses and agreements 
we have reported these matters to ddtc 
on october   we received a letter from the ddtc advising that  following our voluntary disclosure  this matter has been closed without taking any civil penalties  but reserving the right to reopen if circumstances warrant 
we have also identified additional export compliance matters that may warrant disclosure to ddtc 
although we are in the process of addressing these measures  we cannot assure you that we will be able to correct the weakness in our compliance program 
compliance with the directives of the ddtc may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management 
any failure to adequately address the directives of ddtc could result civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents we are now a large business under applicable us government regulations and may be precluded from being awarded new contracts with the us government unless our accounting and estimating systems are improved sufficiently to meet government standards 
in order to enter into certain contracts with the us military  a contractor s accounting and estimating systems must generally meet the standards established by the far  and  with regard to certain types of contracts  cas 
compliance is usually reviewed by the dcaa  an arm of the dod 
contractors who do not meet these standards generally are not eligible to win certain new contracts from the us government 
because we previously were a small business within the meaning of applicable federal regulations  we were not required to comply with the accounting and estimating requirements in order to enter into contracts with the us military 
however  as a result of the growth of our business  as of november   we are no longer considered a small business and we therefore are required to meet these additional accounting and estimating standards to the extent that they apply to new contracts that we are awarded after november  we have been advised by the dcaa that our accounting and estimating systems do not meet these requirements and  although we have been seeking to improve these systems  we have extensive work remaining in order to meet these standards 
there can be no assurance as to when we will be able to meet these standards and  until we are able to do so  we may not be eligible for new contract awards by the us military 
accordingly  any failure to meet these standards will likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
in that regard  we continue to enhance our accounting system  however  there is some uncertainty as to whether our system will be capable of generating the data necessary to comply with these standards 
if our accounting system is inadequate for these purposes  we could incur substantial delays and additional expenses through efforts to remedy those deficiencies or acquire and implement a new accounting system 
cas requires us to maintain detailed accounting records 
given the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and other deficiencies in our accounting system described below under item a  controls and procedures  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in complying with cas 
cas is designed to achieve uniformity and consistency in the measurement  assignment  and allocation of costs to us government contracts 
cas covered contractors must complete a disclosure statement  which is a written description of the contractor s cost accounting practices and procedures 
the purpose of the disclosure statement is to determine whether the contractor s cost accounting practices and procedures are consistently applied and whether they comply with cas provisions 
if the contractor fails to comply with cas provisions  the us government may withhold up to ten percent of each payment due until the necessary corrections are made 
if a contractor fails to provide accurate information  under certain circumstances  the us government can make unilateral adjustments 
additionally  dcaa may require more frequent updates if audits reveal non compliant cas submissions and accounting 
we submitted a cas disclosure statement to dcaa on may   with an effective date of june  on november   we received an audit report that stated that our submission did not adequately describe our accounting systems 
we are in the process of updating our disclosure statement 
to the extent that cas requirements apply to future contracts awarded to us  we will be required to satisfy more difficult us government accounting requirements than have previously applied  and a failure by us to comply with these new requirements may have consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations  we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions 
we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts 
these laws and regulations affect how we conduct 
table of contents business with our federal government contracts 
in complying with these laws and regulations  we may incur additional costs  and non compliance may also allow for the assignment of additional fines and penalties  including contractual damages 
among the more significant laws and regulations affecting our business are the following the federal acquisition regulation  which comprehensively regulates the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts  the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with certain negotiated contracts  the cost accounting standards and cost principles  which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based federal government contracts  and laws  regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products  services and technical data 
we engage in international work falling under the jurisdiction of us export control laws 
failure to comply with these control regimes can lead to severe penalties  both civil and criminal  and can include debarment from contracting with the us government 
our contracting agency customers periodically review our performance under and compliance with the terms of our federal government contracts  and we may be required to disclose certain types of alleged misconduct with regard to our federal government contracts 
if a government review or investigation or company disclosure results in a finding of improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  cost associated with triggering of price reduction clauses  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
additionally  the civil false claims act provides for potentially substantial civil penalties where  for example  a contractor presents a false or fraudulent claim to the government for payment or approval 
actions under the civil false claims act may be brought by the government or by other persons on behalf of the government who may then share a portion of any recovery 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we may also suffer harm to our reputation  which could impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts 
if we are subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions or suffer harm to our reputation  our current business  future prospects  financial condition  or operating results could be materially harmed 
the government may also revise its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations  including cost accounting standards  at any time 
any new contracting methods could be costly to satisfy  administratively difficult for us to implement and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 

table of contents we are presently subject to a number of legal proceedings and claims and we may become subject to additional legal proceedings and claims in the future 
we have been named in several purported class actions brought by shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired our securities between and  alleging violations of the exchange act  and making false and misleading public statements and or omissions 
other shareholders have named us and certain current and former officers and directors in derivative suits alleging breaches of fiduciary duties 
we have also been subject to a variety of other lawsuits  including claims involving the use of our confidential information and trade secrets  equal employment opportunity commission claims  contractual claims  claims related to our common shares  osha claims and claims by the department of state  directorate of defense trade controls ddtc 
litigation and regulatory inquiries of these types are often expensive and time consuming and their outcome is uncertain 
such claims and regulatory inquiries  whether successful or not  could require us to devote significant amounts of monetary or human resources to defend ourselves and could harm our reputation 
we may need to spend significant amounts on our legal defense  senior management may be required to divert their attention from other portions of our business  new product launches may be deferred or canceled as a result of any proceedings  and we may be required to make changes to our present and planned products or services 
if  as a result of any proceedings  a settlement is reached  a judgment is rendered or a decree is entered against us  it could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation 
we are also a party to other litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business 
we may be involved from time to time in other litigation that could have a material effect on our operations or finances 
other than the litigation described above  we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
see item  legal proceedings in part i of this annual report on form k 
we may not be able to adequately safeguard our intellectual property rights and trade secrets from unauthorized use  and we may become subject to claims that we infringe on others intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  trademarks  and other intellectual property laws  licensing agreements  nondisclosure agreements with employees and customers and other protective measures to preserve our proprietary rights to our products and production processes 
our pending patent applications may not be granted by the various patent offices examining them 
even if our patent applications are granted and issued as patents  these measures afford only limited protection and may not preclude competitors from developing products or processes similar or superior to ours 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
although we implement protective measures and intend to defend our proprietary rights  these efforts may not be successful 
from time to time  we may litigate within the united states or abroad to enforce our issued or licensed patents  to protect our trade secrets and know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of others 
for example  we were recently engaged in a lawsuit in which we alleged misappropriation of our intellectual property 
see item  legal proceedings 
enforcing or defending our proprietary rights could be expensive  requires management s attention and might not bring us timely or effective relief 
we are party to two long term intellectual property agreements pursuant to which we have the exclusive right to use certain intellectual property technology relating to blast and ballistic protected vehicles through and  respectively 
see item  business intellectual property for a further 
table of contents discussion of these agreements with csir and mechem 
in the event that the license agreements expire without renewal  csir and mechem may permit other parties to use the licensed technology  including our competitors 
the loss of these intellectual property rights may adversely affect our operations 
furthermore  third parties may assert that our products or processes infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
infringement claims against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources even if we ultimately prevail 
a third party claiming infringement may also obtain an injunction or other equitable relief  which could effectively block the distribution or sale of allegedly infringing products 
although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing  we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
our products are subject to export limitations and we may be prevented from shipping our products to certain nations or buyers 
we are subject to federal licensing requirements with respect to the sale and support in foreign countries of certain of our products and the importation of components for our products 
in addition  we are obligated to comply with a variety of federal  state and local regulations  both domestically and abroad  governing certain aspects of our international sales and support  including regulations promulgated by  among others  the us departments of commerce  defense and state and the us department of justice  bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives 
such licenses may be denied for reasons of us national security or foreign policy 
in the case of certain large orders for exports of defense equipment  the department of state must notify congress at least to days  depending on the size and location of the sale  prior to authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to foreign governments 
during that time  congress may take action to block the proposed sale 
we can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that congress will not prevent or delay certain sales 
any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the us could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
for products and technology exported from the us or otherwise subject to us jurisdiction  we are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports  including  but not limited to itar  ear  or fms  program and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by ofac  us department of the treasury 
we have discovered shortcomings in our export compliance procedures 
we are currently analyzing product shipments and technology transfers  working with us government officials to ensure compliance with applicable us export laws and regulations  and enhancing our export compliance system 
we have made voluntary disclosures to the department of state and provided additional documentation to the us department of state regarding compliance issues 
the state department personnel visited our facilities in december as part of the state department company visit program for a further review of our export control policies and procedures  as well as their implementation 
the voluntary disclosures that have been finally adjudicated by the us department of state did not result in any monetary fines or restrictions on exports 
the us department of state recommended enhancements to our compliance program  some of which we have implemented and others which we are implementing 
we are currently reviewing additional compliance information and will file voluntary disclosures if warranted 
a determination by the us government that we have failed to comply with one or more of these export controls or trade sanctions  as a consequence of the results of the directed disclosure or any other violations that may be determined  could result in civil or criminal penalties  including the imposition of significant fines  denial of export privileges  loss of revenues from certain customers  and debarment from participation in us government contracts 
any one or more of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to the fcpa and other laws which prohibit improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by us and other business entities 
we operate in countries known to experience corruption 
our operations in such countries create the risk of an unauthorized payment by one of our employees or agents which would be in violation of various laws including the fcpa 
violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in that regard  we do not have a formal fcpa compliance program 
additionally  the failure to obtain applicable governmental approval and clearances could materially adversely affect our ability to continue to service the government contracts we maintain 
exports of some of our products to certain international destinations may require shipment authorization from us export control authorities  including the us departments of commerce and state  and authorizations may be conditioned on end use restrictions 
failure to receive these authorizations may materially adversely affect our revenues and in turn our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
our international business may pose greater risks than our domestic business due to the greater potential for changes in foreign economic and political environments 
our international business is also highly sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets 
sales of military products are affected by defense budgets both in the us and abroad and us foreign policy 
sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to import export control 
risks related to our common stock our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock 
under the terms of our articles of incorporation  our board of directors is authorized to issue from time to time  without any need for approval by our shareholders but subject to any limitations prescribed by law  shares of our preferred stock in one or more series 
each series shall consist of such number of shares and have the rights  preferences  powers and restrictions  such as dividend rights and preferences  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption and liquidation rights and preferences  as our board of directors shall determine 
such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights 
the board of directors may issue preferred stock with voting  conversion or other rights that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company and that could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
our stock price has been volatile  and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline 
the market price and trading volume of our common stock has been subject to significant volatility  and this trend may continue 
for example  in the last quarter of fiscal year  the price of our common stock ranged from to 
the value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance or prospects 
factors affecting our market price include  but are not limited to  our failure to meet expectations regarding new orders or sales of our vehicles  differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts  announcements of new contracts or orders by us or our competitors  and market reaction to any future acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors 
recent events have caused stock prices for many companies  including ours  to fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance 
the general economic  political and stock market conditions that may affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control 
the 
table of contents continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial markets has had and may continue to have an impact on our stock price 
the market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
any such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and by laws  as well as nevada corporation law  could make it difficult for our shareholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as discussed above  our board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock in one or more series without shareholder approval 
any issuance of this blank check preferred stock could materially limit the rights of holders of the common stock and render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
in addition  our articles of incorporation and by laws contain a number of provisions that could impede a takeover or change in control of us  including our staggered board  limitation on the ability of our shareholders to act by written consent  advance notice provisions and the ability for the board of directors to fill a vacancy on our board of directors 
certain provisions of the nevada general corporation law could also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board of directors or shareholders 
these provisions relate to  among other things  the acquisition of a controlling interest in a nevada corporation meeting certain requirements or certain business combinations and other transactions between a nevada corporation and certain interested stockholders

highlights and executive summary we are in the business of providing survivability solutions to support armed forces and security personnel in harm s way 
we design  manufacture  test  deliver and support our blast and ballistic protected products to increase survivability of the users of our products 
our specialty vehicles  which we believe are at the forefront of blast and ballistic protected technology  are designed to protect their 
table of contents occupants from landmines  hostile fire  and improvised explosive devices ieds 
in addition  we develop  manufacture  test  deliver and support products aimed at further enhancing the survivability of vehicles against additional threats 
our patented forcearmor is designed to provide protection against explosively formed projectiles efps 
we are a key provider of the us military s mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicle program and have sold over  vehicles under this program 
we also provide our cougar mastiff  cougar ridgback  cougar wolfhound  and buffalo mine protected vehicles to the united kingdom ministry of defence 
during the period january   through december   we received orders for vehicles 
during this same period we delivered  vehicles under the mrap and other blast and ballistic protected vehicle programs  including vehicles manufactured pursuant to the terms of our arrangement with general dynamics land systems inc gdls described further in item  business  major contracts under mrap competitive contract 
during the period january  through december   we also delivered eight forcearmor kits  as well as million in spare parts and million in mechanical field services 
during the period january  through december   we delivered  vehicles under blast and ballistic protected vehicle programs 
through an acquisition in  we began shifting our principal focus from our then existing recreational watercraft production business to the production of mine clearing and armored vehicles 
our business began to grow exponentially when we were awarded contracts by the us military in and each year after that 
by  substantially all of our net sales were derived from work performed directly or indirectly under us government contracts 
for the years ended december   and  our net sales totaled billion  million  and million  respectively  and our net income totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
overview all of our products are aimed at offering improved protection to personnel operating in areas posing threats of blast or ballistic attack 
since the early stages of operation iraqi and operation enduring freedom  the us military has sought a wheeled vehicle approach that balances three potentially competing operational or mission dynamics i protection  which refers to the level of crew survivability against blast and ballistic attack  ii payload  which refers to the load that the vehicles can carry on board the platform  measured in units  such as crew members and cargo  and iii performance  which refers to a vehicle s automotive mobility  its ability to provide technological solutions to mission requirements  and its suitability for transportation in existing military aircraft and ships 
we currently offer the following vehicle types aimed at fulfilling different operational or mission requirements the buffalo platform  the cougar platform  and the cheetah platform 
we also currently offer forcearmor as an external bolt on solution  which provides state of the art protection against attack by efps 
forcearmor is designed of commercially available materials that  when combined and packaged into a kit  offer lightweight bolt on solutions that can be tailored to bolt on to the outside of any military vehicle platform 
it is a modular solution that enables unit commanders to rapidly install or remove the kit depending on the threat they face 
we also offer products and solutions which are aimed at enhancing the survivability of vehicles against further attacks  such as our life cycle support and forcearmor 

table of contents we are headquartered  and have manufacturing facilities  in ladson  south carolina 
in march  we purchased a blast range in edgefield  south carolina  and leased a related office building 
we use these facilities for our own research and development activities and may also contract with selected governmental and commercial customers to use our facilities 
we also purchased  in march  a facility in summerville  south carolina  for the intended purpose of expanding research and development operations and to facilitate our increased customer training requirements of products and applications 
in july  we purchased an additional facility in roxboro  north carolina 
we intend to use this facility for training and sustainment purposes 
in january  we leased a small furnished office space in sterling heights  michigan  for use as an offsite engineering office 
our business business model and key concepts our business is heavily influenced by the needs of the us military for blast and ballistic protected wheeled vehicles 
the dod is our largest customer 
for the past several years  substantially all of our net sales have been derived from the us government 
we align our workforce to satisfy our business requirements 
key challenges our rapid growth has come with numerous challenges 
coupled with our reliance on the us military for substantially all of our business  we have identified the following key challenges to continued success continuing to capture contract awards for our products and services in a volatile marketplace  competing for life cycle logistics support for our fielded fleet of vehicles  establishing long term programs to include upgrades  remanufacture  and sustainment for our fleet of vehicles  continuing the expansion of our customer base both domestically and internationally  continuing the development of new products to bring to market  and eliminating or reducing internal control weaknesses over financial reporting and disclosure 
as discussed in item a  risk factors  the main uncertainty about our future operations is whether we will continue to receive additional orders or contracts for our vehicles or our survivability solutions 
we have no further substantial mrap vehicle orders to fulfill at this time 
orders for our cougar variant vehicles will allow us to continue production through the second quarter of and for our buffalo vehicles to extend production until the fourth quarter of it is impossible to predict with certainty whether such future orders or contracts will be placed by existing or new customers 
if we do not receive future orders or contracts for production beyond such dates  it is unlikely that our vehicle business will continue and our business will be materially affected 
as discussed in item a  risk factors  substantially all of our income comes from our us government contracts either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor to another prime contractor to the us government 
we received and fulfilled substantial vehicle orders from the us military under the mrap program  which accounted for substantially all of the increase in our net sales during the year ended december  these orders have resulted  in significant part  from the particular combat situations encountered by the us military in iraq and afghanistan  especially the use of ieds by enemy combatants 
we cannot be certain  therefore  to what degree the us military will continue placing orders  and these orders may decrease significantly or cease 
the loss or significant reduction in 
table of contents government funding of a large program in which we participate could also result in a material decrease to our future sales  earnings and cash flows 
as discussed in item a  risk factors  we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have concluded that our disclosure controls were not effective as of december   and although we have taken steps to correct our material weaknesses  we may still be subject to risks 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan  or fail to update our internal control over financial reporting as our business evolves  we may be unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective internal controls and procedures 
there can be no assurance that  as a result of these remediation efforts or otherwise  we will not identify other inaccuracies in either our previous or future financial statements that will require amendments and restatements to those financial statements  which could have a material adverse effect on us and the price of our common stock 
during  we sought to stabilize our business to match our contract delivery order requirements 
we recognized that our business was changing  and in response  we are attempting to rebalance our workforce and manufacturing capacity 
we may incur costs as a result of our efforts to recalibrate our business to meet the needs of our customers 
in addition  in the past three years we had sought to rapidly expand and develop our operations and production capacity 
we have incurred costs and are continuing to incur significant costs associated with our rapid expansion based on the expectation of future contract revenues 
we are still experiencing and may continue to experience certain effects from this rapid growth  such as payments under severance arrangements and the costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity and inventory 
this growth had placed significant demands on our management and our administrative  operating  manufacturing and financial resources 
in addition  our accounting and financial systems need to be substantially improved in order to accommodate our current and projected production levels and to support our government compliance requirements now that we are classified as a large business under applicable federal contracting regulations 
we continue to face challenges in improving our administrative  operating  managerial  accounting and financial systems to accommodate our current and projected production levels 
strategy and key trends strategy our business strategy is built around three main imperatives first  constant focus on innovation and the introduction of new survivability products and solutions  second  expand our customer base  and third  procure contracts for sustainment services of our fleet of vehicles across all customers 
specific components of the strategy  discussed in greater detail in item  business  include the following identify new products and markets to meet evolving customer requirements  capitalize on demand for blast and ballistic protected vehicles and other survivability solutions  expand our total life cycle support footprint  focus on core competencies  leverage key relationships to grow our business  and develop and expand strategic partnerships 

table of contents key trends for periods subsequent to  certain factors are expected to affect our results of operations as compared to results reported herein for through some of these factors are likely reduction of combat forces using our vehicles in iraq will reduce the operational tempo placed on our fleet  an increase in forces deploying to afghanistan will necessitate changes to the vehicles and increased sustainment maintenance requirements  declining defense budgets may have an impact on planned future defense procurement needs  and our current customers establishing long term plans and visibility for their fleets of our vehicles 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated statements of operations  which reflect our results of operations for the years ended december   and  as prepared in accordance with gaap

as a result  we have reclassified 
table of contents million from cougar all variants to spare parts  upgrades and services revenue for the year ended december  additionally  we have reclassified million and  for the three months ended march  and june   respectively 
the reclassifications are reflected in the amounts reported here for the year ended december  cost of sales and gross profit for the year ended december  in thousands cost of sales gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales the gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by percentage points for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of several factors cost savings resulting from increased material and labor efficiencies  increased higher profit margin sales of spare parts and training services versus vehicle sales  million lower write down of our raw material and supplies to their net realizable values in  net of items used in production of million of parts that had been previously written down  and million lower losses on purchase commitments 
these increases were partially offset by increased gdls subcontract activity  whereby we recognized minimal gross profit in and no gross profit in on vehicles produced by gdls 
the revenue on vehicles produced by gdls totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  demand for our blast and ballistic protected vehicles was substantially unchanged during we produced and shipped  vehicles excluding those produced by gdls in versus  vehicles excluding those produced by gdls in  or an increase of 
the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increased use of outside services in to restate each of the interim periods of  related litigation and other litigation  costs related to excess capacity and impairment of certain roxboro  north carolina facility assets  the costs of right sizing of our workforce by over full time equivalent positions to more closely align with current and anticipated reduced future business levels  implementation of a short term incentive compensation plan for executives  and a one time contribution to the medical university of south carolina foundation for brain trauma research 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of a liquidated damage charge incurred during the year ended december  related to our december private investment in public entity pipe 
table of contents stock offering because the registration statement for the pipe shares was not declared effective within the required time frame 
significant year over year cost increases included legal fees million  impairment charges million  consulting fees million  audit fees million  gain share and short term incentive compensation million  severance expenses million  and charitable contributions million

research and development expenses for the year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales research and development expense increased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in prototype build activity 
during  we introduced force armor  developed and finished a protoype of the tactical support vehicle and developed the cheetah m atv 
other income other income decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  primarily due to decreased levels of average funds available for investing and lower rates of return

we also incurred a write down of our raw material and supplies to their net realizable values in the amount of million  and we incurred a loss of million on firm commitments to acquire raw materials and supplies 
see note  inventories  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the remainder of the decrease was primarily due to operational inefficiencies  and the use of contract labor in the production process 
we define the gross profit percentage as net sales less cost of sales divided by net sales 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december   or an increase of 
demand for our blast and ballistic protected vehicles increased substantially during  especially for the mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicles  in response to the pervasive threat confronting our troops in iraq and afghanistan from land mines  hostile fire  and improvised explosive devices ieds 
we expanded our operations such that we were able to produce and ship  vehicles in versus only vehicles in  or an increase of 
the increase in expense was primarily due to our increased general and administrative functions required to support the increased vehicle production activities associated with the mrap program and the rapidly expanding customer base 
prior to  we did not have the operational or administrative infrastructure in place to accommodate this accelerated level of production volume 
establishing this infrastructure resulted in a sizeable increase in general and administrative costs  especially since it was accomplished in such a

other income other income increased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  primarily due to the interest income earned on investment of the funds received from our december private placement of common stock 
interest expense interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  primarily due to the repayment of a short term loan in august and the termination of an accounts receivable factoring agreement in june facilitated by the sale of common stock through private placements  partially offset by the bank fees associated with the line of credit 
income tax expense benefit we incurred income tax expense for the year ended december  as a result of the increase in our net sales and profitability compared to the year ended december  the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was 
see note  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as of december   the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million was eliminated as we expect to realize future earnings sufficient to fully utilize the accumulated income tax benefit 

table of contents series d convertible preferred stock dividends and accretion there are no preferred stock dividends or accretion of preferred stock in as all preferred stock was converted to common stock by year end net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  decreased over the comparable period in primarily due to decreased gross margins and increased selling  administrative  development  research  and income tax expenses partially offset by increased interest income and decreased preferred stock dividends and accretion 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by operating  financing and investing activities 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash from operations  primarily from the us government 
sources and uses of cash our primary sources of funding are cash flows from operations and from financing activities 
over the past three years  our funds were used primarily to fund working capital requirements and to make capital expenditures 
the following chart shows the cash flows provided by or used in operating  investing  and financing activities for   and in thousands for the year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  an increase from million at the end of and a decrease from million at the end of cash flow from operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased by million during the year ended december  compared to this change was primarily due to an increase in net income partially offset by an increase in working capital 
working capital excluding cash increased million over the prior year 
changes in working capital excluding cash in included an increase in accounts receivable of million resulting primarily from a change in sales mix a higher portion of vehicles sold in the fourth quarter of did not have advance payments  
table of contents a decrease in inventories of million resulting primarily from a reduction in the purchase of raw material and supplies related to the mrap program as its production cycle nears its end  and the write down of obsolete inventory  a decrease in accounts payable of million  reflecting an increase in payments to suppliers and a reduction in inventory purchases  a decrease in advance payment on contracts of million  offset by a decrease in advances to subcontractor of million  resulting from a reduction in the number of vehicles under contract for which we receive and make advance payments  an increase in the amount due to the us government of million  primarily due to an increased definitization reserve requirement for vehicles sold under the fms contracts  and a decrease of million in the other components of working capital 
the majority of our cash receipts are from the us government and other foreign governments  and therefore the risk of default on payment of our accounts receivable as of december  is very low 
however  the deepening global credit crisis and recession in the united states and western europe may have an impact on the us and other governments to continue to fund defense contracts and programs or delay payments to its contractors in the future 
cash used in operating activities decreased by million during the year ended december  compared with this change was primarily due to an increase in advance payments on contracts partially offset by an increase in working capital and a decrease in deferred income taxes 
our advance payments on contracts increased due to the receipt of performance based payments on the mrap program 
working capital usage increased million accounts receivable  inventories  and accounts payable to support increased sale volumes 
deferred income taxes decreased due to the elimination of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million as of december  cash flow from investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased by million during compared with during  we expended approximately million primarily to complete the expansion of our manufacturing capability and capacity that we began in and to upgrade our information technology infrastructure 
the majority of those expenditures were made in the first three months of we anticipate that capital expenditures for will total approximately million 
as our business grew  we made several significant acquisitions and expanded our manufacturing capacity and infrastructure 
in march  we purchased the research and developmental testing facility of newtec services group  inc  located near edgefield  south carolina  for million  million of which was in cash 
in march  we purchased real and personal property located in summerville  south carolina  for million in cash to use as a product development and logistic services training center 
in july  we purchased land and an approximately  square foot building in roxboro  north carolina  for million that we intend to use for training and sustainment purposes 
also  in july  we completed construction on and placed into service a  square foot warehouse facility at our corporate headquarters in ladson  south carolina  at a cost of approximately million in cash 
during  we began to construct additional assembly lines 
construction in progress for the year ended december  totaled million 
additionally  we made leasehold improvements totaling million and purchased computer equipment and software totaling million 
during  we acquired a paint booth  overhead cranes and welding equipment to expand our manufacturing capacity 
we also acquired computers  furniture and a more robust accounting system to support our business growth 

table of contents cash flow from financing activities during the years ended december  and  we did not issue common stock except for exercised employee options and vested restricted stock or debt to fund business activities 
during the year ended december   we issued common stock for two private placements in public equity and exercised common stock warrants  totaling million to fund the expansion of the business and retired million of short term debt 
see note  shareholders equity  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
current liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents as of december  were held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in short term united states treasury bills and money market funds 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
during  we expended approximately million to complete the expansion of our manufacturing capability and capacity and to upgrade our information technology infrastructure 
we do not expect any major capital expenditures in the amount of capital that we will require depends on several factors  including without limitation  the extent and timing of sales of our products  performance based payments  inventory costs  costs of raw materials and components  labor costs  costs of improving our financial and accounting systems  the timing and costs associated with the expansion of our manufacturing  development  engineering and customer support capabilities  the timing and cost of our product development and enhancement activities and our operating results 
we currently estimate that the cash flow we anticipate will be generated by our business will be sufficient to meet our presently budgeted capital expenditures and our other presently anticipated cash needs for the year ending december  in addition  we have available to us a million line of credit  which expires on april  after that time  we expect that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital  which may include borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities  including common stock  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us when we need it or  if available  that the terms of any such financing will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our shareholders 
any failure to obtain necessary capital as and when required could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity  or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services with the registrant 
the following discussion addresses each of the above items for the company 
as of december   we do not have any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts as defined above

as of december   we do not hold derivative financial instruments  as defined by fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
as of december   we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  and  we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
contractual obligations achieving optimal returns on cash often involves making long term commitments 
sec regulations require that we present our contractual obligations  and we have done so in the table that follows 
however  our future cash flow prospects cannot reasonably be assessed based on such obligations  as the most significant factor affecting our future cash flows is our ability to earn and collect cash from our customers 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  will vary based on our future needs 
while some such outflows are completely fixed for example  commitments to repay principal and interest on fixed rate borrowings  most will depend on future events for example  payments to subcontractors under long term contracts 
further  normal operations involve significant expenditures that are not based on commitments for example  amounts paid for income taxes or for payroll 
our consolidated contractual obligations as of december   are as follows in thousands total and thereafter operating lease obligations a b d purchase obligations b c d other long term liabilities d e total a we lease most of our facilities as well as other property and equipment under operating leases in the normal course of business 
some of our facility leases contain escalation clauses 
the minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
b future operating lease obligations and purchase obligations are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on force protection and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
d because our future cash outflows are uncertain  the following liabilities are excluded from the table above workers compensation risks  deferred income taxes  warranty reserve  and our estimated 
table of contents liability for unsettled litigation 
for more information  see note  income taxes  and note  contingencies and other commitments  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
e includes accreted interest at for the non compete agreement portion 
dividends we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain earnings  if any  to finance the growth and development of our business  and we do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
payment of future dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  restrictions contained in current or future financing instruments  and other factors the board deems relevant 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but are not limited to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  definitization and advance payments on contracts  inventory costs and reserves  asset impairments depreciable lives of assets  economic lives and fair value of leased assets  income tax reserves and valuation allowances  fair value of stock options  allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales  and litigation reserves 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  and accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations 
actual results could differ from the estimates we have used 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value and net of the cost of excess and obsolete items 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory for which the resale value or replacement value is less than the inventoriable cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include whether individual inventory parts meet current specifications and can be substituted for a part currently being sold or used as a service part  overall market conditions  and other inventory management initiatives 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventories 
in the future  if our inventories are determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventories are determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of sales in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities 
they are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  we establish reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine if  and the extent to which  valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
since december   we have not had a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset 
contingent tax liabilities are based on our assessment of the likelihood that we have incurred a liability 
such liabilities are reviewed based on recent changes in tax laws and regulations  including judicial rulings 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions assessment of loss contingencies we have legal and other contingencies  including product warranties  which could result in significant losses upon the ultimate resolution of such contingencies 
we have provided for losses in situations where we have concluded that it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable due to the uncertainty involved in determining the likelihood of future events and estimating the financial statement impact of such events 
if further developments or resolution of a contingent matter are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period related to an existing contingency 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
fasb statement no 
defines the order in which accounting principles that are generally accepted should be followed 
fasb statement no 
became effective november  we follow the hierarchy and therefore expect that the adoption of fasb statement no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued staff position fsp no

fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp fas also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we expect that the adoption of fsp fas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fasb statement no 
changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  ii how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related interpretations  and iii how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
fasb statement no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application permitted 
fasb statement no 
permits  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
we do not have financial instruments subject to fasb statement no 
 and  as a result  the adoption of fasb statement no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities 

table of contents in september  fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  which clarifies the definition of fair value whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
specifically  the standard clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability  and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
fasb statement no 
does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances  and must be applied on a prospective basis except in certain cases 
the standard also requires expanded financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements  including disclosure of the methods used and the effect on earnings 
in february  fasb staff position fsp fas no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 was issued 
fsp no 
defers the effective date of fasb statement no 
to fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
examples of items within the scope of fsp no 
are nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination but not measured at fair value in subsequent periods  and long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets measured at fair value for an impairment assessment under fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the partial adoption of fasb statement no 
on january   with respect to financial assets and financial liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are in the process of analyzing the potential impact of fasb statement no 
relating to our january  adoption of the remainder of the standard 
on january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
fasb statement no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  which are not otherwise currently required to be measured at fair value 
under fasb statement no 
 the decision to measure items at fair value is made at specified election dates on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
entities electing the fair value option are required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings and to expense upfront costs and fees associated with the item for which the fair value option is elected 
the new standard did not impact our consolidated financial statements as we did not elect the fair value option for any instruments existing as of the adoption date 
however  we currently plan to evaluate the fair value measurement election with respect to financial instruments we enter into in the future 
we have determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  or do not apply to our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
if the price of steel increases significantly  the cost of our products could increase 
it is unlikely we will be able to pass on this cost under our current contracts 
as a result  if the cost of our raw material increases  our profitability  if any  could decrease 

table of contents foreign currency the majority of our business is denominated in us dollars and as such  movement in the foreign currency markets will have a minimal direct impact on our business 
interest rates we do not have a trading portfolio and although our current financing arrangement is at a variable rate  we do not have any borrowings under the arrangement 
as a result  we are not currently directly at risk of interest rate fluctuations 
as our financing needs change in the future  interest rate risk may become a more significant issue for us 
currently  we do not use any derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange  or commodity prices 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives nor do we hold or issue financial investments for speculative purposes
