item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes thereto 
this report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following the planned opening of new american eagle stores and new aerie stores in the united states and canada during fiscal  the selection of to american eagle stores in the united states and canada for remodeling during fiscal  the future opening of kids by american eagle stores  the success of martin osa and martinandosa 
com  the success of aerie by american eagle and aerie 
com  the expected payment of a dividend in future periods  the possibility of growth through acquisitions and or internally developing additional new brands  the possibility that we may be required to take additional temporary or other than temporary impairment otti charges relating to our investment securities  the possibility that the amounts drawn on our demand borrowing agreements will be called for repayment and that the facilities may not be available for future borrowings  and the possibility that we may be required to take additional store impairment charges related to underperforming stores 
we caution that these forward looking statements  and those described elsewhere in this report  involve material risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on factors beyond our control  as discussed within part i  item a of this form k 
accordingly  our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statement 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ from these estimates 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believe them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue for store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
our e commerce operation records revenue upon the estimated customer receipt date of the merchandise 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase  and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions 
the estimated sales return reserve is based on projected merchandise returns determined through the use of historical average return percentages 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents during fiscal  we discontinued assessing a service fee on inactive gift cards 
as a result  we estimate gift card breakage and recognize revenue in proportion to actual gift card redemptions as a component of net sales 
we determine an estimated gift card breakage rate by continuously evaluating historical redemption data and the time when there is a remote likelihood that a gift card will be redeemed 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
we review our inventory in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear merchandise 
additionally  we estimate a markdown reserve for future planned markdowns related to current inventory 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns may have a material adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
we estimate an inventory shrinkage reserve for anticipated losses for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve is calculated based on historical percentages and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory shrinkage reserve 
however  if actual physical inventory losses differ significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
asset impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  over its remaining useful life  to the carrying value 
if the future cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the asset value to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
investment securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas no 
 we measure our investment securities using level  level and level inputs 
level and level inputs are valued using quoted market prices while we use a discounted cash flow dcf model to determine the fair value of our level investments 
the assumptions in our model include different recovery periods depending on the type of security and varying discount factors for yield and illiquidity 
these assumptions are subjective 
they are based on our current judgment and our view of current market conditions 
the use of different assumptions would result in a different valuation and related charge 
future adverse changes in market conditions  continued poor operating results of underlying investments or other factors could result in further losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an additional impairment charge in the future 
any otti charge could materially affect our results of operations 
we evaluate our investments for impairment in accordance with fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas 
fsp fas provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
we record an other than temporary investment impairment charge at the point we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred  we review information about the underlying investment that is publicly available  analyst reports  applicable industry data and other pertinent information  and assess our ability and intent to hold the securities for the foreseeable future 
the investment is written down to its current fair 
table of contents value at the time the impairment is deemed to have occurred 
future adverse changes in market conditions  continued poor operating results of underlying investments or other factors could result in further losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an additional impairment charge in the future 
if  after consideration of all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investment  impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the investment s carrying value and its fair value 
share based payments 
we account for share based payments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term and the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term 
we calculate a weighted average expected term based on historical experience 
expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility 
we chose to use a combination of historical and implied volatility as we believe that this combination is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
effective february   we adopted financial accounting standards board the fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
under fin  a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of fin we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as computed pursuant to fin deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates  based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance  in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
changes in our level and composition of earnings  tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as the results of tax audits may materially impact our effective tax rate 
the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position and to establish a valuation allowance require management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities  valuation allowances  or net income 
key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which are considered key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one year over the comparable prior year period 
in fiscal years following those with weeks  including fiscal  the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks 
a store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation 
however  stores that have a gross square footage increase of or greater due to a remodel are removed from the comparable store sales base  but are included in total sales 
these stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the remodel 
sales from aeo direct are not included in comparable store sales 

table of contents our management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies  rent  etc 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs  as well as markdowns  shrinkage  certain promotional costs and buying  occupancy and warehousing costs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing costs consist of compensation  employee benefit expenses and travel for our buyers  rent and utilities related to our stores  corporate headquarters  distribution centers and other office space  freight from our distribution centers to the stores  compensation and supplies for our distribution centers  including purchasing  receiving and inspection costs  and shipping and handling costs related to our e commerce operation 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating income our management views operating income as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross profit  our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses  and our level of capital expenditures 
store productivity store productivity  including net sales per average square foot  sales per productive hour  average unit retail price  conversion rate  the number of transactions per store  the number of units sold per store and the number of units per transaction  is evaluated by our management in assessing our operational performance 
inventory turnover our management evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is bought and sold 
inventory turnover is important as it can signal slow moving inventory 
this can be critical in determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise 
cash flow and liquidity our management evaluates cash flow from operations  investing and financing in determining the sufficiency of our cash position 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to cover our uses of cash 
our management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
results of operations overview in fiscal  the company s financial performance did not meet management s expectations 
we faced an increasingly challenging consumer environment  which impacted store traffic and transaction volume and had a particularly negative impact on the fourth quarter results 
the challenging fourth quarter led to an overall decrease in fiscal annual sales and net earnings compared to fiscal in addition to this  we experienced slow demand in ae brand women s merchandise  which is our highest volume division 
net sales decreased to billion from billion in the prior year 
annual comparable store sales declined 
a slowdown in consumer demand resulted in significantly higher promotional activity  leading to a decline in gross profit 
negative comparable stores sales also impacted fixed expenses 
rent increased to from as a percent to net sales while total selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to from as a rate to net sales 
operating income as a percent to net sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal  net income decreased to million 
as a percent to net sales  net income decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal net income per diluted share decreased to from last year 
we ended fiscal with million in cash  short term and long term investments  a decrease of million from last year 
during the year  we continued to make investments in our business  including 
table of contents million in capital expenditures 
these expenditures related primarily to our new and remodeled stores in the us and canada  as well as headquarters  point of sale and distribution center projects 
the following table shows  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship to net sales of the listed items included in our consolidated statements of operations 
for the fiscal years ended january  february  february  net sales cost of sales  including certain buying  occupancy and warehousing expenses gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expense operating income other income  net other than temporary impairment charge income before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations our operations are conducted in one reportable segment  which includes our us and canadian ae retail stores  aerie by american eagle retail stores  martin osa retail stores and aeo direct 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales net sales decreased to billion from billion 
the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in comparable store sales despite an increase in sales from our e commerce operation and an increase in gross square feet due to new and remodeled stores 
during fiscal  our ae brand average transaction value was flat compared to fiscal this was driven by a mid single digit increase in units per transaction offset by a mid single digit decline in average unit retail price 
comparable store sales were essentially flat in the ae brand men s business and declined in the high teens in the ae brand women s business compared to fiscal gross profit gross profit decreased to billion from billion in fiscal gross margin as a percent to net sales decreased by basis points to from last year 
the percentage decrease was attributed to a basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate and a basis point increase in buying  occupancy and warehousing costs as a percent to net sales 
merchandise margin decreased for the period due primarily to increased markdowns as well as an increase in merchandise costs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing expenses increased basis points as a percent to net sales 
this was primarily due to a basis point increase in rent as a percent to net sales  driven by new store openings and the negative comparable store sales  as well as higher utilities 
these increases were partially offset by lower distribution and warehousing service costs due to bringing our aeo direct fulfillment and canadian distribution services in house 
share based payment expense included in gross profit decreased to approximately million compared to million last year 
our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other retailers  as some retailers include all costs related to their distribution network  as well as design costs in cost of sales 
other retailers may exclude a portion of these 
table of contents costs from cost of sales  including them in a line item such as selling  general and administrative expenses 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policy regarding cost of sales  including certain buying  occupancy and warehousing expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million 
as a percent to net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by basis points to from last year 
these amounts include million  or basis points  of asset impairment charges related primarily to the impairment of five m o stores this year 
the higher rate this year is primarily due to the comparable store sales decline  partially offset by an improvement in incentive compensation of basis points 
share based payment expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million compared to million last year 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased to million from million last year 
this increase is primarily due to a greater property and equipment base driven by our level of capital expenditures 
as a percent to net sales  depreciation and amortization expense increased to from due to the increased expense as well as the impact of the comparable store sales decline 
other income  net other income  net decreased to million from million  due primarily to interest income decreasing to million from million 
this resulted from decreased interest rates and lower investment balances compared to last year 
additionally  interest expense relating to our borrowings increased 
partially offsetting this decrease was a net million foreign currency transaction gain compared to a million loss last year 
this is the result of a stronger us dollar 
other than temporary impairment charge otti charges relating to our investment securities were million for fiscal there was no otti recorded during fiscal refer to the fair value measurements caption below for additional information 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate increased to approximately from last year 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the otti charges recorded in connection with the valuation of our investment securities in which no income tax benefit was recognized 
net income net income decreased to million  or as a percent to net sales  from million  or as a percent to net sales last year 
net income per diluted share decreased to from last year 
the decrease in net income was attributable to the factors noted above 
the decrease in net income per diluted share was attributable to the factors noted above partially offset by a lower weighted average share count this year compared to last year as a result of share repurchases during fiscal  as well as a lower average price of our common stock during fiscal 
table of contents comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales net sales increased to billion from billion 
the sales increase resulted primarily from an increase in gross square feet due to new and remodeled stores  an increase in sales from our e commerce operation  as well as a increase in comparable store sales 
during fiscal  our ae brand experienced a low single digit increase in average transaction value  driven by a low single digit increase in units per transaction and a slight increase in average unit retail price 
comparable store sales increased in the high single digits in the ae brand men s business and declined in the low single digits in the ae brand women s business over last year 
gross profit gross profit increased to billion from billion in fiscal gross margin as a percent to net sales decreased by basis points to from last year 
the percentage decrease was attributed to a basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate and a basis point increase in buying  occupancy and warehousing costs as a percent to net sales 
merchandise margin decreased for the period due primarily to increased markdowns and merchandise sell offs partially offset by lower product costs 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding merchandise sell offs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing expenses increased basis points as a percent to net sales primarily due to higher rent  as well as delivery costs related to our aeo direct business 
share based payment expense included in gross profit increased to approximately million compared to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million 
however  as a percent to net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses improved by basis points to from last year 
for the period  incentive compensation and supplies expense improved as a percent to net sales partially offset by increases in professional fees and advertising 
share based payment expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million compared to million in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased to million from million 
as a percent to net sales  depreciation and amortization expense increased to from 
these increases are primarily due to a greater property and equipment base driven by our level of capital expenditures 
other income  net other income  net decreased to million from million 
the decrease was primarily due to a million realized capital gain in fiscal and a decrease in our gift card service fee revenue due to the gift card program change that occurred in july these decreases were partially offset by increased investment income resulting from an overall increase in rates compared to fiscal additionally  we recorded a million foreign currency transaction loss as a result of a stronger canadian dollar versus the us dollar compared to a million loss in fiscal prior to july  we recorded gift card service fee income in other income  net 
as of july   we discontinued assessing a service fee on inactive gift cards and now record estimated gift card breakage revenue in net sales 
in fiscal  we recorded gift card service fee income of million compared to million for fiscal for fiscal  we recorded breakage revenue of million in net sales 
this amount included cumulative breakage revenue related to gift cards issued since we introduced the gift card program 

table of contents provision for income taxes the effective tax rate decreased to approximately from in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily related to a reduction in state income taxes and audit settlements 
net income net income increased to a record million  or as a percent to net sales  from million  or as a percent to net sales in fiscal net income per diluted share increased to from in fiscal the increase in net income was attributable to the factors noted above 
the increase in net income per diluted share was attributable to the factors noted above  as well as a lower weighted average share count in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal outlook looking ahead  we expect consumer spending to remain under pressure 
in response  we have planned fiscal with negative comparable store sales and our inventory investment is planned down compared to last year 
additionally  we have reduced budgeted selling  general and administrative expense through various expense reduction initiatives and we have lowered our capital spending plans 
we believe that our current cash holdings and cash generated from operations in fiscal will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
adoption of new accounting standard effective february   we adopted fin as a result of adopting fin  we recorded a net liability of approximately million for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of february  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fin adoption 
income taxes the effective tax rate used for the provision of income tax approximated and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the otti charges recorded in connection with the valuation of our investment securities in which no income tax benefit was recognized 
fair value measurements sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the exit price associated with the sale of an asset or transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of february   for our financial instruments  including its investment securities 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
prior to fiscal  due to the auction process which took place every to days for most of our auction rate securities  quoted market prices were readily available  thus qualifying as level under sfas no 
however  due to events in credit markets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  the auction events for most of these instruments failed and therefore we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities using level and or level inputs 
sfas no 
establishes this three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
our short term investments with active markets  which represent our preferred stock investments  as well as cash and cash equivalents are reported at fair value utilizing level inputs 
for these items  quoted current market prices are readily available 

table of contents level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
we have concluded that the arps with underlyings of publicly traded preferred stock that we have classified as short term represent a level valuation and have been valued using the publicly available trading prices of the underlying preferred shares as the basis for valuation 
level unobservable inputs ie projections  estimates  interpretations  etc 
that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
we have concluded that the ars that we have classified as long term due to failed auctions or that have long term auction resets  as well as arps with underlyings of non publicly traded preferred stock  represent a level valuation and should be valued using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected recovery periods of the ars 
as of january   we held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
these include cash equivalents and short and long term investments  consisting primarily of aaa and aa rated ars and arps 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the following table represents the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets cash equivalents and investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of january  fair value measurements at january  quoted market prices in active significant carrying amount markets for significant other unobservable as of january  identical assets observable inputs inputs level level level in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash money market total cash and cash equivalents short term investments preferred stock auction rate preferred securities total short term investments long term investments student loan backed ars state and local government ars auction rate preferred securities total long term investments total percent to total we used a discounted cash flow dcf model to value our level investments 
the assumptions in our model included different recovery periods depending on the type of security and varying discount factors for yield and illiquidity 
these assumptions are subjective 
they are based on our current judgment and our view of current market conditions 
the use of different assumptions would result in a different valuation and related charge 
for example  an increase in the recovery period by one year would reduce the fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately million 
an increase to the yield and illiquidity premium of basis points would reduce the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately million 

table of contents factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  underlying collateral value  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
as a result of the fair value analysis for fiscal  we recorded a net temporary impairment of million million  net of tax 
this amount was recorded in other comprehensive income oci 
for instruments deemed to be temporarily impaired  we believe that these ars investments can be liquidated through successful auctions or redemptions at par plus accrued interest 
we maintain our ability and intent to hold these investments until recovery of market value and believe that the current illiquidity and impairment of these investments is temporary 
we also recorded otti of million during fiscal the reconciliation of our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level is as follows level unobservable inputs student loan auction backed rate auction auction rate municipal rate preferred total securities securities securities in thousands carrying value at february  additions to level upon adoption of sfas no 
settlements additions to level transfer out of level gains and losses reported in earnings reported in oci balance at january  represents amounts transferred upon the adoption of sfas no 
during the first quarter of fiscal additions to level include securities previously classified as level  which were securities that had experienced partial calls prior to the fourth quarter of and were previously valued at par 
transfers out of level include preferred securities into level and arps into level 
the transfers to level occurred due to the company acquiring exchange traded preferred shares as a result of the arps trusts liquidating 
the transfers to level occurred as a result of the company determining that it was more appropriate to value these investments using observable market prices of the underlying securities 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the otti charge of million that was reported in earnings was taken on level and level securities transferred from level refer to item a as well as notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investment securities  including a description of the securities and a discussion of the uncertainties relating to their liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources our uses of cash are generally for working capital  the construction of new stores and remodeling of existing stores  information technology upgrades  distribution center improvements and expansion  the purchase of both short and long term investments  the repurchase of common stock and the payment of dividends 
historically  these uses of cash have been funded with cash flow from operations 
additionally  our uses of cash include the completion of our new corporate headquarters  the development of aerie by american eagle and kids by american eagle and the continued investment in the operations of martin osa 
we expect to be able to fund our future cash requirements 
table of contents through current cash holdings as well as cash generated from operations 
in the future  we expect that our uses of cash will also include new brand concept development  including development of kids by american eagle 
our growth strategy includes internally developing new brands and the possibility of acquisitions 
we periodically consider and evaluate these options to support future growth 
in the event we do pursue such options  we could require additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in closing any potential transaction  or that any endeavor we undertake would increase our profitability 
the following sets forth certain measures of our liquidity january  february  working capital in s current ratio our current ratio decreased to as of january  from last year due primarily to a decrease in total cash and short term investments as well as an increase in short term notes payable 
notes payable increased by million as a result of drawing on our credit facilities to increase our cash position to add financial flexibility 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal and million during fiscal our major source of cash from operations was merchandise sales 
our primary outflows of cash for operations were for the purchase of inventory and operational costs 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of million from the prior year was due primarily to lower net income driven by lower sales and gross margin 
additionally  the decrease in net cash from operating activities was driven by an increase in prepaid taxes due to the timing of payments and a reduction in accrued compensation due to lower incentive compensation accruals during fiscal cash flows from investing activities investing activities for fiscal included million from the net sale of investments classified as available for sale partially offset by million for capital expenditures 
investing activities for fiscal included million from the net sale of investments classified as available for sale  partially offset by million for capital expenditures 
investing activities for fiscal primarily included million for the net purchase of investments classified as available for sale as well as million for capital expenditures 
we invest our cash primarily in liquid money market funds 
we also have investments  made under our prior investment policy  in auction rate and auction rate preferred securities  with an original contractual maturity of up to years and an expected rate of return of approximately a taxable equivalent yield 
all investments made under our new investment policy must have a highly liquid secondary market at the time of purchase and an effective maturity not exceeding two years 
cash flows from financing activities during fiscal  cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from million used for the payment of dividends partially offset by million in borrowings against our demand line of credit 
during fiscal  cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from million used for the repurchase of our common stock as part of our publicly announced repurchase programs and million used for the payment of dividends 
during fiscal  cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from million used for the repurchase of our common stock and million used for the payment of dividends 
sfas no 
r requires that cash flows resulting from the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be classified as financing cash flows 
accordingly  for fiscal  and  the excess tax benefit from share based payments of million  million and million  respectively  are classified as financing cash flows 

table of contents credit facilities we have borrowing agreements with two separate financial institutions under which we may borrow an aggregate of million 
of this amount  million can be used for demand letter of credit facilities and million can be used for demand line borrowings 
the remaining million can be used for either letters of credit or demand line borrowings at our discretion 
as of january   we had outstanding demand letters of credit of million and demand line borrowings of million 
the outstanding amounts on these facilities can be demanded for repayment by the financial institutions at any time 
additionally  the availability of any remaining borrowings is subject to acceptance by the respective financial institution 
the average borrowing rate on the demand lines for fiscal was and we have incorporated the demand line proceeds into working capital 
the demand line facilities comprising the million borrowing capacity expire on april  we are currently working with our lenders to renew these facilities or to obtain committed credit lines of a comparable amount 
if we are unable to renew both of our demand line facilities  we would be required to repay immediately the million that we have drawn on those facilities 
we believe that this would have no material impact on our ability to fund operations 
capital expenditures fiscal expenditures included million related to investments in our ae stores  including new ae  aerie  and m o stores in the united states and canada  remodeled stores in the united states and fixtures and visual investments 
additionally  we continued to support our infrastructure growth by investing in information technology including the roll out of our new point of sale system million  the expansion and improvement of our distribution centers million  construction of our corporate headquarters in pittsburgh  pennsylvania million and other home office projects million 
for fiscal  we significantly lowered our capital spending plans driven by our decision to open fewer new stores 
therefore  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million with approximately half of the amount relating to store growth and renovation 
this includes approximately new and to remodeled ae stores  including our new flagship store in the times square area of new york  new york  and new aerie stores 
the remaining half relates to the completion of our headquarters  information technology and distribution center projects 
at this time  our capital expenditures projection does not include new m o stores 
stock repurchases during fiscal  our board authorized a total of million shares of our common stock for repurchase under our share repurchase program with expiration dates extending into fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased million shares as part of our publicly announced repurchase programs for approximately million  at a weighted average price of per share 
we did not repurchase any common stock as part of our publicly announced repurchase program during fiscal as of march   we had million shares remaining authorized for repurchase

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk exposure related to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and investment security valuation 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in market interest rates as a result of our investments in money market funds and auction rate securities  which have long term contractual maturities but feature variable interest rates that reset at short term intervals 
if our fiscal average yield rate decreases by in fiscal  our income before taxes will decrease by approximately million 
comparatively  if our fiscal portfolio average yield rate had decreased by in fiscal  our income before taxes would have decreased by approximately million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical yield rates on our cash  short term and long term investment balances 
additionally  borrowings under our demand lines  which expire on april   bear interest at variable rates based on the prime rate or libor 
at january   the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings was 
based upon a sensitivity analysis as of january   assuming average outstanding borrowing during fiscal of million  a basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a potential increase in interest expense of approximately  these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall investments that could happen in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our investments structure 
foreign exchange rate risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate risk primarily through our canadian operations where the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
we do not hedge against foreign currency exchange risks 
we believe our foreign currency translation risk is minimal as a hypothetical change in the canadian foreign exchange rate would not materially affect our results of operations or cash flows

we continue to monitor the market for ars and consider the impact  if any  on the fair value of its investments 
if current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record additional otti and or temporary impairment
