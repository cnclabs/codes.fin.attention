the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a provider of entry level and midrange storage systems and enterprise server software for organizations requiring high reliability  high performance networked storage and data management solutions in an open systems architecture 
our storage solutions consist of integrated hardware  firmware and software products employing a modular system that allows end users to add various capacity or data protection schemes as needed 
our broad range of products  from medium capacity stand alone storage units to complete multi terabyte sans  provide end users with a cost effective means of addressing increasing storage demands without sacrificing performance 
our current product family based on our r evolution architecture provides high performance and large disk array capacities for a broad variety of environments  employing fc  iscsi or sas interconnects to switches and or hosts 
in addition  our assured family of data protection software products provide additional layers of data protection options to complement our line of storage disk arrays 
our current mainstream series of entry level storage products and newer jbod arrays have significantly increased in market share during and are targeted primarily at mainstream enterprise and small to medium business  or smb applications 
our legacy sannet ii products have been distinguished by certification as nebs level and are mil std f compliant based on their ruggedness and reliability  and this legacy is continued in a number of next generation products that we plan to bring to market in in january  we launched a new line of products to address the growing need for smaller form factor  highly dense storage utilizing sas or sata disks  as well as the newest generation of ssds 
in september  we made a significant investment through our acquisition of certain assets  namely raidcore and nas from ciprico 
we believe this acquisition will open up new markets for us in the enterprise server and workstation markets for data protection internal to the servers and workstations 
the acquisition also provided us with a new team of software development professionals located in minneapolis  minnesota 
our products and services are sold worldwide to facilitate server and san storage implementations  primarily through oems  and supplemented by sis  distributors and vars 
our oem channel partners currently include  among others  fujitsu siemens  hp  motorola  nec  netapp and sun 
we began shipping products to hp in the fourth quarter of in january  we amended our agreement with hp to allow for sales to additional divisions within hp 
in september  we further amended the agreement to provide us with the ability to earn a total of million of which million and million 
table of contents was earned and recognized in the three months ended september  and in the three months ended december   respectively 
these amounts represented a reimbursement from hp which was negotiated to effectively defer the price reductions provided to hp  effective july  to january  we were required to meet certain unit shipment quantities during the third and fourth quarter of in order to earn these reimbursements 
we have been shipping our products to sun for resale to sun s customers since october and continue to do so 
however  over the past year we have experienced a decline in net revenues from sun 
the decline in sun net revenue is primarily due to the products nearing the end of their lifecycle and the lack of development of follow on products for the st line to date 
we expect net revenue from sun to continue to decline over future periods 
pursuant to our development and oem supply agreement with netapp  we are designing and developing general purpose disk arrays for a variety of products to be sold under private label by netapp 
we began shipping products to netapp under the agreement for general availability in the third quarter of  and net revenues from netapp increased significantly during pursuant to our master purchase agreement with fujitsu siemens  we jointly developed with fujitsu siemens storage solutions utilizing key components and patented technologies from us 
we began shipping products to fujitsu siemens under the agreement in july our agreements with our channel partners do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and may be terminated at any time upon notice from the applicable partner 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend on  among other things  the level and mix of orders we actually receive from our channel partners  the actual amounts we spend for inventory support and incremental internal investment  our ability to reduce product cost  our product lead time  our ability to meet delivery schedules required by our channel partners and the economic environment 
in addition  the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector  current general economic volatility and trends in the data storage markets in various geographic regions  the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly in the current global economic environment  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  and the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
our strategy includes outsourcing substantially all of our manufacturing to third party manufacturers in order to reduce sales cycle times and manufacturing infrastructure  enhance working capital and improve margins by taking advantage of the third parties manufacturing and procurement economies of scale 
since  we have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to solectron  which was subsequently purchased by flextronics 
in february  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with mitac and synnex 
under the terms of the agreement  mitac supplies us with manufacturing  assembly and test services from its facilities in china and synnex provides us with final assembly  testing and configure to order services through its facilities in fremont  california and telford  united kingdom 
we believe that the agreement with mitac and synnex facilitates our strategic product initiatives  helps to expand our global capabilities and further reduces our manufacturing costs 
we began shipping products for general availability under the mitac and synnex agreement in currently  all of our series and series r evolution products are now manufactured by these partners 

table of contents in september  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with foxconn 
under the terms of the agreement  foxconn will supply us with manufacturing  assembly and test services from its facilities in china and final integration services including final assembly  testing and configure to order services  through its worldwide facilities 
the agreement provides for an initial three year term that is automatically renewed at the end of such three year term for additional one year terms unless and until the agreement is terminated by either party 
we do not anticipate shipping products for general availability under the foxconn agreement until the first half of we derive net revenues primarily from sales of our sannet ii and series family of products and we are in the process of transitioning sannet ii customers to our series and series family of products 
cost of goods sold includes costs of materials  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the production and service departments  depreciation and amortization of equipment used in the production and service departments  production facility rent and allocation of overhead 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  advertising and promotional costs and travel expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of project related expenses and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions  expenditures for administrative facilities as well as expenditures for legal and accounting services and fluctuations in currency valuations 
other income is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
in september we acquired certain identified raidcore and nas assets of ciprico for approximately million  consisting of cash consideration of million  an unsecured non interest bearing promissory note in the amount of million  and contingent consideration in the amount of million 
additionally  we incurred million in acquisition related costs  primarily consisting of legal fees 
payments under the promissory note are due in equal monthly installments over a month period that commenced october  we are also required to pay ciprico earn out payments of up to million over the months following the date of acquisition 
the earn out payments are payable on a quarterly basis and are equal to of raidcore and nas net revenue for the quarterly period 
the contingent consideration liability fair value  as of the acquisition date  is million  of which million is included in accrued expenses and million is included in other long term liabilities 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based on estimated fair values on the transaction date  resulting in the recording of raidcore technology of million and nas technology of million 
the raidcore and nas assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over four years and three years  respectively 
our primary reasons for the acquisition were to allow us to broaden our product portfolio in the raid market while allowing us to sell into the band market  and to pursue opportunities at current and target oem customers 
in december of  our management approved  committed to  and initiated plans to restructure and improve efficiencies in our operations 
costs associated with the restructuring plan totaled million  primarily related to severance and facility costs 
the restructuring was due to a combination of factors  primarily driven by the economic downturn  but also driven by our eventual plan to consolidate our facilities in carlsbad  california into the longmont colorado facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and 
table of contents assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  share based compensation expense  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  uncertain tax positions  tax contingencies  litigation  restructuring costs  purchased intangible asset valuations  long lived asset impairments and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results  future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies applied to our material transactions and used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue for product sales upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer 
customer purchase orders and or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements  when applicable  are used to verify product delivery or that services have been rendered 
we assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess the collectability of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
revenue from product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally to months 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other factors known at the time 
historically these amounts have not been material 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  when we provide consideration to our customers we recognize the value of that consideration as a reduction in revenue 
a majority of our net revenue is derived from a limited number of customers 
we currently have three customers that each account for more than of our total net revenue hp  sun  and netapp 
we typically incur significant design and development costs prior to being designed in with our oem partners 
net revenues by major customers year ended december  sun hp netapp other customers less than total we maintain inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with certain of our larger oem customers 
pursuant to these arrangements  we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer has removed our 
table of contents product from the warehouse 
if a customer does not take our product under a hubbing arrangement in accordance with the schedule it originally provided to us  our future net revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially affected 
valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value  with cost generally determined on a first in  first out basis 
we establish inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
under the hubbing arrangements that we maintain with certain customers  we own inventory that is physically located in a third party s warehouse 
as a result  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  which would cause our total inventory turns to decrease 
in that event  our expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventory could increase and our cash flow could be negatively impacted 
foreign currency transaction and translation a small portion of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the united states dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the united states dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
we have not previously undertaken hedging transactions to cover currency exposure and we currently do not intend to engage in hedging activities in the near future 
during the first quarter of  we closed our operations in the netherlands and transitioned all accounting functions previously performed in that location to our carlsbad location 
during this process  we performed a review of the functional currency for this operation in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
 foreign currency transactions  and based on the changes in operating conditions and economic facts and circumstances  we changed the functional currency for our operation in the netherlands from the euro to the united states dollar effective january  for foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars at period end exchange rates 
revenues and expenses  and gains and losses  are translated at rates of exchange that approximate the rates in effect on the transaction date 
resulting translation gains and losses are recognized as a component of other comprehensive loss 
our international subsidiary that maintains its books of record in a currency other than the functional currency remeasures monetary assets and liabilities using current rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and remeasures non monetary assets and liabilities using historical rates of exchange 
gains and losses from remeasurement for such subsidiary are recognized currently in income as a component of general and administrative expenses 
deferred taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
as a result of our cumulative losses in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  we have concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate in such jurisdictions 
in certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses  we record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the future  if we realize a 
table of contents deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance  we may record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which requires income tax positions to meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements 
under fin  tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
prior to  we recorded estimated income tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the requirement to recognize the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities or deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  or fasb statement no 
r which requires us to record share based compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options and restricted stock awards  for which expense will be recognized over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award  at the date of grant 
the estimation of stock option fair value requires management to make complex estimates and judgments about  among other things  employee exercise behavior  forfeiture rates and the volatility of our common stock 
these judgments directly affect the amount of compensation expense that will ultimately be recognized 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date fair value is calculated based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares granted  and is recognized as expense over the respective vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of fasb statement no 
r but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock options as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use the implied volatility for traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
our selection of the historical volatility approach is due to the limited availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  share based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional stock options to employees our share based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 

table of contents as of december   total unrecognized share based compensation cost related to unvested stock options and awards was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
long lived asset impairment we account for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets which consist primarily of intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or fasb statement no 
we periodically review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment in the carrying value of an asset group is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
as of december   we identified a change in circumstances that indicated the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable due to the recent significant economic downturn  which caused a substantial decline in our market capitalization 
at december   the carrying value of our equity significantly exceeded our market capitalization 
our long lived assets consist of our intangible assets associated with our recent acquisition of certain identified ciprico assets acquired in september with a carrying value of million  our licensed patent portfolio of million and property and equipment of million 
based upon management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows  coupled with the recent acquisition of the ciprico assets which established fair value for the assets  we determined that the carrying value of the acquired ciprico assets approximate fair value and therefore no impairment was identified 
the remaining long lived assets with a carrying value of million were tested for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets were available 
we determined the fair value of the impaired assets by discounting the forecasted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  based on management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections 
our impairment analysis at december  identified million of impaired long lived assets consisting of million of property and equipment and our million licensed patent portfolio 
the long lived asset impairment is recorded as a separate component of operating expense for the year ended december  no impairments of long lived assets were recognized for the years ended december  or valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of fasb statement no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting unit is consistent with the operating and reportable segment identified in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and market capitalization approach 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows 
under the market capitalization approach  valuation multiples are calculated based on operating data from publicly traded companies within our industry 
multiples derived from companies within our industry provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace 
table of contents would be willing to pay for a company 
these multiples are applied to the operating data for the reporting unit to arrive at an indicated fair value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the estimated future discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
we base our fair value estimates on forecasted revenue and operating costs along with business plans 
our forecasts consider the effect of a number of factors including  but not limited to  the effect of the roll out of new products  securing new customers  the effect of the transition to a new contract manufacturer  the ability to reduce product costs and the impact of continued cost savings measures within operating expenses 
it is possible  however  that the plans may change that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
on a quarterly basis throughout we performed a step one impairment test of the goodwill related to our sannet reporting unit through september  based upon the results of our impairment tests  management concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value  and therefore the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required for any quarters through september  for example  for the quarter ended september   our valuation indicated a fair value of million compared to our book value of million 
our step one estimate of fair value using a blend of both the income approach and the market capitalization approach indicated a fair value of million compared to our book value of million as of our measurement date of november  the market value of our common stock declined each quarter during the current year  from a closing stock price of per share at december  to a closing stock price of per share at september  the primary reason for the decline in our valuation from september  to november  was due to the continued decline in the closing stock price of our stock to per share at november   representing a decline 
as a result of these declines  management determined that goodwill was impaired and the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to measure the amount of the impairment  resulting in the recognition of an impairment to goodwill of million 
no impairment losses were recognized during  and we had no goodwill remaining on our balance sheet during contingencies from time to time we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal proceedings 
we prosecute and defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past infringement or to obtain a license under the other party s intellectual property rights that could require one time license fees or running royalties  which could adversely impact gross profit in future periods  or could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such disputes or litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated percentages may not add due to rounding years ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charge legal settlement goodwill and long lived asset impairment charge total operating expenses operating loss other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages net revenue the increase in net revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in net revenue from hp  who sells a version of our series family of products  and from netapp  partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from sun who sells our sannet ii family of products under the st brand product line 
our net revenue from hp for the year ended december  totaled of total net revenue and is net of a million reduction in net revenues  representing the fair value of the warrant issued to hp to induce them to enter into an amended manufacturing agreement with us in january there was no significant net revenue from hp for the year ended december  the substantial increase in hp net revenue is due to the launch and market acceptance of the hp msa product line in march  which is based on our supplied products 
additionally  the hp net revenue included a million reimbursement from hp which was negotiated to effectively defer the price reductions provided to hp effective july  to january  we achieved certain unit shipment quantities for the three months ended september  and december  to earn the reimbursement 
the entire amount is also reflected in gross profit 
our net revenue from netapp increased from the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   net revenue from netapp totaled of our total net revenue  compared to of our total net revenue for the year ended december  the rapid growth in net revenue from netapp was driven by netapp s product launch during the third quarter of  while net revenues consisted of a full year of netapp net revenue 
our net revenues from sun decreased  from the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   net revenue 
table of contents from sun totaled  of our total net revenue  compared to of our total net revenue for the year ended december  the decline in sun net revenue is primarily due to the products nearing the end of their lifecycle and the lack of development of follow on products for the st line having been developed to date 
we expect net revenue from sun to continue to decline over future periods 
cost of goods sold of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold the increase in cost of goods sold in absolute dollars was primarily due to a increase in net revenue 
the slight increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was attributable to a change in product and customer sales mix 
net revenue from our highest margin product  sold to sun and other sannet ii customers  declined as a percentage of total net revenue 
sun net revenue declined from of total net revenue for the year ended december  to of total net revenue for the year ended december  this was replaced by lower margin net revenue from our series products  primarily sold to hp and to a lesser extent to fujitsu siemens  as well as net revenue from product sold to netapp 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue associated with our series products  improved significantly from the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as the series product first started shipping in the third quarter of and was initially manufactured in a mostly soft tooled environment resulting in higher cost of goods sold 
also  we substantially completed the transition of the manufacturing of our series products from flextronics to mitac and synnex and have been able to take advantage of their lower manufacturing costs 
this transition was largely completed during the fourth quarter of in september  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with foxconn 
under the agreement  foxconn will supply us with manufacturing  assembly and test services from its facilities in china and final integration services including final assembly  testing and configure to order services through its worldwide facilities 
we do not anticipate shipping products for general availability under the foxconn agreement until the middle of additionally  the series product cost of goods sold has declined as a percentage of revenue due to our ability to leverage the higher volumes from hp to negotiate lower component costs 
in addition  we have also initiated several value engineering projects to lower product costs 
our historical experience indicates that gross profits on new products sold to new customers start out low initially and increase over the first several quarters 
thereafter the gross profit improvements are generally more modest 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue on our business with netapp improved from the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily for the same reasons as for the series products 
the product we sell to netapp does not include higher margin value added features such as raid controllers 
in the future we anticipate that cost of goods sold  as a percentage of revenue  could decline due to the success of our continued efforts to reduce product costs  primarily through component cost reduction and reengineering efforts  as well as the potential to increase revenue from higher margin products  such as our series products and sales of our dms software and raidcore software 
gross profit of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages gross profit the increase in gross profit in absolute dollars from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in net revenue of million  or  and a change in product and customer mix 
net revenue on our highest margin product  sold to sun  declined as a percentage of total net revenue from of net revenue for the year ended december  to of net revenue for the year ended december  this was replaced by lower margin net revenue 
table of contents from our series products and net revenue from netapp 
net revenue from our series products and net revenue from netapp represented of our net revenue for the year ended december  compared to of our net revenue for the year ended december  additionally  the increase in gross profit is due to the million reimbursement from hp further discussed in net revenue above  as well as million related to a legal settlement 
sales and marketing expenses of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues was primarily attributable to lower salaries  commissions and other employee related expenses of million 
additionally  amortization of intangibles decreased by million and severance decreased by approximately million 
these decreases were offset by an increase in allocated costs of million 
lower overall headcount contributed to the decrease in salaries  commissions and other employee related expenses 
amortization decreased due to our customer relationship intangible asset becoming fully amortized in the decrease in severance was due to the termination of a key employee in one of our international offices in of million offset by severance costs of several sales employees in of million 
allocated costs increased due to an increase in the expenses that are allocable  primarily related to it consultant costs 
research and development expenses of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in project materials and tooling  employee related costs  allocated costs  consultants and amortization of intangibles

costs associated with the restructuring plan totaled million  primarily related to severance of million and facility costs of million 
the restructuring was due to a combination of factors  primarily driven by the economic downturn  but also driven by our eventual plan to consolidate our two facilities in carlsbad  california and longmont  colorado into the longmont  colorado facility

table of contents this decline we determined that the goodwill related to our sannet reporting unit was impaired and the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to measure the amount of the impairment resulting in the recognition of an impairment to goodwill of million 
as of december   we identified a change in circumstances that indicated the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable due to the recent significant economic downturn  which caused a substantial decline in our market capitalization 
at december   the carrying value of our equity significantly exceeded our market capitalization 
our long lived assets consist of our intangible assets associated with our recent acquisition of certain identified ciprico assets acquired in september with a carrying value of million  our licensed patent portfolio of million and property and equipment of million 
based upon management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows  coupled with the recent acquisition of the ciprico assets which established fair value for the assets  we determined that the carrying value of the acquired ciprico assets approximates fair value and therefore no impairment was identified 
the remaining long lived assets with a carrying value of million were tested for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets were available 
we determined the fair value of the impaired assets by discounting the forecasted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  based on management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections 
our impairment analysis at december  identified million of impaired long lived assets consisting of million of property and equipment and our million licensed patent portfolio

at december   based on the weight of available evidence  including cumulative losses in recent years and expectations regarding future taxable income  we determined that it was not more likely than not that our united states deferred tax assets would be realized and have a million valuation allowance associated with our united states deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating losses of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in the tax years ending and  respectively

net revenue from our series products and netapp represented of net revenue for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  margins on our series products for the year ended december  were lower than the corporate average due to two factors 
first  we were in the process of transitioning the manufacturing of our series products from flextronics to mitac and synnex in order to take advantage of lower manufacturing costs 
this transition was completed during the fourth quarter of we also experienced higher inventory reserves  scrap and warranty expenses related to the series products 
second  our historical experience indicates that gross margins on new products sold to new customers start out low initially and increase over the first several quarters as a result of maturing manufacturing processes  component cost reductions and value engineering the products to reduce costs 
thereafter the margin improvements are generally more modest 
during we experienced improved margins on the series products throughout the year 
the margins on our business with netapp were also below corporate averages for two primary reasons 
first  the products we sell to netapp do not include higher margin value added features such as raid controllers 
second  similar to the series products  we are very early in the lifecycle of these products as they were launched during the third quarter of and our historical experience indicates that gross margins on new products start out low initially and increase over the first several quarters as a result of maturing manufacturing processes  component cost reductions and value engineering the products to reduce costs

liquidity and capital resources the primary drivers affecting liquidity and cash are working capital requirements  net profits or losses  legal settlement gains or losses  asset acquisition costs  restructuring charges and capital expenditures 
working capital has been needed to support inventory requirements for some of our larger oem customers  and more recently our acquisition of ciprico s raidcore and nas assets 
historically  the payment terms we have had to offer our customers have been relatively similar to the terms received from our creditors and suppliers 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard payment terms ranging between net and net days 
if in the longer term our net revenues increase  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could further increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers 
furthermore  historically we have had to maintain only a small amount of inventory  as our customers for the most part took delivery of products directly from our contract manufacturer s facility 
beginning in the latter half of  however  we started to hub inventory for some of our larger customers  which has increased our cash usage levels 
in the future  our inventory levels will continue to be determined based upon the level of purchase orders we receive  our ability  and the ability of our customers specifically netapp  hp and fujitsu siemens  to manage inventory under hubbing arrangements  as well as competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels

table of contents for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was attributable to the net loss of million consisting of cash and non cash activities 
the operating activities that affected cash consisted primarily of higher gross profit  resulting largely from the increase in net revenues offset by the changes in customer and product mix  lower interest income  due primarily to lower cash balances and lower reinvestment rates  and increased research and development expense  much of which is associated with the ramp in product sales to hp 
in january  we amended our agreement with hp to provide private label  entry level raid storage arrays to hp 
this amendment resulted in the business rapidly expanding during as hp launched these products in their sales channels 
the non cash operating activities included in the net loss that did not affect cash consisted of the following long lived asset impairment charge of million  depreciation and amortization of million  share based compensation expense of million  and issuance of a warrant to a customer of million 
cash flows from operations reflects the positive impact of million related to an overall increase in accounts payable due to increased inventory and the timing of payments to our vendors  million in proceeds from our chaparral escrow legal settlement  million from another legal settlement and income taxes of million 
cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by a million increase in accounts receivable due to higher net revenues during the quarter ended december  as compared to the quarter ended december  additionally  there was a million increase in inventory primarily due to the creation of new hub inventory locations and the build up of inventory at our existing hub locations for certain of our customers 
furthermore  there was a million decrease in accrued compensation and expenses primarily due to a million reduction in manual receipts of liabilities due to improved processes  a million decrease in our crossroads royalty  a million decrease in an ex officer consulting contract amortization and a million decrease in contract manufacturer liabilities offset by an increase of million related to the current portion of the ciprico loan

there was a million increase in restructuring accrual due to a restructuring charge taken in associated with facility reduction and severance 
other long term liabilities decreased million primarily due to the amortization of our deferred rent of million and amortization of our netapp deferred revenue of million 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in a long term deferred revenue contract that is being accounted for under the completed contract method 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million of cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  cash used during the year ended december  was primarily due to the purchase of certain indentified intangible assets from ciprico in the amount of million and million for the addition of computer hardware and software assets as well as equipment  tooling and leasehold improvements 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the cash provided by financing activities is attributable to the proceeds received from the exercises of stock options under our equity incentive plans of million  and the proceeds received from the sale of common stock to employees under our employee stock purchase plan of million 
we presently expect cash  cash equivalents and cash generated from operations to be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months and for operating periods in excess of months 
in addition  this will enable us to pursue acquisitions or capital improvements 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and timing of the receipt of net revenues from continued operations  the overall level of net profits or losses  our ability to manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers  the potential growth in inventory to support netapp  hp and fujitsu siemens  the status

r 
fasb statement no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement also requires that acquisition related costs are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
fasb statement no 
r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january  we expect fasb statement no 
r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date of january  in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  or fsp fas fsp fas amends fasb statement no

 to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fasb statement no 
 business combinations  and other us gaap 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset is to be applied prospectively  therefore  the impact of the implementation of this pronouncement cannot be determined until the transactions occur 
in october  the company adopted fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  or fsp fas fsp fas applies to financial assets within the scope of accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in accordance with fasb statement no 
this fsp clarifies the application of fasb statement no 
in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the adoption of this fsp did not impact the company s fair value measurements 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  fsp fas will have on our future consolidated financial statements upon full adoption of fasb statement no 
in november  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 accounting for defensive intangible assets 
eitf clarifies the accounting for certain separately identifiable intangible assets which an acquirer does not intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them 
eitf requires an acquirer in a business combination to account for a defensive intangible asset as a separate unit of accounting that should be amortized to expense over the period the asset diminishes in value 
eitf is effective for defensive intangible assets acquired in fiscal years beginning on or after december  the company cannot anticipate whether the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on its future financial statements as the impact depends solely on whether the company acquires any defensive intangible assets on or after january  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
our primary investment strategy is to preserve the principal amounts invested  maintain liquidity and maximize investment yields subject to other investment objectives 
accordingly  we primarily invest in instruments such as money market funds that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
our investment policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short terms to maturity 
as of december   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio at december  for investment securities  the table presents carrying values  and as applicable  related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december in thousands 
cash equivalents including money market accounts average interest rate we have a line of credit agreement  which accrues interest on any outstanding balances at a variable rate 
as of december   we had no balance under this line 
if we incur a balance under this line  we will be exposed to interest rate risk on such debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the united states dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the united states dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
we have not previously undertaken hedging transactions to cover currency exposure and we currently do not intend to engage in hedging activities in the near future 
a unfavorable change in the exchange rate would not materially impact our december  balance sheet 
as we sell products or services in foreign currencies  we are regularly required to convert the payments received into united states dollars or utilize such foreign currencies as payments for expenses of our business  which gives rise to foreign exchange gains and losses 
given the uncertainty as to when and what specific foreign currencies we may be required or decide to accept as payment from our international customers  we cannot predict the ultimate impact that such a decision would have on our business  gross profits and results of operations 
while we monitor our foreign currency exposures  we do not currently maintain an active foreign currency hedging program
