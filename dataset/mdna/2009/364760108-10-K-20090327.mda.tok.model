liquidity and capital resources our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise 
our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases  occupancy costs  personnel related expenses  purchases of property and equipment  and payment of taxes 
in addition  we continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases 

table of contents we consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources in millions january  february  february  cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash debt working capital a current ratio a a our working capital and current ratio calculations include restricted cash 
our working capital and current ratio as of january  increased compared with february  primarily due to decreases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
see cash flows from operating activities below 
as of january   cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash were billion and long term debt of million  classified as current  was repaid in march our cash flow generation remains healthy and our cash position remains strong 
we believe that current cash balances and cash flows from our operations will be adequate to support our business operations  capital expenditures  and the payment of dividends 
we are also able to supplement the near term liquidity  if necessary  with the existing million revolving credit facility 
cash flows from operating activities in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million compared with fiscal primarily due to the following an increased balance in accounts payable in fiscal due to the change in vendor payment terms  a higher payout during the first quarter of fiscal related to the fiscal bonus compared with the prior year comparable period  a decrease in the gift card  gift certificate  and voucher liability due to more redemptions than issuances in fiscal  compared with more issuances than redemptions in fiscal  decreases in accrued liabilities and other current liabilities related to information technology projects and advertising expenses  offset by higher net earnings in fiscal compared with fiscal for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million compared with fiscal  primarily due to the following higher net earnings in fiscal compared with fiscal  a decrease in inventory purchases as a result of our continued focus on inventory management  an increase in accounts payable due to a change in vendor payment terms  and lower income taxes paid in fiscal compared with fiscal inventory management remains an area of focus 
we continue to execute against our strategy of managing inventory levels in a manner that supports healthy merchandise margins

we believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available after the deduction of capital expenditures  as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business 
we use this metric internally  as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation

we also settled the cross currency interest rate swap in march and in connection with this settlement  we received  subsequent to january   million as a return of collateral  which was classified as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet as of january  in december  we paid the remaining million related to the maturity of our percent notes payable and in september  we paid million related to the maturity of our percent notes payable 
credit facilities trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay the vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped 
vendor payables are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer  although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this 
over the past three years  we have migrated most of our merchandise vendors to open account payment terms 
as of january   our letter of credit agreements consist of two separate million  three year  unsecured committed letter of credit agreements  with two separate banks  for a total aggregate availability of million with an expiration date of may in addition  we have an million revolving credit facility available for athleta which is exclusively being used for the issuance of trade letters of credit to support its merchandise purchases 
as of january   we had million in trade letters of credit issued under these letter of credit agreements 
we also have a million  five year  unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in august the facility 
the facility is available for general corporate purposes  including commercial paper backstop  working capital  trade letters of credit  and standby letters of credit 
the facility usage fees and fees related to the facility fluctuate based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio 
if we were to draw on the facility  interest would be a base rate typically the london interbank offered rate plus a margin based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount 
to maintain availability of funds under the facility  we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount  regardless of usage 
as of january   there were no borrowings under the facility

a violation of these covenants could result in a default under the facility and letter of credit agreements  which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the facility for letters of credit and advances  terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements  require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the facility  and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements

other cash obligations not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet off balance sheet arrangements the majority of our contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for our stores 
commitments for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases

purchase obligations include our non exclusive services agreement with international business machines corporation ibm to operate certain aspects of our information technology structure 
the agreement was amended march  the services agreement expires in march  and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years 
we have various options to terminate the agreement  and we pay ibm under a combination of fixed and variable charges  with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services 
ibm also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure 
based on the current projection of service needs  we expect to pay approximately million to ibm over the remaining term of the contract 
we have assigned certain store and corporate facility leases to third parties as of january  under these arrangements  we are secondarily liable and have guaranteed the lease payments of the new lessees for the remaining portion of our original lease obligation 
we account for these guarantees in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
the maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make is approximately million as of january  the carrying amount of the liability related to the guarantees was not material as of january  we are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters 
these contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts  operating leases  trademarks  intellectual property  financial agreements  and various other agreements 
under these contracts we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties eg  ownership of assets  environmental or tax indemnifications or personal injury matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
generally  the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and  as a result  the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
we believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters  the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
as party to a reinsurance pool for workers compensation  general liability  and automobile liability  we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of million  of which million has been cash collateralized 
we are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large  global corporation 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
our significant accounting policies can be found in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors  and the audit and finance committee of our board of directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
merchandise inventory we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and use markdowns to clear merchandise 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market lcm and record a reserve when future estimated selling price is less than cost 
our lcm reserve calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the amount of slow moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns  which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise  inventory aging  forecasted consumer demand  and the promotional environment 
in addition  we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends 
historically  actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lcm or inventory shortage reserves 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be affected 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our lcm or inventory shortage reserves in the past three fiscal years 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill  and intangible assets in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review the carrying value of long lived assets  including lease rights  key money  and intangible assets subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store  corporate facility  or distribution center  or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long lived asset 
for assets that are identified as potentially being impaired  if the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value of the asset is estimated based on discounted future cash flows of the assets using a discount rate commensurate with the risk 
our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets 
these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results  real estate demand  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
we have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long lived assets in the past three fiscal years 
we recorded charges for the impairment of long lived assets of million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the impairment charge in fiscal and included million and million  respectively  related to the discontinued operation of forth towne 

table of contents in connection with the acquisition of athleta in september  we allocated million of the purchase price to goodwill and million to trade name 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we review the carrying value of goodwill and the trade name for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate  declines in our operating results  or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we assess potential impairment considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations 
the fair value of the reporting unit used to test goodwill for impairment and the fair value of the trade name are estimated using the income approach 
this approach requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales and expenses which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for our goodwill or other intangible assets in fiscal   or we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment losses of long lived assets  goodwill  and intangible assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
insurance and self insurance we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risk management activities including workers compensation  general liability  and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our employees 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially determined amounts  and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions 
any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes  health care costs  and claim settlement patterns 
historically  actual results for estimated losses have not differed materially from our estimates 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our insurance liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
revenue recognition while revenue recognition does not involve significant judgment  it represents an important accounting policy for the company 
we recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers 
for store sales  revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register  primarily with either cash or credit card 
for sales from our online and catalog business  revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise 
we record an allowance for estimated returns based on estimated gross profit using our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future sales returns in the past three fiscal years 
unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and vouchers upon the purchase of a gift card or issuance of a gift certificate or voucher  a liability is established for its cash value 
the liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer 
over time  some portion of these instruments is not redeemed breakage 
we determine breakage income for gift cards  gift certificates  and vouchers based on historical redemption patterns 
breakage income is recorded as other income  gap inc 
form k 
table of contents which is a component of operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings when it can be determined that the likelihood of redemption is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions 
during fiscal  we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording breakage income associated with unredeemed gift cards to three years from our prior estimate of five years and  as a result  recorded million of other income in fiscal for gift certificates and vouchers  we recognize breakage income after five years 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future earnings  taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
at any point in time  many tax years are subject to or in the process of audit by various taxing authorities 
to the extent that our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made 
our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  in accordance with fin determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities  changes in facts and circumstances  issuance of new regulations  and resolution of tax audits

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate in foreign countries  which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations and forecasted royalty payments using foreign exchange forward contracts 
we also use forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany loans and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding or issuing the intercompany loan or balance 
these contracts are entered into with large  reputable financial institutions  which are monitored for counterparty risk 
the principal currencies hedged during fiscal were us dollars  euro  british pounds  japanese yen  and canadian dollars 
our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management  we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
additional information is presented in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of january  and february   based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates to us dollars with all other variables held constant on our underlying exposure  net of derivative financial instruments 
the foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect at january  and february  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have had an unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow exposure  net of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments  of million at january  and million at february  we do not have significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings 
we use a cross currency interest rate swap to swap the interest and principal payable of the million debt of our japanese subsidiary  gap japan kk  from a fixed interest rate of percent  payable in us dollars  to billion japanese yen with a fixed interest rate of percent 
this debt was repaid in march the fair value of this debt was million and million as of january  and february   respectively and classified as current maturities of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of january  in connection with the repayment of million related to the maturity of this debt  we settled the corresponding cross currency interest rate swap in march in addition  we invest in fixed and variable income investments classified as cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments are placed primarily in treasury and prime money market funds  domestic commercial paper  and bank securities 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
an increase in interest rates of percent would not have a material impact on the value of these investments 
however  changes in interest rates would impact the interest income derived from our investments 
we earned interest income of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively
