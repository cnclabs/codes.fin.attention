item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item herein 
management is of the opinion that inflation and changing prices  including foreign exchange fluctuations  will have little  if any  effect on our consolidated financial position or results of our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates involve the use of complicated processes  assumptions  estimates and or judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the consolidated financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors and have identified the following critical accounting policies for the current fiscal year 
principles of consolidation we consolidate entities when we have the ability to control the operating and financial decisions and policies of that entity and record the portion we do not own as minority interest 
the determination of our ability to control or exert significant influence over an entity involves the use of judgment 
we apply the equity method of accounting where we can exert significant influence over  but do not control  the policies and decisions of an entity 
we use the cost method of accounting where we are unable to exert significant influence over the entity 
change in fiscal year on april   we changed our fiscal year to end on april th rather than the last sunday in april 
we previously ended our fiscal year on the last sunday in april due to our previous relationship with ic bh and isle which used this year end 
as a result  fiscal year began on april  and will end april  we believe this fiscal year creates more comparability to other companies in the casino industry 
fiscal year commenced on april  and ended on april  there are no factors  seasonal or otherwise  that would impact the comparability of information or trends equity method of accounting our previous investments in ic bh  american racing  rci  buena vista development and route sunrise were accounted for using the equity method of accounting because the investment gave us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investees 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist where we have an ownership interest in the investee of between and  although other factors such as the degree of ultimate control  representation on the investee s board of directors or similar oversight body are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
we recorded our equity in the income or losses of our investees using the same reporting periods as presented  except we reported our equity in income or losses one month in arrears for rci and american racing which had a calendar fiscal year  and one month in arrears for buena vista development and sunrise which had a fiscal year end of march 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded for allocated earnings or losses of our equity investments that were not currently reportable or deductible for federal income tax purposes 
we utilized the equity method of accounting for our interest in route casinos because the operating activities of the joint venture were controlled by the minority venturer 
we were involved in legal proceedings with the minority venturer in route casinos in which the minority venturer asserted that the operating agreement governing the venture was void and unenforceable 
we assessed whether this circumstance indicated utilization of the cost method of accounting for this investment was appropriate and concluded that the equity method best reflected the underlying nature of our investment 
the operating agreement provided that all material decisions of the joint venture were made by the members  including us  on a unanimous basis 
we believed the operating agreement to be binding and enforceable on the venture and our joint venture partner and  therefore  we concluded that we had significant influence over the affairs of the venture 
capitalized development costs we capitalize certain third party legal  professional  and other miscellaneous fees directly related to the procurement  evaluation and establishment of contracts for development projects 
development costs are recorded on the cost basis and are amortized over the estimated economic term of the contract 
we review each project on a quarterly basis to assess whether any changes to our estimates are appropriate 
if accumulated costs of a specific project exceed the net realizable value of such project or the project is abandoned  the costs are charged to earnings 
we amortize capitalized development costs of oceans casino cruises  inc suncruz  over the contractual two year term of the management contract 
each month we recognize as expense a percentage of our capitalized development costs determined by dividing actual accrued costs incurred with the procurement of the contract divided over the life of the contract 
we believe this method is appropriate because it provides income and expenses over the term of the contract 
we receive a monthly management fee from suncruz as well as reimbursement for any reasonable expenses incurred 
goodwill and other intangibles in connection with our acquisition of the colorado grande casino on april   we have goodwill with an indefinite useful life of million 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of our goodwill below its carrying value 
we completed an impairment test as required under sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
for properties with goodwill with indefinite lives  this test requires the comparison of the implied fair value of each property to its carrying value 
the implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
changes in estimates or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
asset and investment impairments we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  to account for asset and investment impairments 
under these standards  we evaluate an asset or investment for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recovered 
these events include market declines that are believed to be other than temporary  changes in the manner in which we intend to use a long lived asset  decisions to sell an asset or investment and adverse changes in the legal or business environment such as adverse actions by regulators 
when an event occurs  we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on either i the long lived asset s ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis or ii the fair value of our investment in unconsolidated affiliates 
if an impairment is indicated or if we decide to exit or sell a long lived asset or group of assets  we adjust the carrying value of these assets downward  if necessary  to their estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
our fair value estimates are generally based on market data obtained through the sales process or an analysis of expected discounted cash flows 
the magnitude of any impairments are impacted by a number of factors  including the nature of the assets to be sold and our established time frame for completing the sales  among other factors 
we also reclassify the asset or assets as either held for sale or as discontinued operations  depending on  among other criteria  whether we will have any continuing involvement in the cash flows of those assets after they are sold 
based upon this policy  we reduced our investment in horizon casino vicksburg by million as of april   and in fiscal year  we reduced our investment in sunrise land minerals corporation sunrise by  reduced a note receivable and related accrued interest from big city capital by million and wrote off million of notes receivable  related accrued interest and our equity investment in the la jolla gaming development project as of april  allowance for doubtful accounts we establish provisions for losses on accounts and notes receivable if we determine that we will not collect all or part of the outstanding balance 
we regularly review collectibility and establish or adjust our allowance as necessary using the specific identification method 
we make advances to indian tribes and other third parties under executed promissory notes for project costs related to the development of gaming and entertainment properties 
due diligence is conducted by our management with the assistance of legal counsel prior to entering into arrangements with indian tribes and other third parties to provide financing in connection with their efforts to secure and develop the properties 
repayment terms are largely dependent upon the operating performance of each opportunity for which the funds have been loaned 
interest income is not accrued until it is reasonably assured that the project will be completed and that there will be sufficient profits from the facility to cover the interest to be earned under the respective note 
if projected cash flows are not sufficient to recover amounts due  the note is evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  to determine the appropriate discount to be recorded on the note for it to be considered a performing loan 
if the note is performing  interest is recorded using the effective interest method based on the value of the discounted note balance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we review on a quarterly basis each of our notes receivable to evaluate whether the collection of such note receivable is still probable 
in our analysis  we review the economic feasibility and the current financial  legislative and development status of the project 
if our analysis indicates that the project is no longer economically feasible then the note receivable would be written down to its estimated fair value 
revenue recognition we record revenues from management fees  interest on notes receivable and royalties on the accrual basis as earned 
the dates on which payments are collected may vary depending upon the term of the contracts or note receivable agreements 
interest income related to notes receivable is recorded when earned and its collectibility is reasonably certain 
the retail value of food and beverage and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and deducted as promotional allowances 
net revenues do not include the retail amount of food  beverage and other items provided gratuitously to customers 
the company records the redemption of coupons and points for cash as a reduction of revenue 
these amounts are included in promotional allowances in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated cost of providing such complimentary services that is included in casino expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was as follows fiscal year ended april  april  food and beverage other total cost of complimentary services accrued jackpot liability we accrue jackpot liability as games are played under a matching concept of coin in 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the use of an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences  using currently enacted tax laws  attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we record current income taxes based on our current taxable income  and we provide for deferred income taxes to reflect estimated future tax payments and receipts 
we account for tax credits under the flow through method  which reduces the provision for income taxes in the year the tax credits first become available 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based on our estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period 
the estimates utilized in recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision  either up or down  in future periods based on new facts or circumstances 
accrued litigation liability we assess our exposure to loss contingencies including legal matters 
if the potential loss is justified to be probable and estimable  we will provide for the exposure 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate  operating results could be impacted 
as of april   we did not record any accrued litigation liability 
restatement as discussed in item a  the company did not maintain effective control over financial reporting as it relates to its tax provision as of april  to mitigate the material weakness  management has engaged a tax expert to assist in preparation and review of the company s tax provision during as a result of the new control in place  management identified an error in prior year tax provision  accordingly  the following items in the previously reported consolidated financial statements are restated

net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year compared to million net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year during fiscal year  we repaid a net million of our credit facility compared to a net to our credit facility and million repaid on our term loans in fiscal year future sources and uses of cash we expect that our future liquidity and capital requirements will be affected by capital requirements related to future acquisitions  cash flow from acquisitions  management contracts  working capital requirements  obtaining funds via long term subordinated debt instruments  debt service requirements  and disposition of non gaming related assets 
at april   outstanding indebtedness was million which is not due until june  historically  tax distributions from ic bh  monetizing non core assets  and repayments from affiliates have been sufficient to satisfy our current debt obligations and working capital needs 
we no longer receive cash flow from these sources 
in addition to cash flow expected to be generated from the colorado grande casino and existing management contracts  we anticipate that cash flow from notes receivable and the recently acquired mini casinos in washington state will generate sufficient cash flow 
on june   we sold our membership interest in american racing and entertainment 
we received million cash and two notes for million each 
the notes bear interest of and were paid on june  and  respectively 
on june   we used the proceeds from the sale of american racing to repay million of our previously held million credit facility credit facility

on june   we drew down million from the credit facility 
in addition  in conjunction with the sale agreement we were indemnified by the purchasers in connection with the guarantees of approximately million of debt or any other obligations of american racing 
on march   the million debt was refinanced and the company was released from being a guarantor 
we have continued to examine our corporate overhead 
as a result  we have implemented several cost saving measures that have saved approximately million of general and administrative expenses annually 
these measures included the elimination of several senior level positions and a number of corporate staff positions which resulted in a reduction in our corporate full time equivalents 
these cost savings have continued during fiscal year on january   we sold our ownership interest in ic bh to our partner for million in cash 
on the same date we repaid million of the credit facility 
in addition  from proceeds of the sale a million project fund was established and a million deposit was escrowed in regards to our proposed acquisition of the vicksburg horizon casino and hotel in vicksburg  mississippi

on december  the company received million in cash for our ownership of bvd 
the cash and a million receivable due no later than two years after the gaming entertainment facility opens  paid in full the million note receivable and accrued interest 
we have listed the acres in black hawk  co with a real estate broker 
if the acreage is sold we will use the proceeds to pay operating expenses or debt or  reinvest the funds into acquisition opportunities 
on april   excluding restricted cash of million  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the restricted cash is the project fund referred to above 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will have adequate availability of cash resources to satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have made  and are in the process of making  arrangements to ensure that we have sufficient working capital to fund our obligations as they come due 
these potential funding transactions include divesting of non core assets and obtaining long term financing 
we believe that some or all of these sources of funds will be funded in a timely manner and will provide sufficient working capital for us to meet our obligations as they come due  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in divesting of the non core assets or achieving the desired level of working capital at terms that are favorable to us 
should cash resources not be sufficient to meet our current obligations as they come due  repay or refinance our long term debt due on june  and  acquire operations that generate positive cash flow  we would be required to curtail our activities and grow at a pace that cash resources could support which may require a restructuring of our debt or selling core assets of the company 
indebtedness effective march   we entered into a million loan agreement with our lender that replaced the million credit facility with the same lender 
the principal bears interest at per annum and has a maturity date of june  the loan is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in fiscal year  we repaid million of notes payable 
as of april   we had million in outstanding debt under the loan agreement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  including interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk  commodity price and equity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is credit risk concentrations 
we do not believe we are subject to material interest risk 
all of our borrowings are at fixed interest rates  thus an interest rate change would not have a significant impact on our operations
