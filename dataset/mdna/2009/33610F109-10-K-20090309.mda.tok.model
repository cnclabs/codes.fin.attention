critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap that require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require subjective or complex judgments and are the policies and estimates that the company deems most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations 
it is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  including evaluation of the collectability of accounts receivable  impairment of long lived assets  purchase accounting for acquisitions of real estate and share based compensation 
the following is a summary of certain aspects of these critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition rental revenue under leases with scheduled rent increases or rent abatements is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the leases 
accrued straight line rents included in the company s consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over contractual rent under applicable lease provisions 
the company s leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of the company s property operating expenses and real estate taxes 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized on the date of termination when the related leases are canceled and the company has no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
the company must make estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  tenant reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income as a higher required allowance for doubtful accounts receivable will result in lower net income 
the uncollectible portion of the amounts due from tenants  including straight line rents  is charged to property operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
investments in real estate and real estate entities investments in real estate are recorded at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life  increase capacity  or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows buildings years building improvements to years furniture  fixtures and equipment to years tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the terms of the related leases lease related intangible assets term of related lease the company regularly reviews market conditions for possible impairment of a property s carrying value 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of its investments in real estate 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions or changes in management s intended holding period indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  an impairment analysis is performed 
the company assesses the recoverability based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
this estimate is based on projections of future revenues  expenses  capital improvement costs and expected holding periods and cap rates 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
the company identified no impairment in the value of its properties at december  the company will classify a building as held for sale in the period in which it has made the decision to dispose of the building  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
if these criteria are met  the company will record an impairment loss if the fair value of the building  less anticipated selling costs  is lower than its carrying amount 
the company will classify any impairment loss  together with the building s operating results  as discontinued operations on its statement of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets 
interest expense is reclassified to discontinued operations only to the extent the property to be disposed of secures specific mortgage debt and the debt will not be transferred to another of the company s properties after the disposition 
on june   the company sold its alexandria corporate park property formerly in the company s northern virginia reporting segment 
alexandria corporate park was among several properties that served as collateral on a million fixed rate mortgage loan issued by jackson national life insurance company 
during june  the company removed alexandria corporate park from the loan s collateral base and replaced it with two properties  northridge i ii and john marshall highway 
since the debt remained encumbered to properties that are wholly owned by the company  interest expense was not reclassified to discontinued operations 
otherwise  operating results and the gain on disposal for these assets are reflected as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company has had and will have no continuing involvement with the property subsequent to its disposal 
during may  the company sold its property located at business parkway formerly in the company s maryland reporting segment 
as a result  operating results and the gain on disposal for these assets are reflected as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company has had and will have no continuing involvement with the property subsequent to its disposal 
purchase accounting acquisitions of rental property from third parties are accounted for at fair value  which is allocated between land and building on an as if vacant basis based on management s estimate of the fair value of those components for each type of property and to tenant improvements based on the depreciated replacement cost of the tenant improvements  which approximates the fair value 
the purchase price is also allocated as follows the value of leases in place on the date of acquisition are based on the leasing origination costs at the date of the acquisition  which approximates the market value of the lease origination costs had the in place leases been originated on the date of acquisition  the value of in place leases represents absorption costs for the estimated lease up period in which vacancy and foregone revenue are incurred  the value of above and below market in place leases based on the present value using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between the contractual rent amounts to be paid under the lease and the estimated fair market lease rates for the corresponding spaces over the remaining non cancelable terms of the related leases  which range from one to nineteen years  and the intangible value of tenant or customer relationships 
the company s determination of these values requires it to estimate market rents for each of the leases and make certain other assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the rental revenue  depreciation expense and amortization expense it recognizes for these leases and associated intangible assets and liabilities 
goodwill and impairment analysis in conjunction with the company s initial public offering and related formation transactions  first potomac management  inc contributed all of the capital interests in first potomac management llc  the entity that manages the company s properties  to the operating partnership 
the million fair value of the in place workforce acquired has been classified as goodwill in accordance with sfas and is included as a component of intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles sfas all acquired goodwill that relates to the operations of a reporting unit and is used in determining the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to the company s appropriate reporting unit in a reasonable and consistent manner 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment annually at the end of its fiscal year and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating the carrying value may be impaired 
the company performs its analysis for potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas  which requires that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired  and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference 
the company s assessment of goodwill impairment involved multiple approaches 
the company performed a discounted cash flow analysis to compare the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of each unit 
in consideration of the limited transactions in the marketplace  disruption in the financial markets and overall recession  the company calculated a range of cash flows utilizing both historical data and stress test type inputs to evaluate worst case scenarios 
the results of the cash flow analysis showed no impairment in company s goodwill  therefore the company did not perform a step impairment analysis 
the company also performed a reconciliation of the estimated fair value of our reporting units to market capitalization to further assess any indicators of impairment 
the methodology applied was to calculate the aggregate fair value  using the cash flow approach discussed  less applicable indebtedness 
the aggregate net asset value exceeded the company s equity market capitalization due to the control premium that would be implied in such an analysis as well as the market discount currently experienced by other similar organizations in the industry 
no impairment losses were recognized during the years ended december   and investment in joint venture the company may continue to seek to grow its portfolio by entering into joint venture agreements 
the structure of the joint venture will affect the company s accounting treatment for the joint venture 
if the company meets the requirements of the equity method of accounting  it will account for its initial investment within its balance sheets as investment in affiliates 
the company s respective share of all earnings from the joint venture will be presented on its statements of operations as equity in earnings with a corresponding entry on the balance sheet to investment in affiliates 
all distributions received from the joint venture will be recorded as a reduction in investment in affiliates 
if the company does not meet the requirements of the equity method of accounting  it will consolidate all of the joint venture s operating results within its consolidated financial statements 
the cash contributed to the joint venture by the third party  if any  will be reflected in the liability section of the company s balance sheets under financing obligation 
the amount will be recorded based on the third party s initial investment in the joint venture and will be adjusted to reflect the third party s share of earnings in the joint venture or any distributions received by the third party from the joint venture 
the earnings from the joint venture attributable to the third party are recorded as interest expense on the financing obligation within company s consolidated statements of operations 
all distributions received by the company from the joint venture will be recorded as a reduction in the financing obligation 
derivative instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
the company may enter into derivative agreements to mitigate exposure to unexpected changes in interest rates and may use interest rate protection or cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate changes 
the company intends to enter into derivative agreements only with counterparties that it believes have a strong credit rating to mitigate the risk of counterparty default or insolvency 
the company may designate a derivative as either a hedge of the cash flows from a debt instrument or anticipated transaction cash flow hedge or a hedge of the fair value of a debt instrument fair value hedge 
all derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value 
for effective hedging relationships  the change in the asset or liabilities  fair value is offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  an element of shareholders equity cash flow hedge  or through earnings  along with the change in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged fair value hedge 
ineffective portions of derivative transactions will result in changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  the company has considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual inputs and guarantees 
share based compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which require that the cost for all share based payment transactions be recognized as a component of income from continuing operations 
the standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period

the company considers ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of its properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization  which assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  the company believes that ffo provides a meaningful indication of its performance 
management also considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure given its wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts 
ffo  reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions  principally adjusts for the effects of gaap depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  which assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  ffo represents net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses on sales of real estate  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with nareit s definition  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo  or similarly titled measures  used by other companies and this may not be comparable to those presentations 
the company s methodology for computing ffo adds back minority interest in the income from its operating partnership in determining ffo 
the company believes this is appropriate as operating partnership units are presented on an as converted  one for one basis for shares of stock in determining ffo per fully diluted share 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the company s presentation of ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of its liquidity
