item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we currently operate in three primary business segments manufacturing  refurbishment parts and leasing services 
these three business segments are operationally integrated 
the manufacturing segment  operating from four facilities in the united states  mexico and poland  produces double stack intermodal railcars  conventional railcars  tank cars and marine vessels 
the refurbishment parts segment performs railcar repair  refurbishment and maintenance activities in the united states and mexico as well as wheel  axle and bearing servicing  and production and reconditioning of a variety of parts for the railroad industry 
the leasing services segment owns approximately  railcars and provides management services for approximately  railcars for railroads  shippers  carriers  institutional investors and other leasing and transportation companies in north america 
management evaluates segment performance based on margins 
we also produce rail castings through an unconsolidated joint venture 
all segments of the north american and european freight car markets in which we operate are currently experiencing depressed demand in a weak economy  market saturation of certain freight car types and tight capital markets 
all of the aforementioned contribute to increased caution on the part of our customers and intensified competitive circumstances 
these market factors have led and may continue to lead to lower revenues and reduced margins for some of our operations 
in response to these market conditions we are concentrating our north american railcar manufacturing at our mexican joint venture facility in frontera  temporarily shuttering production at our other mexican facility in sahagun and limiting new railcar production at our portland  oregon facility 
these conditions may also lead to the temporary idling of some of our other facilities 
the rail industry is cyclical in nature and multi year supply agreements are a part of industry practice 
customer orders may be subject to cancellations and contain terms and conditions customary in the industry 
historically  little variation has been experienced between the product ordered and the product actually delivered 
recent economic conditions have caused some customers to consider renegotiation  delay or cancellation of orders 
the backlog is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
our total manufacturing backlog of railcars for sale and lease as of august  was approximately  units with an estimated value of billion  compared to  units valued at billion as of august  based on current production plans  approximately  units in backlog are scheduled for delivery in fiscal year there are currently units in backlog that are subject to certain cancellation provisions 
a portion of the orders included in backlog reflects an assumed product mix 
under terms of the orders  the exact mix will be determined in the future which may impact the dollar amount of backlog 
in addition  a substantial portion of our backlog consists of orders for tank cars which are a new product type for us in north america 
in we entered into a long term contract with general electric railcar services corporation ge to build  tank cars and covered hoppers over an eight year period 
deliveries of the railcar units commenced in december our railcar backlog as of august  includes approximately  units to be produced for ge with a current value of approximately million 
under the ge contract  the first  tank cars and  covered hopper cars were to be delivered during a ramp up period ending april  during which period our production of tank cars was to accelerate as our tank car manufacturing process becomes more efficient and in turn ge s order quantities of tank cars and covered hopper cars were to increase through such period 
in october  we and ge agreed to extend the end of the ramp up period from april to september the remaining  railcars under the agreement are to be delivered over the balance of the eight year period and are subject to our fulfillment of certain contractual conditions 
in late calendar year  ge advised us of their desire to substantially reduce  delay or otherwise cancel deliveries under the contract 
we have not agreed to ge s requested reductions in deliveries  and believe that a unilateral reduction of the number of railcar deliveries from what was previously agreed upon is a breach of the agreement 
currently  we continue to produce and deliver  and ge continues to accept and pay for  tank cars and covered hopper cars 
through october  ge has accepted  and we have delivered  tank cars and covered hopper cars 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents we believe that ge is in breach of the contract 
we are continuing to discuss with ge potential modifications to the contract 
if we are unable to agree on mutually acceptable modifications to the contract  we may have to either substantially slow or halt production of these railcars  or else store completed cars pending resolution of these issues 
we are unable to quantify at this time the potential financial effects of ge s breach of the agreement or failures by ge to perform the ge contract 
we believe the contract contains adequate protection in that it defines the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to railcar purchase and sale requirements and inspection standards and that both the contract and law provide effective legal and equitable remedies 
marine backlog was approximately million as of august   of which approximately million is scheduled for delivery in fiscal year the balance of the production is scheduled into prices for steel  a primary component of railcars and barges  and related surcharges have fluctuated significantly and remain volatile 
in addition  the price of certain railcar components  which are a product of steel  are affected by steel price fluctuations 
subsequent to  prices for steel  railcar components and scrap steel have declined but remain volatile 
new railcar and marine backlog generally either includes fixed price contracts which anticipate material price increases and surcharges  or contracts that contain actual pass through of material price increases and surcharges 
on certain fixed price railcar contracts actual material cost increases and surcharges caused the total manufacturing cost of the railcar to exceed the original expectation  and in some cases  the actual contractual price of the railcar 
when an anticipated loss on production of railcars in backlog is both probable and estimable  we accrue a loss contingency 
we are aggressively working to mitigate these exposures 
the company s integrated business model has helped offset some of the effects of fluctuating steel and scrap steel prices  as a portion of our business segments benefit from rising steel scrap prices while other segments benefit from lower steel and scrap steel prices through enhanced margins 
we delivered railcar units during for which we have an obligation to guarantee the purchaser minimum earnings 
the obligation expires december  the maximum potential obligation totals million and in certain defined instances the obligation may be reduced due to early termination 
the purchaser has agreed to utilize the railcars on a preferential basis  and we are entitled to re market the railcar units when they are not being utilized by the purchaser during the obligation period 
any earnings generated from the railcar units will offset the obligation and be recognized as revenue and margin in future periods 
we believe our actual obligation will be less than the million 
upon delivery of the railcar units  the entire purchase price was recorded as revenue and paid in full 
the minimum earnings due to the purchaser are considered a reduction of revenue and were recorded as deferred revenue 
as of august  we have recorded million of the potential obligation as deferred revenue 
in we implemented measures to reduce our selling and administrative and overhead costs  including reductions in headcount 
as a result  during fiscal year million was expensed for severance costs  of which million was recorded in cost of revenue and million in selling and administrative cost 
we test goodwill annually during the third quarter using a testing date of february th 
the annual test performed in indicated that goodwill was impaired 
as a result  a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million was recorded  in our third quarter  which consists of million in the manufacturing segment  million in the leasing services segment and million in the refurbishment parts segment 
after goodwill impairment charges  a balance of million remained in goodwill related to the refurbishment parts segment 
effective february  we entered into an agreement with our mexican joint venture partner  grupo industrial monclova gimsa  whereby greenbrier converted working capital advances to our mexican joint venture of million to a secured  interest bearing loan 
greenbrier may from time to time provide additional loans to the joint venture 
in addition  greenbrier has acquired an option from our joint venture partner to increase our current fifty percent ownership to sixty six and two thirds percent 
on january   the wheel facility in washington  illinois was extensively damaged by fire 
substantially all the work scheduled to be completed at this facility has been shifted to other wheel facilities in the refurbishment parts network and we have not experienced significant disruptions in service to our customers 
this facility has now been closed 
we believe we are adequately covered by insurance for any such loss associated with this fire 
a portion of the insurance proceeds were received during the fourth quarter and it is likely that we will recover additional the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents amounts under our insurance coverage  a portion of which may be recorded as a gain in future periods 
we are currently unable to determine the amount or timing of the collection of the remaining proceeds or these potential gains 
results of operations overview total revenue was billion  billion and billion for the years ended august   and net loss for the year ended august  was million or per diluted common share which included million of special charges net of tax 
net earnings for the year ended august  were million or per diluted common share which included million of special charges net of tax 
net earnings for the year ended august  were million or per diluted common share which included million of special charges net of tax 
manufacturing segment manufacturing revenue includes new railcar and marine production 
new railcar delivery and backlog information disclosed herein includes all facilities 
manufacturing revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and railcar deliveries  which are the primary source of manufacturing revenue  were approximately  units in compared to  units in and  units in manufacturing revenue decreased million  or  from to primarily due to lower railcar deliveries and an million obligation of guaranteed minimum earnings under a certain contract 
the decrease was somewhat offset by a change in product mix with higher per unit sales prices and higher marine revenues 
manufacturing revenue decreased million  or  from to due to lower railcar deliveries primarily due to the current economic slowdown of the north american market 
manufacturing margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the decrease was primarily the result of the million obligation of guaranteed minimum earnings under a certain contract  higher material costs and scrap surcharge expense  severance expense of million and less absorption of overhead due to lower production levels and plant utilization 
these were partially offset by improved marine margins as a result of labor efficiencies and a continuous run of similar barge types and a million reduction of warranty accruals 
manufacturing margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the decrease was primarily due to rising steel prices and surcharges  loss contingencies of million accrued on certain future production  million of severance  lower production levels and additional start up costs at our mexican joint venture facility  partially offset by relief of certain contractual obligations 
refurbishment parts segment refurbishment parts revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million decrease in revenue from to was primarily due to lower wheel and parts volumes  reduced volumes of railcar repair and refurbishment work  a sharp decrease in scrap metal pricing and lower wheelset pricing 
the million increase in revenue from to was primarily due to a full year of revenue from the meridian rail acquisition which was completed in november  million of additional revenue related to american allied railway equipment company aare and rbi acquisitions  strong wheelset volumes and higher scrap steel prices 
refurbishment parts margin as a percentage of revenue was  and for  and the decrease in fiscal margins was primarily due to lower net scrap pricing  less favorable mix of repair and refurbishment work and million in severance 
higher margins in were a result of the growth of our wheel business  which includes a full year of meridian rail and the acquisition of aare which occurred early in the third quarter of fiscal  higher margin wheel reconditioning work and the positive impact of higher scrap steel prices 
this was partially offset by lower volumes of program work at the repair facilities 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents leasing services segment leasing services revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a million decrease in gains on disposition of assets from the lease fleet  lower lease fleet utilization  downward pressures on lease renewal rates  lower earnings on certain car hire utilization leases and lower maintenance revenues 
the million decrease in revenue from to was primarily the result of a million decrease in gains on sale of assets from the lease fleet  lower interim rents on assets held for sale and decreased interest income from lower cash balances 
the decline was partially offset by higher car hire revenue from additions to the lease fleet and increased maintenance revenue 
during  we realized million in pre tax earnings on the disposition of leased equipment compared to million in and million in assets from our lease fleet are periodically sold in the normal course of business in order to take advantage of market conditions  manage risk and maintain liquidity 
leasing services margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in and in the decrease in was primarily the result of decreases in gains on disposition of assets from the fleet  which have no associated cost of revenue  lower lease fleet utilization  downward pressure on lease renewal rates and lower earnings on certain car hire utilization leases 
the decrease from to was primarily a result of declines in gains on disposition of assets from the lease fleet  interest income and interim rents on assets held for sale  all of which have no associated cost of revenue 
the percent of owned units on lease as of august  was compared to at august  other costs selling and administrative expense was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million decrease from to is primarily due to lower employee related costs  continued cost reduction efforts in the current economic environment and reversal of million of certain accruals 
the decrease was partially offset by severance costs of million related to reductions in work force 
the million increase from to is primarily due to increased employee costs including severance of million related to reductions in work force  integration costs of recent acquisitions and costs associated with our mexican joint venture facility that commenced production in may  partially offset by the closure of our canadian facility 
interest and foreign exchange expense was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million increase from to is due to million in warrant amortization expense  million acceleration of loan fee amortization associated with the reduction in size of the north american credit facility  million to break interest rate swaps associated with the voluntary prepayment of approximately million of certain long term debt and million increase in foreign exchange losses 
these were partially offset by favorable interest rates on our variable rate debt and lower debt levels 
the warrants  issued in conjunction with the million secured term loan  were valued at million and will be amortized through june the annual amortization is expected to be million for the year ending august   million for the year ending august  and million for the year ending august  results include foreign exchange losses of million compared to foreign exchange losses of million in principally due to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
the million increase from to was primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations 
special charges of million were recorded in may associated with the impairment of goodwill 
these charges consist of million in the manufacturing segment  million in the leasing services segment and million in the refurbishment parts segment 
in april  the company s board of directors approved the permanent closure of the company s canadian railcar manufacturing facility  trentonworks 
as a result of the facility closure decision  special charges of million were recorded during consisting of severance costs and professional and other fees 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents special charges of million were recorded during associated with the impairment and subsequent closure of trentonworks 
these charges consist of million of impairment of property  plant and equipment  million of inventory impairment  million impairment of goodwill and other  million of severance costs and million of professional and other fees 
income tax our effective tax rate was  and for the years ended august   and the lower tax rate in was primarily the result of a goodwill impairment charge for which a tax benefit was recorded at  as a portion of the impairment charge was not deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  included a reversal of million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities  a tax benefit of million related to the deemed liquidation of our german operation for us tax purposes and a tax benefit of million related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability associated with a foreign subsidiary 
tax expense for included a million charge associated with deferred tax assets and operating losses without tax benefit incurred by our canadian subsidiary during its closure process 
included a million increase in valuation allowances related to net operating losses generated in poland and mexico 
in addition  a million tax benefit resulted from reversing income tax reserves associated with certain tax positions taken in prior years 
tax expense for included an million tax benefit associated with the write off of our investment in our canadian subsidiary for tax purposes and no tax benefit associated with special charges related to the canadian plant closure costs and losses incurred by the canadian facility 
also included tax benefits of approximately million for mexican asset based tax credits and amended state income tax provisions 
the fluctuations in the effective tax rate are also due to the geographical mix of pre tax earnings and losses  minimum tax requirements in certain local jurisdictions and operating losses for certain operations with no related accrual of tax benefit 
minority interest the minority interest of million  million and million for the years ended august   and represents our joint venture partner s share in the losses of our mexican railcar manufacturing joint venture that began production in liquidity and capital resources we have been financed through cash generated from operations and borrowings 
at august  cash was million  an increase of million from million at the prior year end 
cash increases were primarily from decreased levels of operation which lead to lower working capital needs  additional focus on working capital management  proceeds from sales of equipment and million in secured term loans  of which a portion of the proceeds were used to pay off certain notes payable and revolving notes 
cash provided by operating activities for the years ended august   and was million  million and million 
the change was primarily due to lower working capital needs as a result of decreased levels of operation 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended august  was million compared to million in and million in cash utilization was primarily due to capital expenditures during the year 
cash utilization in was primarily due to the acquisitions of aare and rbi and capital expenditures for the year 
increased cash utilization for was primarily due to the acquisitions of meridian rail holdings corp 
meridian and rail car america rca 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million for the years ended august   and of these capital expenditures  approximately million  million and million for the years ended august   and were attributable to leasing services operations 
our capital expenditures have decreased based on current market conditions and fleet management objectives 
we regularly sell assets from our lease fleet  some of which may have been purchased within the current year and included in capital expenditures 
proceeds from the sale of equipment were approximately million  million and the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents million for the years ended august   and leasing services capital expenditures for  net of proceeds from sales of equipment  are expected to be minimal 
approximately million  million and million of capital expenditures for the years ended august   and were attributable to manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for manufacturing are expected to be approximately million in and primarily relate to maintenance of existing equipment and erp implementation 
refurbishment parts capital expenditures for the years ended august   and were million  million and million and are expected to be approximately million in for maintenance of existing facilities  erp implementation and some expansion 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended august  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in during  we repaid million in net revolving credit lines and million in term debt and paid dividends of million 
we received million in net proceeds from term loan borrowings 
during  we received million in net proceeds from term loan borrowings and million in net proceeds under revolving credit lines 
in  we repaid million in term debt and paid dividends of million 
all amounts originating in foreign currency have been translated at the august  exchange rate for the following discussion 
as of august  senior secured revolving credit facilities  consisting of two components  aggregated million 
as of august  a million revolving line of credit was available to provide working capital and interim financing of equipment  principally for the united states and mexican operations 
advances under this revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates that depend on the type of borrowing and the defined ratio of debt to total capitalization 
in addition  current lines of credit totaling million  with various variable rates  are available for working capital needs of the european manufacturing operation 
currently these european credit facilities have maturities that range from april through june we regularly seek european credit facility renewals and expect the available credit facilities to be approximately million through june  as of august  outstanding borrowings under our facilities consists of million in letters of credit outstanding under the north american credit facility and million in revolving notes outstanding under the european credit facilities 
the revolving and operating lines of credit  along with notes payable  contain covenants with respect to the company and various subsidiaries  the most restrictive of which  among other things  limit the ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees  pay dividends or repurchase stock  enter into sale leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  including joint ventures and non us subsidiaries  including but not limited to loans  advances  equity investments and guarantees  enter into mergers  consolidations or sales of substantially all the company s assets  and enter into new lines of business 
the covenants also require certain maximum ratios of debt to total capitalization and minimum levels of fixed charges interest and rent coverage 
on june   we received a million secured term loan from affiliates of wl ross co 
llc wl ross maturing in june the loan contains no financial ratio covenants and has a variable interest rate of libor plus 
in connection with the loan we issued warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at per share 
the warrants have a five year term 
concurrent with the wl ross loan  we amended our north american revolving credit facility and reduced the size of the facility from million to million 
the amendment provides for more accommodative financial covenants effective as of may  and increased the interest rate to libor plus 
the maturity of the facility remains unchanged at november as part of the amendment  goodwill impairment charges are excluded from the financial covenant ratio calculations 
available borrowings under our credit facilities are generally based on defined levels of inventory  receivables  property  plant and equipment and leased equipment  as well as total debt to consolidated capitalization and interest the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents coverage ratios which  as of august  would allow for maximum additional borrowing of million 
the company has an aggregate of million available to draw down under the committed credit facilities as of august  this amount consists of million available on the north american credit facility and million on the european credit facilities 
we have operations in mexico  germany and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
foreign operations give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
greenbrier utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts with established financial institutions to hedge a portion of that risk 
no provision has been made for credit loss due to counterparty non performance 
currently we are seeking a third party line of credit to support our mexican joint venture due in part to current limitations in our existing loan covenants 
in the interim  greenbrier is financing the working capital needs of the joint venture through a million secured  interest bearing loan 
subsequent to year end  our mexican joint venture obtained a million term loan  secured by certain of the joint venture s property  plant and equipment 
in accordance with customary business practices in europe  we have million in bank and third party performance  advance payment and warranty guarantee facilities  all of which have been utilized as of august  to date no amounts have been drawn under these performance  advance payment and warranty guarantees 
quarterly dividends were suspended as of the third quarter a quarterly dividend of 
per share was declared during the second quarter of quarterly dividends of 
per share were declared each quarter from the fourth quarter of through the first quarter of we have advanced million in long term advances to an unconsolidated subsidiary which are secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
as of august   this same unconsolidated subsidiary had million in third party debt for which we have guaranteed or approximately million 
the facility has been idled and expects to restart production when demand returns 
we  along with our partners  have made an additional investment during the first quarter of  our share of which was million 
additional investments may be required later in the year 
we expect existing funds and cash generated from operations  together with proceeds from financing activities including borrowings under existing credit facilities and long term financing  to be sufficient to fund dividends  working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and expected debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
the following table shows our estimated future contractual cash obligations as of august  years ending august  in thousands total thereafter notes payable interest revolving notes purchase commitments operating leases railcar leases other due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at august   we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority

see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates may affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities within the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position taken in preparation of a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different than that taken by us  differences in tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
maintenance obligations we are responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the underlying lease or management agreement 
the estimated maintenance liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of railcar 
these estimates involve judgment as to the future costs of repairs and the types and timing of repairs required over the lease term 
as we cannot predict with certainty the prices  timing and volume of maintenance needed in the future on railcars under long term leases  this estimate is uncertain and could be materially different from maintenance requirements 
the liability is periodically reviewed and updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or refurbishment requirements 
these adjustments could be material due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting future maintenance requirements 
warranty accruals warranty costs to cover a defined warranty period are estimated and charged to operations 
the estimated warranty cost is based on historical warranty claims for each particular product type 
for new product types without a warranty history  preliminary estimates are based on historical information for similar product types 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they are based on historical data for existing products and judgment for new products 
if warranty claims are made in the current period for issues that have not historically been the subject of warranty claims and were not taken into consideration in establishing the accrual or if claims for issues already considered in establishing the accrual exceed expectations  warranty expense may exceed the accrual for that particular product 
conversely  there is the possibility that claims may be lower than estimates 
the warranty accrual is periodically reviewed and updated based on warranty trends 
however  as we cannot predict future claims  the potential exists for the difference in any one reporting period to be material 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents railcars are generally manufactured  repaired or refurbished under firm orders from third parties 
revenue is recognized when railcars are completed  accepted by an unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed 
direct finance lease revenue is recognized over the lease term in a manner that produces a constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
operating lease revenue is recognized as earned under the lease terms 
certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on utilization  car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement 
car hire revenue is reported from a third party source two months in arrears  however  such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to actual as reported 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they involve judgment as to the estimated use of each railcar 
adjustments to actual have historically not been significant 
revenues from construction of marine barges are either recognized on the percentage of completion method during the construction period or on the completed contract method based on the terms of the contract 
under the percentage of completion method  judgment is used to determine a definitive threshold against which progress towards completion can be measured to determine timing of revenue recognition 
impairment of long lived assets when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets are evaluated for impairment 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value is recognized in the current period 
these estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the impairment and could be materially different if circumstances change 
certain long lived assets were tested for impairment during the quarter ended may  forecasted undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the assets indicating that the assets were not impaired 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets the company periodically acquires businesses in purchase transactions in which the allocation of the purchase price may result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the amount of future period amortization and possible impairment charges 
we perform a goodwill impairment test annually during the third quarter 
goodwill is also tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists 
the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on observed market multiples for comparable businesses 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required only in situations where the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value as determined in the first step 
in the second step we would compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
loss contingencies on certain railcar contracts the total cost to produce the railcar may exceed the actual fixed or determinable contractual sale price of the railcar 
when the anticipated loss on production of railcars in backlog is both probable and estimable the company will accrue a loss contingency 
these estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the accrual and may be adjusted at a later date to reflect actual costs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in mexico  germany and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
at august   million of forecast sales in europe were hedged by foreign exchange contracts 
because of the variety of currencies in which purchases and sales are transacted and the interaction between currency rates  it is not possible to predict the impact a movement in a single foreign currency exchange rate would have on future operating results 
we believe the exposure to foreign exchange risk is not material 
in addition to exposure to transaction gains or losses  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to the net asset position of our foreign subsidiaries 
at august   net assets of foreign subsidiaries aggregated million and a strengthening of the united states dollar relative to the foreign currencies would result in a decrease in stockholders equity of million  of total stockholders equity 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
interest rate risk we have managed a portion of our variable rate debt with interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
as a result  we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our revolving debt and a portion of term debt  which are at variable rates 
at august   of our debt has fixed rates and has variable rates 
at august   a uniform increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense
