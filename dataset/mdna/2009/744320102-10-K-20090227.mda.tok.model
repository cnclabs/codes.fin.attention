item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the forward looking statements included below the table of contents  risk factors  selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
overview prudential financial has two classes of common stock outstanding 
the common stock  which is publicly traded nyse pru  reflects the performance of the financial services businesses  while the class b stock  which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange  reflects the performance of the closed block business 
the financial services businesses and the closed block business are discussed below 
financial services businesses our financial services businesses consist of three operating divisions  which together encompass seven segments  and our corporate and other operations 
the us retirement solutions and investment management division consists of our individual annuities  retirement and asset management segments 
the us individual life and group insurance division consists of our individual life and group insurance segments 
the international insurance and investments division consists of our international insurance and international investments segments 
our corporate and other operations include our real estate and relocation services business  as well as corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments 
corporate and other operations also include businesses that have been or will be divested  including our investment in the retail brokerage joint venture with wachovia securities  and businesses that we have placed in wind down status 
we attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment  excluding financing costs associated with corporate debt which costs are reflected in corporate and other operations 
the net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of capital that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment 
we seek growth internally and through acquisitions  joint ventures or other forms of business combinations or investments 
our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines  both domestic and international 
closed block business in connection with the demutualization  we ceased offering domestic participating products 
the liabilities for our traditional domestic in force participating products were segregated  together with assets  in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the closed block 
the closed block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the closed block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits  including policyholder dividends  expenses and taxes with respect to these products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the closed block 
at the time of demutualization  we determined the amount of closed block assets so that the closed block assets initially had a lower book value than the closed block liabilities 
we expect that the closed block assets will generate sufficient cash flow  together with anticipated revenues from the closed block policies  over the life of the closed block to fund payments of all expenses  taxes  and policyholder benefits to be paid to  and the reasonable dividend expectations of  holders of the closed block policies 
we also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies 
no policies sold after demutualization will be added to the closed block  and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full 
we also expect the proportion of our business represented by the closed block to decline as we grow other businesses 
concurrently with our demutualization  prudential holdings  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential financial that owns the capital stock of prudential insurance  issued billion in senior secured notes  which we refer to as the ihc debt 
the net proceeds from the issuances of the class b stock and ihc debt  except for million used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt  were allocated to the financial services businesses 
however  we expect that the ihc debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the closed block business over time  and we include interest expenses associated with the ihc debt when we report results of the closed block business 
the closed block business consists principally of the closed block  assets that we must hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies  invested assets held outside the closed block that represent the difference between the closed block assets and closed block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve  deferred policy acquisition costs related to closed block policies  the principal amount of the ihc debt and related hedging activities  and certain other related assets and liabilities 
the closed block business is not a separate legal entity from the financial services businesses  however  they are operated as separate entities and are separated for financial reporting purposes 
the financial services businesses are not obligated to pay dividends on closed block policies 
dividends on closed block policies reflect the experience of the closed block over time and are subject to adjustment by prudential insurance s board of directors 
further  our plan of demutualization provides that we are not required to pay dividends on policies within the closed block from assets that are not within the closed block and that the establishment of the closed block does not represent a guarantee that any certain level of dividends will be maintained 
revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums  mortality  expense  and asset management and administrative fees from insurance and investment products  and investment of general account and other funds 
we earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and group life and disability insurance 
we earn mortality  expense  and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities 
we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution  servicing and management of mutual funds  retirement products and other asset management products and services 
our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided  general business expenses  dividends to policyholders  commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities 
profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price and manage risk on insurance products  our ability to attract and retain customer assets and our ability to manage expenses 
specific drivers of our profitability include our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products that gain market acceptance on a timely basis  our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers and administering those products  our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance  annuity and group disability insurance products  which can fluctuate significantly from period to period  our persistency experience  which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts  our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services  our returns on invested assets  including the impact of credit impairments  net of the amounts we credit to policyholders accounts  the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value  which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive  our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation  our credit and financial strength ratings  our ability to effectively utilize our tax capacity  our returns on proprietary investments we make  and our ability to manage risk and exposures  including the degree to which  and the effectiveness of  hedging these risks and exposures 
in addition  factors such as general economic conditions  securities  credit and real estate market conditions  regulation  competition  interest rates  taxes and foreign exchange rates affect our profitability 
in some of our product lines  particularly those in the closed block business  we share experience on mortality  morbidity  persistency and investment results with our customers  which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products 
historically  the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses 
as we have ceased offering domestic participating products  we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age  and we grow other businesses 
however  the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years 
our common stock reflects the performance of our financial services businesses  but there can be no assurance that the market value of the common stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses 
see risk factors for a discussion of risks that have affected and may continue to affect our business  results of operations or financial condition  cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company

through our subsidiaries and affiliates  we offer a wide array of financial products and services  including life insurance  annuities  retirement related services  mutual funds  investment management  and real estate services 
we offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry 
current developments financial markets 
the stress experienced by global financial markets  that began in the second half of  continued and substantially increased since then 
the volatility and disruption in the global financial markets have reached unprecedented levels 
the availability and cost of credit has been materially affected 
these factors  combined with economic conditions in the us  including depressed home prices and increasing foreclosures  falling equity market values  declining business and consumer confidence  and rising unemployment  have precipitated a severe economic recession and fears of even more severe and prolonged adverse economic conditions 
the global fixed income markets are experiencing a period of both extreme volatility and limited market liquidity conditions  which has affected a broad range of asset classes and sectors 
as a result  the market for fixed income instruments has experienced decreased liquidity  increased price volatility  credit downgrade events  and increased probability of default 
these events in the credit markets as well as volatility in equity and real estate markets have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on us 
in response to the market dislocation affecting the banking system and financial markets  on october   president bush signed the emergency economic stabilization act of  or eesa  into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets 
on october   the us treasury announced that it would use eesa authority to invest an aggregate of billion of the first billion released under eesa in capital issued by qualifying us financial institutions under the us treasury s capital purchase program  which is part of the troubled asset relief program  or tarp 
the tarp capital purchase program involves the issuance by qualifying institutions of preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to the us treasury 
concurrently  in coordination with the us treasury  the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guarantee program  through which it guarantees certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by fdic insured institutions and their qualifying holding companies  as well as funds over  in non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts 
in addition  since march  the federal reserve has created several lending facilities to stabilize financial markets 
most recently on november   the federal reserve announced the term asset backed securities loan facility  or talf 
the talf has not yet been finalized but is designed to provide secured financing for newly issued asset backed securities backed by certain types of consumer and small business loans 
on february   the us treasury announced a financial stability plan to build upon existing programs and earmark the second billion of funds that were authorized under the eesa and released in january the elements of the financial stability plan  as described by the us treasury  are a capital assistance program and financial stability trust to make capital available to financial institutions through additional purchases of preferred stock  a public private investment fund to buy legacy loans and assets from financial institutions  a consumer and business lending initiative to restart securitization markets for loans to consumers and businesses by expanding upon talf  and a comprehensive housing program to  among other things  help reduce mortgage payments and interest rates 
the us treasury has stated that the financial stability plan will require high levels of transparency and accountability standards and dividend  acquisition and executive compensation restrictions for financial institutions that receive government assistance going forward 
as a result of the volatility and disruption in the global financial markets  we took certain actions during the fourth quarter of and into  including the following suspended all repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program  effective october  we do not anticipate reinstituting a share repurchase program in reduced the annual common stock dividend by  to per share 
redeployed certain assets to our domestic insurance subsidiaries from our non insurance subsidiaries  including contributing our wachovia securities joint venture interest to prudential insurance  to maintain the risk based capital level necessary to meet our ratings objectives for our domestic insurance subsidiaries 
announced our intention to exercise our right under the lookback option to put our wachovia securities joint venture interest to wells fargo  which acquired wachovia on december  under the terms of the joint venture agreements  closing of the put transaction would occur in january applied for participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program  although no determination has been made with regard to our participation 
drew billion of collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york  or fhlbny  with approximately billion of total estimated borrowing capacity remaining at december   as discussed in more detail in liquidity and capital resources prudential financial alternative sources of liquidity federal home loan bank of new york 
in february  prudential insurance issued collateralized funding agreements in the amount of billion to the fhlbny 
both prudential financial and prudential funding  llc participated in the commercial paper funding facility  or cpff  sponsored by the federal reserve bank of new york 
as a consequence of the commercial paper credit rating of prudential financial being downgraded by fitch  as described further in business ratings  prudential financial will no longer be eligible to issue commercial paper under the cpff 
reduced the level of proprietary investing in our asset management segment  to limit our exposure to public equity and real estate markets  and utilized the cash proceeds for capital and liquidity needs 
ceased sales of certain annuity products 
streamlined and enhanced data collection  analysis and decision making related to risk management 
we continue to monitor the liquidity and capital needs of prudential financial and its subsidiaries 
if the disruption in the credit and capital markets continues or worsens  we will need to take additional capital management actions to maintain capital consistent with our rating objectives  which may include additional internal actions or  if internal resources are insufficient or market conditions continue to deteriorate  access to external sources of capital if available 
certain of these capital management activities may require regulatory approval 
in addition  in light of the significant impact the dramatic decline in equity markets had on our results and potential for continued significant volatility  we are assessing the appropriate level of equity risk for our businesses 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  rating agencies took certain steps with respect to prudential financial and its subsidiaries 
refer to business ratings for more details 
our financial condition and results of operations reflect the following our financial services businesses had a net loss of billion in  as unfavorable financial market conditions had a substantial negative effect on our investment portfolio  resulting in net realized investment losses  and on reported results of our domestic businesses 
our individual annuities segment reported a loss of billion in  based on pre tax adjusted operating income  primarily reflecting increases in reserves and amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs largely reflecting the impact of current market conditions 
for a definition of adjusted operating income and a discussion of its use as a measure of segment operating performance  see consolidated results of operations 
pre tax net realized investment losses and related adjustments of the financial services businesses were billion in  primarily reflecting other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities of billion 
net unrealized gains losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the financial services businesses amounted to an unrealized loss of billion as of december   compared to an unrealized gain of billion as of december  gross unrealized gains increased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  and gross unrealized losses increased from billion to billion for the same periods 
the increase in gross unrealized losses was primarily due to credit spread widening in the credit markets and an increase in the liquidity premium demanded in the marketplace 
net unrealized gains losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the closed block business amounted to an unrealized loss of billion as of december   compared to an unrealized gain of million as of december  charges for impairments of goodwill and operating joint ventures had a negative pre tax impact of million on results of the financial services businesses in these charges related to writeoffs of goodwill within our individual annuities and international investments segments and our real estate and relocation business within corporate and other operations  as well as impairments of the carrying value of investments in certain operating joint ventures within our international investments segment 
as of december   prudential financial  the parent holding company  had cash and short term investments of billion  however  adverse capital market conditions have affected and may continue to affect the availability and cost of borrowed funds and could impact our ability to refinance existing borrowings 
for our international insurance and group insurance businesses had record levels of adjusted operating income 
during the quarter ended december   we continued to have positive net flows in our domestic annuity  retirement and asset management businesses  as well as solid sales in our domestic insurance businesses and sales growth in our international insurance segment 
outlook the global and us economic conditions are expected to further weaken in credit and capital markets are expected to remain under severe stress and us housing prices may continue to decline 
such conditions have and could continue to materially and adversely affect our business volumes  profit margins and credit costs 
as we manage through this challenging economic environment  we continue to focus on long term strategic positioning and growth opportunities  including the following us retirement and investment management market 
we look to capitalize on the growing need of baby boomers for products that provide guaranteed income for longer retirement periods 
in addition  we continue to focus on our clients increasing needs for retirement income security given the volatility in the financial markets 
us insurance market 
our focus remains on solid sales in our us insurance businesses which we expect to continue to benefit from expansion of our distribution channels and deepening our relationships with third party distributors 
international markets 
we continue to concentrate on expanding our operations in a limited number of attractive countries and on deepening our presence in the markets in which we currently operate 
we look to capitalize on opportunities arising in international markets as changing demographics and public policy have resulted in a growing demand for retirement income products similar to those offered in the us results of operations we analyze performance of the segments and corporate and other operations of the financial services businesses using a measure called adjusted operating income 
see consolidated results of operations for a definition of adjusted operating income and a discussion of its use as a measure of segment operating performance 
shown below are the contributions of each segment and corporate and other operations to our adjusted operating income for the years ended december   and and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income of our segments and corporate and other operations to income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures

results for included billion of charges from these items  largely reflecting the impact of current market conditions  compared to million of benefits in also contributing to the decline was a million unfavorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features  and a decrease in fee income  driven by lower average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts 
retirement segment results for included an million charge related to payments made to plan clients associated with a legal action filed against an unaffiliated asset manager 
absent the impact of this item  results for decreased in comparison to  primarily reflecting higher general and administrative expenses  driven by expenses incurred to expand our full service product and service capabilities and to support several large client sales in  and a decrease in asset management fees  driven by a decrease in average full service fee based retirement account values  primarily resulting from equity market depreciation 
an increased benefit from reserve refinements of million  primarily reflecting updates of client census data on our group annuity blocks of business  partially offset these decreases 
asset management segment results declined in largely due to unfavorable results from the segment s proprietary investing business primarily related to investment results in fixed income and equity investments  as well as a decrease in performance based incentive fees  primarily related to institutional real estate funds 
these items were partially offset by higher asset management fees and higher income related to securities lending activity 
individual life segment results for declined from primarily due to a net increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  due to the impact of unfavorable equity markets on separate account fund performance  including the impact of equity market future rate of return assumptions 
adjusted operating income in both the current year and prior year periods benefited from the annual reviews of the assumptions underlying the estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves  which benefited the current year period million and the prior year period million 
group insurance segment results for improved from reflecting higher earnings in our group life business from more favorable claims experience and the benefit from a premium adjustment for updated data on a large case  as well as growth in our group disability business 
the international insurance segment is comprised of its life planner and gibraltar life operations 
results from the segment s life planner operations improved in primarily reflecting continued growth of our japanese life planner operations and  to a lesser extent  improved investment income margins 
results from the segment s gibraltar life operation benefited in from improved investment income margins  the continued growth of our us dollar denominated annuity product  and more favorable mortality experience 
international investments segment results declined primarily reflecting impairment charges of million recorded during the fourth quarter related to operating joint ventures and goodwill 
corporate and other results for declined from primarily due to losses in our real estate and relocation services business  including a charge for goodwill impairment of million 
realized investment gains losses  net  and related adjustments for the financial services businesses in amounted to a loss of billion  primarily reflecting other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities of billion 
income from continuing operations before income taxes in the closed block business decreased million in compared to  primarily reflecting a decrease in net realized gains and net investment income  which was partially offset by the resulting decrease in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense 
accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements 
if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances  results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly 
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
valuation of investments  including the recognition of other than temporary impairments as prescribed by us gaap  we present our investments classified as available for sale  including fixed maturity and equity securities  and our investments classified as trading  such as our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value in the statements of financial position 
the fair values for our public fixed maturity securities and our public equity securities are generally based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent pricing services  which we validate for reasonability 
however  for our investments in private securities such as private placement fixed maturity securities  which comprise of our investments as of december   this information generally is not available 
for these private fixed maturities  fair value is determined typically by using a discounted cash flow model  which utilizes a discount rate based upon the average of spread surveys collected from private market intermediaries who are active in both primary and secondary transactions and takes into account  among other factors  the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with private placements 
in determining the fair value of certain securities  the discounted cash flow model may use unobservable inputs  which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities private fixed maturities credit quality and realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities for information regarding the credit quality of the private fixed maturity securities included in our general account 
for additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities  as well as derivative instruments and other investments  see valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities 
for our investments classified as available for sale  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net  a separate component of equity 
for our investments classified as trading  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
in addition  investments classified as available for sale  as well as those classified as held to maturity  are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent and duration of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value credit event  currency or interest rate related  including credit spread widening  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment  we write down the value of the security to its fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
in addition  for our impairment review of asset backed fixed maturity securities with a credit rating below aa  we forecast our best estimate of the prospective future cash flows of the security to determine if the present value of those cash flows  discounted using the effective yield of the most recent interest accrual rate  has decreased from the previous reporting period 
when a decrease from the prior reporting period has occurred and the security s fair value is less than its carrying value  an other than temporary impairment is recognized by writing the security down to its fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
in both cases  this corresponding charge to earnings is referred to as an impairment 
impairments are reflected in realized investment gains losses  net in the statements of operations and are excluded from adjusted operating income 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
in periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment  the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment 
accordingly  the discount or reduced premium based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment income  and included in adjusted operating income in future periods based upon the amount and timing of the expected future cash flows of the security  if the recoverable value of the investment based upon cash flows we can reasonably estimate  is greater than the carrying value of the investment after the impairment 
the level of impairment losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses for a discussion of the effects of impairments on our operating results for the years ended december   and given recent market conditions and liquidity concerns  beginning in the third quarter of  our determinations of whether a decline in value of fixed maturity securities is other than temporary have placed greater emphasis on our internal analysis of the underlying credit and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  versus the extent and duration of a decline in fair value 
for a further discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording fixed maturity and equity securities other than temporary impairments  see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities and realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments equity securities other than temporary impairments of equity securities 
commercial mortgage and other loans  which comprise of our investments as of december   are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances  net of unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses 
the valuation allowance provides for the risk of credit losses inherent in the lending process and includes a loan specific reserve for each non performing loan that has a specifically identified loss and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses 
non performing loans include those loans for which it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
the loan specific portion is based on our assessment as to ultimate collectability of loan principal and interest 
valuation allowances for non performing loans are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers our past loan experience  the current credit composition of the portfolio  historical credit migration  property type diversification  default and loss severity statistics and other relevant factors 
we record subsequent increases or decreases to our valuation allowances when appropriate 
adjustments to the allowance are reflected in realized investment gains losses  net  in our statements of operations 
similar to impairment losses discussed above  the allowance for losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments commercial mortgage and other loans commercial mortgage and other loan quality for a discussion of the effects of the valuation allowance on our operating results for the years ended december  and see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments for a discussion of our investment portfolio  including the gross unrealized gains and losses as of december   related to the fixed maturity and equity securities of our general account  our policies and procedures regarding the identification of other than temporary declines in investment value  and the carrying value  credit quality  and allowance for losses related to the commercial mortgage and other loans of our general account 
policyholder liabilities future policy benefit reserves  other than unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses we establish reserves for future policy benefits to or on behalf of policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued 
these reserves relate primarily to the traditional participating whole life policies of our closed block business and the non participating whole life  term life  and life contingent structured settlement and group annuity products of our financial services businesses 
the future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of our closed block business  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by us gaap 
under this method  the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder 
in applying this method  we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums  and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums 
the mortality assumptions used are based on data from the standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies  and the interest rates used are the contractually guaranteed interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policy 
gains or losses in our results of operations resulting from deviations in actual experience compared to the experience assumed in establishing our reserves for this business are recognized in the determination of our annual dividends to these policyholders 
since the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization  these gains or losses generally do not create significant volatility in our results of operations 
however  if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense  these gains or losses could result in greater volatility in our results of operations 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million 
the future policy benefit reserves for our international insurance segment and individual life segment  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves combined  relate primarily to non participating whole life and term life products and are determined in accordance with us gaap as the present value of expected future benefits to or on behalf of policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums 
the expected future benefits and expenses are determined using assumptions as to mortality  lapse  and maintenance expense 
reserve assumptions are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net us gaap liabilities us  reserves net of any dac asset  the existing net us gaap liabilities are adjusted to the greater amount 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
mortality assumptions are generally based on the company s historical experience or standard industry tables  as applicable  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
we review our mortality assumptions annually 
generally  we do not expect our mortality trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the reserves for future policy benefits of our retirement segment  which as of december  represented of our total future policy benefit reserves  relate to our non participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products 
these reserves are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits and expenses based on assumptions as to mortality  retirement  maintenance expense  and interest rates 
reserves are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the contract is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency testing by product group using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these assumptions are greater than the existing reserves  the existing reserves are adjusted to the greater amount 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
our mortality and retirement assumptions are based on company or industry experience  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
we generally review our mortality and retirement assumptions annually 
generally  we do not expect our actual mortality or retirement trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the remaining of the reserves for future policy benefits as of december  represented reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products in our individual annuities segment and group life and disability  and long term care benefits in our group insurance segment 
certain of the optional living benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives  with fair values calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature 
for additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features  see valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities valuation of variable annuity optional living benefit features 
unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of billion as of december  is reported as a component of future policy benefits and relates primarily to the group long term disability products of our group insurance segment 
this liability represents our estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred  but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date 
we do not establish loss liabilities until a loss has occurred 
as prescribed by us gaap  our liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses 
expected future claims payments are estimated using assumed mortality and claim termination factors and an assumed interest rate 
the mortality and claim termination factors are based on standard industry tables and the company s historical experience 
our interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns 
of these assumptions  our claim termination assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of liability 
we review our claim termination assumptions compared to actual terminations annually 
these studies review actual claim termination experience over a number of years with more weight placed on the actual experience in the more recent years 
if actual experience results in a materially different assumption  we adjust our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses accordingly with a charge or credit to current period earnings 
deferred policy acquisition costs we capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts 
these costs primarily include commissions  costs of policy issuance and underwriting  and variable field office expenses 
we amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  over the expected lives of the contracts  based on the level and timing of gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums  depending on the type of contract 
as of december   dac in our financial services businesses was billion and dac in our closed block business was billion 
dac associated with the traditional participating products of our closed block business is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to gross margins 
gross margins consider premiums  investment returns  benefit claims  costs for policy administration  changes in reserves  and dividends to policyholders 
we evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins 
we also ensure the recoverability of the dac balance at the end of each reporting period 
many of the factors that affect gross margins are included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders 
since the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization  dac adjustments generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations 
however  if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense  changes in gross margins and dac amortization could result in greater volatility in our results of operations 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million 
dac associated with the non participating whole life and term life policies of our individual life segment and the non participating whole life  term life  endowment and health policies of our international insurance segment is amortized in proportion to gross premiums 
we evaluate the recoverability of our dac related to these policies as part of our premium deficiency testing 
if a premium deficiency exists  we reduce dac by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings 
if the deficiency is more than the dac balance  we then increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess  by means of a charge to current period earnings 
generally  we do not expect significant deterioration in future experience  and therefore do not expect significant writedowns to the related dac 
dac associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life and international insurance segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our individual annuities and international insurance segments is amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to gross profits 
in calculating gross profits  we consider mortality  persistency  and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts and the cost of contract minimum guarantees net of  where applicable  the impact of any capital markets hedging activities related to these guarantees 
we regularly evaluate and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of our actual gross profits and changes in our assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits 
adjustments to the dac balance include our quarterly adjustments for current period experience and market performance related adjustments  as discussed below  and the impact of the annual reviews of our estimate of total gross profits 
we also perform recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure the dac balance does not exceed the present value of total estimated gross profits 
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the cumulative impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period 
total estimated gross profits include both actual experience and estimates of gross profits for future periods 
to the extent each period s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period  the assumed level of total gross profits may change 
in these cases  we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods costs  referred to as an adjustment for current period experience 
for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment  a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins 
as a result  our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions 
our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on company experience 
we review and update our mortality assumptions annually 
updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment 
for the variable and universal life policies in our international insurance segment  mortality assumptions impact to a lesser extent our estimates of future gross profits due to differences in policyholder demographics  the overall age of this block of business  the amount of mortality margins and our actual mortality experience 
the dac balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment as of december  was billion 
the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that dac balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required  assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by 
while the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future mortality assumptions  it is a near term  reasonably likely hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change 
this information considers only the effect of changes in our mortality assumptions and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency  future rate of return  or expenses included in our evaluation of dac  and does not reflect changes in reserves  such as the unearned revenue reserve  which would partially offset the adjustments to the dac balance reflected below 
december  increase reduction in dac in millions decrease in future mortality by increase in future mortality by for a discussion of dac adjustments related to our individual life segment for the years ended december   and  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us individual life and group insurance division individual life 
for variable annuity contracts  dac is more sensitive to the effects of changes in our estimates of gross profits due primarily to the significant portion of our gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options  and the shorter average life of the contracts 
this rate of return influences the fees we earn  costs we incur associated with minimum death benefit and other contractual guarantees specific to our variable annuity contracts  as well as other sources of profit 
this is also true  to a lesser degree  for our variable life policies 
the future rate of return assumptions used in evaluating dac for our domestic variable annuity and variable life insurance products are derived using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
if the projected future rate of return over the four year period is greater than our maximum future rate of return  we use our maximum future rate of return 
in light of market conditions  we have determined that adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and any corresponding changes to the projected future rate of return assumptions for our variable annuity contracts should no longer be dependent on a comparison to a statistically generated range of estimated gross profits 
instead  beginning in the fourth quarter of  the projected future rate of return and our estimate of total gross profits are updated each quarter to reflect the result of the reversion to the mean approach 
these market performance related adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits result in cumulative adjustments to prior amortization  reflecting the application of the new required rate of amortization to all prior periods gross profits 
the new required rate of amortization is also applied prospectively to future gross profits in calculating amortization in future periods 
for variable annuities products and variable life policies  as of december   our expected rate of return for the next four years across all asset types is and per annum  respectively  which are our current maximum future rates of return under the reversion to the mean approach 
included in these composite four year rates are assumptions for returns on various asset classes  including limits on implied returns on equity investments that range from to 
our long term expected rate of return across all asset types for variable annuities products and variable life policies range from to  depending on the specific block of business  and reflect  among other assumptions  an expected rate of return of per annum for equity investments 
the dac balance associated with our domestic variable annuity contracts was billion as of december  the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that dac balance relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that we would be required assuming both an increase and decrease in our future rate of return by basis points 
while the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future rate of return assumptions  it is a near term  reasonably likely hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change 
this information considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on the dac balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency  mortality  or expenses included in our evaluation of dac 
further  this information does not reflect changes in reserves  such as the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features of our variable annuity products  or the impact that changes in such reserves may have on the dac balance

in addition to dac  we also recognize assets for deferred sales inducements and valuation of business acquired  or voba 
the deferred sales inducements are recognized in our individual annuities segment and are amortized over the anticipated life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs 
for additional information about our deferred sales inducements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
voba represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired businesses  and is determined by estimating the net present value of future cash flows from the contracts in force at the date of acquisition 
we have established a voba asset primarily for our acquired traditional life  deferred annuity  defined contribution and defined benefit businesses 
voba is amortized over the effective life of the acquired contracts 
for additional information about voba including details on items included in our estimates of future cash flows for the various acquired businesses and its bases for amortization  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred sales inducements and voba are also subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the capitalized amounts do not exceed the present value of total anticipated gross profits 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december of each year and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the potential for impairment is more likely than not 
the test is performed at the reporting unit level which is equal to or one level below our operating segments 
reporting units that have goodwill subject to testing were the asset management segment  the international insurance segment s life planners business  the retirement segment s full service business  the individual annuities segment  the international investments segment excluding the global commodities group  and the prudential real estate and relocation prers business which is included within corporate and other operations 
as required by accounting guidance  the impairment testing process consists of two steps 
step requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be calculated and compared to the reporting unit s carrying value 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying value  it is concluded there is no impairment and the analysis is complete 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  step of the process is completed to determine the amount of impairment  if any 
step utilizes business combination purchase accounting guidance and requires the fair value calculation of all individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill  but including any unrecognized intangible assets 
the net fair value of assets less liabilities is then compared to the reporting unit s total fair value as calculated in step the excess of fair value over the net asset value equals the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine the reporting unit s goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the fair value of reporting units calculated in step was determined using either an earnings multiple or discounted cash flow approach 
the earnings multiple approach was the primary approach for the asset management and international insurance reporting units  the discounted cash flow approach was primarily utilized by the individual annuities  prers  and retirement reporting units  and a weighted average of both methods was utilized by the international investments reporting unit 
earnings multiples used ranged from to times earnings while discount rates ranged from to 
the range of multiples and discount rates reflect the diversity of our various businesses and the range of risks inherent in their cash flows 
the earnings multiple approach indicates the value of a business based on comparison to publicly traded comparable companies in similar lines of business 
each comparable company is analyzed based on various factors  including  but not limited to  financial risk  size  geographic diversification  profitability  adequate financial data  and an actively traded stock price 
a multiple of price to earnings is developed for the comparable companies using independent analyst s consensus estimates for each company s forecasted earnings 
the multiple is then applied to the forecasted earnings of the reporting unit to develop a value 
a control premium is then added to determine a total estimated fair value for the reporting unit 
the discounted cash flow approach calculates the value of a business by applying a discount rate reflecting the market expected weighted average rate of return to the projected future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the weighted average rate of return  or warr  represents the required rate of return on total capitalization 
it is comprised of a required rate of return on equity of a company and the current tax affected cost of debt  which are then weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt in the capital structure 
to estimate the return on equity  we applied the capital asset pricing model  or capm 
the capm is a generally accepted method for estimating an equity investor s return requirement  and hence a company s cost of equity capital 
capm is determined by beginning with the long term risk free rate of return then applying adjustments that consider the equity risk premium required for large company common stock investments as well as company specific adjustments to address volatility  small company premiums and other risks particular to a specific company 
after completion of step of the analysis  it was determined that three of our reporting units  international investments excluding the global commodities group  prers  and individual annuities  had a fair value less than its carrying value 
accordingly  step was applied and it was determined that of the goodwill within these units was impaired  resulting in charges of million in international investments  million in prers and million in individual annuities 
as such  during we recorded a total impairment charge for goodwill of million  which is included in general and administrative expenses 
in applying step  the fair value of individual assets and liabilities was determined either through use of quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar items or through internally generated calculations generally using discounted cash flow analyses with discount rates that reflected the risk inherent in the specific assets and liabilities 
these impairments reflect the continued deterioration of financial conditions and the impact of this deterioration on expected future earnings of these businesses  including for our individual annuities reporting unit equity market declines and resulting additional market depreciation within separate account assets and corresponding decreases in our anticipated future fee income  for our international investments reporting unit significant market deterioration resulting in both a reduction in value and an outflow of assets under management which contributed to lower asset management fees earned in the fourth quarter and expected in future periods and for our prers reporting unit further deterioration of the us housing market  including the number of transactions and the national average home sale price which both declined in the fourth quarter  and the impact of this decline on future anticipated revenues of this business 
of the reporting units that passed step  the asset management and international insurance life planner businesses had estimated fair values that exceeded their december  carrying values by and  respectively 
the fair value of the retirement full service business  which was calculated based upon application of the discounted cash flow approach utilizing a discount rate of  exceeded the carrying value by 
a decline in forecasted cashflows of  or an increase in the discount rate above  could result in the retirement business failing step and requiring a step assessment 
as of december   we had a remaining goodwill balance of million  including million related to our retirement reporting unit and million related to our asset management reporting unit 
further market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses  or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses  could result in additional goodwill impairments  resulting in a charge to income 
as indicated above  the earnings multiple approach indicates the value of a business based on comparison to publicly traded comparable companies in similar lines of business 
however  given the absence of pure play comparable companies and the difficulty in identifying businesses which share similar risk characteristics of our reporting unit s operations  it was determined that in most cases  using the discounted cash flows approach would yield the best estimate of fair value of our reporting units 
in order to confirm the reasonableness of all the fair values calculated  a reconciliation of the individual reporting unit s fair values to the market capitalization of the company was performed 
the total calculated fair value of all reporting units and other operations was compared to the market capitalization as indicated by the company stock price and number of shares outstanding at december  the difference reflected a control premium which we believe is within a range of reasonableness 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements 
our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount interest rate  an expected rate of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs 
of these assumptions  our expected rate of return assumptions  and to a lesser extent our discount rate assumptions  have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans 
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon asset classes and a building block approach that includes inflation  real return  a term premium  an equity risk premium  as applicable  a credit spread  as applicable  and capital appreciation  as well as active management  expenses and the effect of rebalancing 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans

given the amount of plan assets as of september   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below 
the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed long term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year  without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long term rate of return

in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
taxes on income our effective tax rate is based on income  non taxable and non deductible items  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times from the items reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than the actual rate applied on the tax return 
some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as valuation of insurance reserves 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized in our financial statements 
the application of us gaap requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
considerable judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  and if so  the amount of such valuation allowance 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we consider many factors  including the nature of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  whether they are ordinary or capital  in which tax jurisdictions they were generated and the timing of their reversal  taxable income in prior carryback years as well as projected taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  the length of time that carryovers can be utilized in the various taxing jurisdictions  any unique tax rules that would impact the utilization of the deferred tax assets  and any tax planning strategies that we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  will be realized 
our accounting represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
certain changes or future events  such as changes in tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings and completion of tax audits could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate 
for example  the dividends received deduction  or drd  reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense and the expected amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 
the us treasury department and the internal revenue service  or irs  intend to address through regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the drd related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts 
a change in the drd  including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through regulations or legislation  could increase our actual tax expense and reduce our consolidated net income 
on january   we adopted fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
fin no 
is a two step process  the first step being recognition 
we determine whether it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
the second step is measurement 
we measure the tax position as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
this measurement considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement using the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percent of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our consolidated loss from continuing operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures in of million 
our liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties which relate to tax years still subject to review by the irs or other taxing authorities 
audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed 
generally  for tax years which produce net operating losses  capital losses or tax credit carryforwards  or tax attributes  the statute of limitations does not close  to the extent of these tax attributes  until the expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year in which they are fully utilized 
the completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to our liability for income taxes 
the statute of limitations for the and us federal tax years is set to expire in it is reasonably possible that the total net amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase anywhere from to million within the next months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations as well as cash receipts on settlement of the irs examination 
us federal tax years through are still open for irs examination 
on january   the irs officially closed the audit of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the to periods 
the statute of limitations has closed for these tax years  however  there were tax attributes which were utilized in subsequent tax years for which the statute of limitations remains open 
in august  the irs issued revenue ruling  which included  among other items  guidance on the methodology to be followed in calculating the drd related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts 
in september  the irs released revenue ruling revenue ruling suspends revenue ruling and informs taxpayers that the us treasury department and the irs intend to address through new regulations the issues considered in revenue ruling  including the methodology to be followed in determining the drd related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts 
in december  the irs completed all fieldwork with regards to its examination of the consolidated us federal income tax returns for tax years and the final report was initially submitted to the joint committee on taxation for their review in april the final report was resubmitted in march and again in april the joint committee returned the report to the irs for additional review of an industry issue regarding the methodology for calculating the drd related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts 
the irs completed its review of the issue and proposed an adjustment with respect to the calculation of the drd 
in order to expedite receipt of an income tax refund related to the and years  we have agreed to such adjustment 
nevertheless  we believe that our return position is technically correct 
therefore  we intend to file a protective refund claim to recover the taxes associated with the agreed upon adjustment and to pursue such other actions as appropriate 
the report  with the adjustment  was submitted to the joint committee on taxation in october we were advised on january  that the joint committee completed its consideration of the report and has taken no exception to the conclusions reached by the irs 
accordingly  the final report was processed and a refund was received 
the statute of limitations for these years will close on december  in january  the irs began an examination of the consolidated us federal income tax years through for the consolidated us federal income tax years and  we participated in the irs s compliance assurance program  or cap 
under cap  the irs assigns an examination team to review completed transactions contemporaneously during the and tax years in order to reach agreement with us on how they should be reported in the tax return 
if disagreements arise  accelerated resolutions programs are available to resolve the disagreements in a timely manner before the tax return is filed 
it is management s expectation this program will shorten the time period between the filing of our federal income tax return and the irs s completion of its examination of the return 
our affiliates in japan file separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority 
the general statute of limitations is years from when the return is filed 
during  the tokyo regional taxation bureau concluded a routine tax audit of the tax returns of gibraltar life insurance company  ltd

reserves for contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events 
under us gaap  reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated 
an example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with an unresolved legal matter 
the initial reserve reflects management s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when the matter is brought to closure

income loss from continuing operations attributable to the financial services businesses decreased billion  from income of billion in to a loss of billion in  reflecting the impact of unfavorable market conditions on the results of our segments and investment portfolio 
the decrease reflects pre tax net investment losses in  within both our general account and proprietary investments  and impairments in related to goodwill and declines in value of investments in certain operating joint ventures 
in addition  the decrease reflects reserve increases for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs reflecting an update of actuarial assumptions primarily due to the impact of market conditions

segment measures in managing our business  we analyze operating performance separately for our financial services businesses and our closed block business 
for the financial services businesses  we analyze our segments operating performance using adjusted operating income 
results of the closed block business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted operating income does not equate to income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures or net income as determined in accordance with us gaap but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources  and consistent with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  is our measure of segment performance 
adjusted operating income is calculated for the segments of the financial services businesses by adjusting each segment s income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures for the following items realized investment gains losses  net  except as indicated below  and related charges and adjustments  net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes  the contribution to income loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited that do not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment under us gaap  and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures 
the items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations 
adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with us gaap  and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies 
however  we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the financial services businesses 
adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains losses  net  except as indicated below  and related charges and adjustments 
a significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit related and interest rate related gains and losses from sales of securities 
impairments and losses from sales of credit impaired securities  the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles  can vary considerably across periods 
the timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses  such as interest rate related gains or losses  is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities  as well as our tax profile 
trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions 
similarly  adjusted operating income excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes  because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to the contractholders 
adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested businesses because they are not relevant to understanding our ongoing operating results 
the contributions to income loss of wind down businesses that we have not divested remain in adjusted operating income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the presentation of segment results 
as noted above  certain realized investment gains losses  net  are included in adjusted operating income 
we include in adjusted operating income the portion of our realized investment gains and losses on derivatives that arise from the termination of contracts used to hedge our foreign currency earnings in the same period that the expected earnings emerge 
similarly  we include in adjusted operating income the portion of our realized investment gains and losses on derivatives that represent current period yield adjustments 
the realized investment gains or losses from products that are free standing derivatives  or contain embedded derivatives  along with the realized investment gains or losses from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an economic hedging program related to the risk of these products  are included in adjusted operating income 
adjusted operating income also includes those realized investment gains and losses that represent profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors

on june   we acquired the variable annuity business of the allstate corporation  or allstate  through a reinsurance transaction for million of total consideration  consisting primarily of a million ceding commission 
our initial investment in the business was approximately million  consisting of the total consideration  offset by the related tax benefits and an additional contribution of million to meet regulatory capital requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition 
adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income decreased billion  from million in to a loss of billion in adjusted operating income for included charges of billion  reflecting the impact of the annual reviews of  and market performance adjustment to  the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
the total charge of billion in included million of charges from the annual reviews  which were completed in the third quarter of  and million of charges relating to additional market performance adjustments in the fourth quarter of adjusted operating income for included million of benefits from the annual reviews 
the charges from the annual reviews of million in included million relating to reserve increases for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and million related to increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
the charge relating to increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs primarily reflects the impact on gross profits of market value decreases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products 
the reserve increases for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products also reflects this impact  as well as increased cost of expected income and death benefit claims due to lower expected lapse rates for policies where the current policyholder account value is below the guaranteed minimum death benefit 
adjusted operating income for included million of benefits from the annual reviews  reflecting market value increases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products  and decreased cost of actual and expected death claims  partially offset by the impact of model refinements and higher expected lapse rates for the variable annuity business acquired from allstate 
as discussed above  results for also include million of charges associated with market performance related adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance in the fourth quarter of in light of recent market conditions  beginning in the fourth quarter of we determined that adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and any corresponding changes to the future rate of return assumptions should no longer be dependent on a comparison to a statistically generated range of estimated gross profits 
instead  for purposes of evaluating deferred policy acquisition and other costs and the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products  total estimated gross profits are updated for these items each quarter 
market value declines in the fourth quarter of decreased our estimates of total gross profits by establishing a new  lower starting point for the variable annuity account values used in estimating gross profits for future periods 
the decrease in our estimate of total gross profits results in a higher required rate of amortization  which is applied to all prior periods gross profits 
the resulting cumulative adjustment to prior amortization is recognized in the current period 
in addition  the higher rate of amortization will also be applied to future gross profits in calculating amortization in future periods which  all else being equal  will result in lower net profits in future periods 
we continue to derive our future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
however  beginning in the second half of  the projected future rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach for most contract groups was greater than  our current maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business 
in those cases we utilized the maximum future rate of return over the four year period  thereby limiting the impact of the reversion to the mean  and further decreasing our estimate of total gross profits 
further or continued market declines could result in additional market depreciation within our separate account assets and corresponding decreases in our gross profits  as well as additional adjustments to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and the costs relating to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
given that the estimates of future gross profits for most contract groups are already based upon our maximum future rate of return assumption as discussed above  all else being equal  further market movements could have a greater impact on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and the costs relating to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products  in comparison to prior periods 
the above adjustment for market performance included million relating to increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs and million relating to reserve increases for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
included within the million of increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs is a million loss recognition charge to further reduce the balance of valuation of business acquired  or voba  related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from allstate 
the additional charge was required as the voba balance for those contracts otherwise would have been in excess of the present value of estimated future gross profits 
since the voba balance for the allstate contracts now equals the present value of estimated future gross profits  we expect gross profits for these contracts in future periods will be essentially offset by the related voba amortization 
absent the effect of the annual reviews and market performance adjustments discussed above  adjusted operating income for decreased million from contributing to this decrease is a million unfavorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features 
the primary risk exposures of these benefit features relate to actual deviations from  or changes to  the assumptions used in their original pricing  including equity market returns  interest rates  market volatility  timing of annuitization and withdrawals  contract lapses and contractholder mortality 
together with certain product design elements  our capital markets hedging program is designed to limit our exposure to the equity market  interest rate  and market volatility risk inherent in these products  as part of our overall risk management strategy 
the unfavorable variance in our hedging results reflects a charge of million in compared to a benefit of million in  and was largely due to unfavorable basis risk  primarily reflecting the underperformance of the underlying separate account funds relative to the performance of the market indices we utilized as a basis for developing our hedging strategy  driven by financial market conditions in the charge in includes an million benefit for an update of the assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives  primarily relating to an update of implied volatility ratios to better match the actual equity indices referenced 
given the sensitivity of the fair value of both the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions to financial market conditions  the variance related to the mark to market of these items for a given period will be largely dependent on the financial market conditions throughout the period 
for additional information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with our living benefit features  see valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities valuation of variable annuity optional living benefit features 
also contributing to the decrease in adjusted operating income in was a decrease in fee income  driven by lower average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts 
the declines in separate account assets were due to market depreciation and transfers of balances to a fixed rate general account option 
the transfer of balances to our general account relates to an automatic rebalancing element in some of our living benefit features  which  as part of the overall product design  transferred approximately billion of investments in  out of the separate accounts and into our general account due to equity market declines 
higher average annuity account values invested in our general account resulting from these transfers also led to improved investment results  which partially offset the decrease in fee income 
also serving as a partial offset to the decrease in adjusted operating income in was a decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other costs  absent the effect of the annual reviews and market performance adjustments discussed above 
the decrease primarily reflects the impact on gross profits of the unfavorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features and the decrease in fee income  partially offset by the quarterly adjustments for current period experience  as explained below 
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the cumulative impact of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period  as well as an update for current and future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
total estimated gross profits  including actual experience and estimates for future periods  are used as the basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
in addition  total estimated revenues and guaranteed benefit claims  which are components of total gross profits  are used for establishing the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
to the extent each period s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period  the assumed level of total gross profits may change  and a cumulative adjustment to previous periods costs  referred to as an adjustment for current period experience  may be required 
adjusted operating income for includes charges of million relating to these quarterly adjustments  due to less favorable than expected experience  while includes benefits of million due to better than expected experience 
the adjustments for deferred policy acquisition and other costs totaled million in and resulted from less favorable than expected gross profits  due primarily to lower than expected fee income and the unfavorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features 
in addition to these drivers  the adjustments for the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products in  which totaled million  also reflected higher actual contract guarantee claims costs in  primarily driven by financial market conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  we impaired the entire million of goodwill related to our acquisition of the variable annuity business of allstate 
this impairment is reflective of continued deterioration of financial market conditions  which resulted in additional market depreciation within our separate account assets and corresponding decreases in our fee income and overall expected future earnings for our individual annuities business 
see accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates goodwill for further discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to determine the goodwill impairment 
to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million  from million in to million in results for both periods include the impact of annual reviews of our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs and the reserve for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
adjusted operating income for included a million benefit from this annual review  reflecting market value increases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products  and decreased cost of actual and expected death claims  partially offset by the impact of model refinements and higher expected lapse rates for the variable annuity business acquired from allstate 
adjusted operating income for included a million benefit from the annual review  primarily reflecting improved net interest spread from increased investment yields 
absent the effect of the annual reviews discussed above  adjusted operating income for increased million from adjusted operating income from the variable annuity business acquired from allstate  excluding the impact of the annual review discussed above  increased million  reflecting a million contribution for  compared to million for  which reflects results only for the initial seven months of operations from the date of acquisition 
the remainder of the increase came primarily from higher fee income driven by higher average asset balances from market appreciation and positive net asset flows in our variable annuity account values 
also contributing to the increase was a million favorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features  net of amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
partially offsetting these items was an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs reflecting increased gross profits in  and an increase in general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  reflecting higher distribution and asset management costs associated with growth in variable annuity account values  as well as growth of the business 
in addition  interest expense increased driven by higher borrowings related to growth of the business  and net investment income  net of interest credited to policyholders account balances  decreased primarily as a result of declining annuity account values invested in our general account  reflecting our emphasis on sales of variable annuities together with asset allocation requirements associated with the living benefit features we offer in our variable annuity products 
the contribution of the acquired allstate business to adjusted operating income for  excluding the impact of the annual review discussed above  consists of revenues of million and benefits and expenses of million

also on this basis  interest credited to policyholders account balances increased million primarily reflecting higher average annuity account values invested in our general account resulting from transfers relating to an automatic rebalancing element in some of our living benefit features 
in addition  general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  for includes the million goodwill impairment 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  absent the effect of the annual reviews and market performance adjustments discussed above  primarily reflecting the impact on gross profits of the unfavorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with some of our living benefit features and the decrease in fee income  partially offset by the quarterly adjustments for current period experience relating to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs

this action seeks  among other relief  restitution of certain losses experienced by plan clients attributable to certain investment funds managed by ssga as to which we believe ssga employed investment strategies and practices that were misrepresented by ssga and failed to exercise the standard of care of a prudent investment manager 
in order to protect the interests of the affected plans and their participants while we pursue these remedies  we have made payments to affected plan clients that authorize us to proceed on their behalf 
in addition  adjusted operating income for includes a million benefit from a reduction in the amortization of valuation of business acquired due to a cumulative adjustment relating to the calculation of actual and expected gross profits 
excluding the items discussed above  adjusted operating income for decreased million compared to  reflecting lower adjusted operating income in our full service business  partially offset by improved results for our institutional investment products business 
the decrease relating to the full service business was primarily attributable to higher general and administrative expenses  driven by expenses incurred to expand our product and service capabilities and to support several large client sales in  and lower asset management fees  driven by a decrease in average full service fee based retirement account values primarily resulting from equity market depreciation 
also contributing to the decrease in the full service business was a million unfavorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits associated with certain defined contribution accounts 
this unfavorable variance includes the impact of equity markets on these benefit features  prior to the implementation of our hedging of this equity market risk during the fourth quarter of in addition  adjusted operating income for includes an million loss relating to the acquired retirement business of uboc 
results from this acquisition include costs related to an interim service agreement with uboc  which covered the integration period  as well as million of transition costs 
improved results in our institutional investment products business were driven by a greater benefit from reserve refinements of million  primarily reflecting updates of client census data on our group annuity blocks of business  as well as more favorable case experience related to our group annuity blocks of business

excluding this charge  adjusted operating income for increased million compared to  reflecting improved results from both our full service and institutional investment products businesses 
the full service business benefited primarily from higher fees  driven by increases in full service retirement account values related primarily to market appreciation 
contributing to the increase to a lesser extent was the lack of transition expenses in  as included million of transition expenses related to the completion of the integration of the retirement business acquired from cigna 
partially offsetting these items within the full service business was an increase in general and administrative expenses driven by expenses incurred to expand our product and service capabilities 
in addition  adjusted operating income for included a benefit from the disposition of real estate within an investment joint venture 
in our institutional investment products business  a greater contribution from investment results  primarily due to a larger base of invested assets and higher portfolio yields  and improved case experience were partially offset by a decrease in the level of mortgage prepayment income and a lower benefit from reserve refinements reflecting updates of client census data on a group annuity block of business 
contributing to the higher portfolio yields in is the benefit from the sale of lower yielding bonds and reinvestment of proceeds at higher available interest rates  which primarily occurred in the first half of the realized investment losses generated from these sales are excluded from adjusted operating income

adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income decreased million  from million in to million in the decrease in adjusted operating income is largely attributable to unfavorable results from the segment s proprietary investing business 
results of the segment s proprietary investing business decreased million  primarily due to a decline in the value of fixed income investments of million  including impairments on collateralized debt obligations of million 
the decrease in fixed income investments includes a decline of million in a fixed income fund  from income of million in  to a loss of million in in the fourth quarter of  two entities within the asset management segment made a request to redeem their entire investment from this fixed income fund  which aggregate investments were million at december  the fixed income fund has suspended redemptions

adjusted operating income decreased million  from million in to million in adjusted operating income for includes a million benefit from a net reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other costs due to an increased estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves  based on an annual review  primarily reflecting improved future mortality expectations based on improvements in recent mortality experience on our in force business  compared to a similar benefit for million from the annual review in results for also include a million benefit from compensation received based on multi year profitability of third party products we distribute  while results for include a similar benefit amounting to million 
these compensation arrangements are subject to renegotiation periodically which will affect the amount of additional compensation we are eligible to receive 
the largest of these arrangements has been renegotiated and the profit opportunities will be significantly reduced in and beyond 
absent the effect of these items  adjusted operating income for decreased million from the prior year 
on this basis  the decrease in adjusted operating income is primarily due to a net increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  primarily reflecting the impact of unfavorable equity markets on both separate account fund performance  including the impact of a corresponding change to the future rate of return assumptions  and variable product policy persistency 
also contributing to the decrease in adjusted operating income in was a decrease in asset based fees due to lower separate account asset balances reflecting the impact of the unfavorable equity markets  as well as losses on separate account fund liquidations associated with variable policy lapses and surrenders 
these decreases were partially offset by higher product margins from growth in term and universal life insurance in force and improved mortality experience  net of reinsurance  compared to the prior year 
due to policyholder options under some of the variable contracts  lapses may occur on a quarter lag with the market risk during this lag being borne by the company 
consequently  due to the continued unfavorable equity markets in the fourth quarter of  the variable policy lapses are expected to continue to negatively impact results of the first quarter of the net increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves includes the impact of actual market performance on both actual profits and estimated future gross profits  used as the basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs 
we continue to derive our future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
however  beginning in the fourth quarter of  the projected future rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach was greater than  our current maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business 
as a result  we utilized the maximum future rate of return over the four year period  thereby limiting the impact of the reversion to the mean  and further decreasing our estimate of total gross profits

sales results the following table sets forth the group insurance segment s annualized new business premiums for the periods indicated 
in managing our group insurance business  we analyze annualized new business premiums  which do not correspond to revenues under us gaap  because annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the business unit  while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income  in addition to current sales

total annualized new business premiums decreased million from million in to million in this decrease is primarily due to lower large case sales in the group life business during  reflective of highly competitive pricing in the marketplace and the pricing discipline we apply in writing business 
partially offsetting this decrease were higher large case and middle market sales in the group disability business during international insurance and investments division impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings as a us based company with significant business operations outside the us  we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will reduce our us dollar equivalent earnings 
the operations of our international insurance and international investments segments are subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect their us dollar results from period to period even if results on a local currency basis are relatively constant 
as discussed further below  we enter into forward currency derivative contracts  as well as dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments  as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a portion of our prospective non us dollar denominated earnings streams  thereby reducing volatility from unfavorable and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 
forward currency hedging program the financial results of our international insurance segment and international investments segment  excluding the global commodities group  for all periods presented reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement with corporate and other operations pursuant to which the segments non us dollar denominated earnings in all countries are translated at fixed currency exchange rates 
the fixed rates are determined in connection with a currency income hedging program designed to mitigate the risk that unfavorable exchange rate changes will reduce the segments us dollar equivalent earnings 
pursuant to this program  corporate and other operations executes forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the hedged currency in exchange for us dollars at specified exchange rates 
the maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods in which the identified non us dollar denominated earnings are expected to be generated 
this program is primarily associated with the international insurance segment s businesses in japan  korea and taiwan and the international investments segment s businesses in korea and europe 
the intercompany arrangement with corporate and other operations increased decreased revenues and adjusted operating income of each segment as follows for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions impact on revenues and adjusted operating income international insurance international investments total international insurance and investments division results of corporate and other operations include any differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segments and the gains or losses recorded from the forward currency contracts that settled during the period 
the consolidated net impact of this program recorded within the corporate and other operations were gains of million  gains of million and a loss of million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the notional amount of these forward currency contracts was billion as of both december  and december   of which billion and billion as of december  and december   respectively  related to our japanese insurance operations 
dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments in addition  our japanese insurance operations also hold dual currency investments in the form of fixed maturities and loans 
the principal of these dual currency investments are yen denominated while the related interest income is us dollar denominated 
these investments are the economic equivalent of exchanging what would otherwise be fixed streams of yen denominated interest income for fixed streams of us dollar interest income 
our japanese insurance operations also hold investments in yen denominated investments that have been coupled with cross currency coupon swap agreements  creating synthetic dual currency investments 
the yen us dollar exchange rate is effectively fixed  as we are obligated in future periods to exchange fixed amounts of japanese yen interest payments generated by the yen denominated investments for us dollars at the us dollar exchange rates specified by the cross currency coupon swap agreements 
as of december  and december   the notional amount of these investments was billion  or billion  and billion  or billion  respectively  based upon the foreign currency exchange rates applicable at the time these investments were acquired 
for the years ended december   and  the weighted average yield generated by these investments was  and  respectively 
presented below is the fair value of these instruments as reflected on our balance sheet for the periods presented

year interest component of dual currency investments cross currency coupon swap element of synthetic dual currency investments yen denominated earnings subject to these investments weighted average exchange rate per us dollar in billions yen per total yen amounts are imputed from the contractual us dollar denominated interest cash flows 
the table above does not reflect the forward currency income hedging program discussed above 
in establishing the level of yen denominated earnings that will be hedged through the forward currency income hedging program we take into account the anticipated level of us dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments  as well as the anticipated level of us dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by us dollar denominated products and investments  which are discussed in greater detail below 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on equity hedges of us gaap equity and available economic capital we also seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will reduce our us dollar equivalent equity in foreign subsidiaries through various hedging strategies 
we are in the process of developing an economic capital framework  which includes available economic capital  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources prudential financial economic capital  and as we further develop this framework  or as other events occur  we may alter this strategy 
available economic capital represents the excess of the fair value of assets over the fair value of liabilities for the current in force block of business 
in our japanese insurance operations we currently seek to hedge a portion of estimated available economic capital and other measures of value  including the amount attributable to the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations  which totaled billion as of december  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income components of stockholders equity and certain other adjustments 
we hedge the estimated available economic capital in our japanese insurance operations through a variety of instruments  including us dollar denominated investments financed with yen denominated liabilities and equity  yen denominated debt and us dollar denominated debt that has been swapped to yen 
in certain of our other foreign insurance operations  the us gaap equity exposure is mitigated by entering into forward currency contracts that generally qualify for hedge accounting treatment  and by holding us dollar denominated investments 
as of december   the aggregate amount of the instruments serving as hedges of our estimated available economic capital in our japanese insurance operations amounted to billion  an increase of billion from december  the instruments were principally comprised of available for sale us dollar denominated investments with an amortized cost of billion and held to maturity us dollar denominated investments with an amortized cost of billion  as well as billion of net yen denominated debt and us dollar denominated debt that has been swapped to yen 
the effects of the us dollar denominated debt that has been swapped to yen are reported in corporate other operations 
these amounts do not reflect the forward currency income hedging program or dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments discussed above 
the available for sale investments under us gaap are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with unrealized changes in fair value except as described below for impairments  including those from changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements  recorded as unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
changes in the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations due to foreign currency exchange rate movements are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a currency translation adjustment 
the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations is partially offset by foreign currency exchange related changes in designated yen denominated debt and other hedging instruments within the currency translation adjustment account 
to a larger degree the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations is offset by the related changes in fair value due to foreign currency exchange rate movements of the portion of the available for sale investments that supports our japanese insurance operations us gaap equity  hence creating a natural equity hedge 
for us dollar denominated investments that support the portion of estimated available economic capital above our us gaap equity there is no offsetting impact to equity 
the investments designated as held to maturity under us gaap are recorded at amortized cost on the balance sheet  but are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements with the related change in value recorded within asset management fees and other income 
the remeasurement related to the change in value for foreign currency exchange rate movements for these investments is excluded from adjusted operating income  as part of our application of the hedge of available economic capital 
the us dollar denominated investments that hedge a portion of our estimated available economic capital in our japanese insurance operations pay a coupon  which is reflected within net investment income  and  therefore  included in adjusted operating income  which is approximately to basis points greater than what a similar yen based investment would pay 
the incremental impact of this higher yield will vary over time  and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investment  as well as interest rate environments in the us and japan at the time of the investment 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments investment results for a discussion of the investment yields generated by our japanese insurance operations 
because these us dollar denominated investments are recorded on the books of yen based entities  foreign currency exchange movements will impact their value 
to the extent the value of the yen strengthens as compared to the us dollar  the value of these us dollar denominated investments will decrease as a result of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates 
upon the ultimate sale or maturity of the us dollar denominated investments  any realized change in value related to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will be included in realized gains losses  net within the income statement and  excluded from adjusted operating income 
similarly  any impairment recognized on these investments  including those for an other than temporary decline in value that may include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  will be included in realized gains losses  net within the income statement  and  as such  excluded from adjusted operating income 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities for a discussion of our policies regarding impairments 
during the first quarter of  we began incorporating the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the remaining us dollar denominated net asset position of our japanese insurance operations  which primarily relates to accrued investment income  as part of our overall application of the hedge of available economic capital 
these us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  as they are non yen denominated items on the books of yen based entities  and the related change in value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
as these us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are included in the determination of the japanese insurance operations level of available economic capital  we exclude all remeasurement related to these items from adjusted operating income 
in addition  as of december  and december   our international insurance operations also had billion and billion  respectively  of foreign currency exposure from us dollar liabilities for us dollar denominated products issued by these operations 
a portion of these liabilities are coinsured to our us domiciled insurance operations and supported by us dollar denominated assets 
for the us dollar liabilities retained in japan  our japanese operations hold us dollar denominated investments  including a significant portion that are designated as available for sale  and other related us dollar denominated net assets  primarily accrued investment income  to support these products 
the change in value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements  or remeasurement  of the related us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with these products is excluded from adjusted operating income 
international insurance the results of our international insurance operations are translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates  inclusive of the effects of the intercompany arrangement discussed above 
to provide a better understanding of operating performance within the international insurance segment  where indicated below  we have analyzed our results of operations excluding the effect of the year over year change in foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations were derived by translating foreign currencies to us dollars at uniform exchange rates for all periods presented  including  for constant dollar information discussed below  japanese yen at a rate of yen per us dollar  korean won at a rate of won per us dollar 
in addition  for constant dollar information discussed below  activity denominated in us dollars is reported based on the amounts as transacted in us dollars 
annualized new business premiums presented on a constant exchange rate basis in the sales results section below reflect translation based on these same uniform exchange rates

gibraltar life s adjusted operating income increased million  from million in to million in  including a million favorable impact of currency fluctuations 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  adjusted operating income for gibraltar life increased million primarily reflecting improved investment income margins 
the improvement in investment income margins reflects the benefit of various investment portfolio strategies  including duration lengthening in our japanese yen investments  increased credit exposure and increased utilization of us dollar based investments 
in addition  the continued growth of our us dollar denominated fixed annuity product contributed to the improvement in investment income margins 
investment income margins also benefited million in from investment income associated with a single investment joint venture  reflecting the sale of real estate within the venture 
partially offsetting these benefits to investment income margins was the benefit in of million from an investment joint venture transaction 
the increase in adjusted operating income also reflects a million charge recognized in for refinements in policy liabilities 
revenues to annual comparison 
revenues  as shown in the table above under operating results  increased million  from billion in to billion in  including a net favorable impact of million relating to currency fluctuations 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  revenues increased million  from billion in to billion in revenues from our life planner operations increased million  from billion in to billion in  including a net favorable impact of currency fluctuations of million 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  revenues increased million from to  primarily due to an increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income of million  from billion in to billion in premiums and policy charges and fee income from our japanese life planner operation increased million  from billion in to billion in premiums and policy charges and fee income from our korean operation increased million  from billion in to billion in the increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income in both operations was primarily the result of growth in business in force from new sales and strong persistency 
net investment income also increased million  from million in to million in  due to higher portfolio yields from various investment portfolio strategies  including duration lengthening and increased exposure to corporate securities  and asset growth 
due to the long term nature of many of the products we sell in japan  we have historically sought to add duration exposure to our japanese investment portfolio by employing various strategies  including investing in longer term securities or  due to the difficulty in finding appropriate securities with the same long duration  by entering into long duration floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
these strategies better support the characteristics of our long dated product liabilities  and have resulted in higher portfolio yields 
based on an evaluation of recent market conditions  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into  we have terminated or offset many of these interest rate swaps in consideration of  among other things  the interest rate environment 
these actions will result in lower portfolio yields in our japanese life planner operations in we continue to manage the interest rate risk profile of our businesses in the context of market conditions and relative opportunities  and we expect to resume implementing strategies to lengthen the duration of our japanese investment portfolio as our assessment of market conditions changes 
as we do so  the impact to our portfolio yields upon the resumption of these strategies will depend on the then current interest rate environment 
revenues from gibraltar life increased million  from billion in to billion in  including a favorable impact from currency fluctuations of million 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  revenues for gibraltar life increased million  from billion in to billion in this increase reflects a million increase in net investment income  from million in to million in  driven by the continued growth of our us dollar denominated annuity product  as well as higher portfolio yields from various investment portfolio strategies including increased exposure to corporate securities  increased utilization of us dollar denominated investments and duration lengthening 
premiums decreased million from billion in to billion in  driven primarily by a decrease in single pay premiums and lower renewal premiums reflecting the attrition of existing business 
our renewal premiums have declined as the market has continued to transition from traditional products  on which we record premiums  to newer products such as those with a retirement and savings objective  for which customer funds received are recorded as deposits

the increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income in both operations was primarily the result of new sales and strong persistency 
net investment income also increased million  from million in to million in  due to asset growth and higher investment yields reflecting duration lengthening of our japanese yen investment portfolio and increased utilization of us dollar based investments 
revenues from gibraltar life declined million  from billion in to billion in  including an unfavorable impact from currency fluctuations of million 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  revenues increased million  from billion in to billion in premiums decreased million  from billion in to billion in  as premiums in benefited million from additional face amounts of insurance issued pursuant to a special dividend arrangement established as part of gibraltar life s reorganization for which includes no such benefit 
substantially all of these premiums recognized pursuant to the special dividend arrangement were offset by a corresponding charge to increase reserves for the affected policies 
also reflected in premiums are higher sales of single premium contracts and an increase in first year premium  mostly offset by a decrease in renewal premiums reflecting the expected attrition of older business 
our premiums have declined as the market has continued to transition from traditional products  on which we record premiums  to products with a retirement and savings objective  for which customer funds received are recorded as deposits 
more than offsetting the decrease in premium was a million increase in net investment income  from million in to million in  due to improved investment income margins  as discussed above 
benefits and expenses to annual comparison 
benefits and expenses  as shown in the table above under operating results  increased million  from billion in to billion in  including a net unfavorable impact of million related to currency fluctuations

excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  benefits and expenses increased million  from billion in to billion in benefits and expenses of our japanese life planner operations increased million  from billion in to billion in benefits and expenses from our korean operation increased million  from billion in to billion in the increase in benefits and expenses in both operations reflects an increase in policyholder benefits  including changes in reserves  which was driven by the growth in business in force 
gibraltar life s benefits and expenses increased million  from billion in to billion in  including a million unfavorable impact of currency fluctuations 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  benefits and expenses increased million  from billion in to billion in this increase reflects higher interest credited to policyholders account balances and higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs both related to the continued growth of our us dollar denominated annuity product 
mostly offsetting these items is a decrease in policyholder benefits  including changes in reserves  which was driven by more favorable mortality experience  as well as the attrition of existing business as discussed above 
we have recently undertaken an initiative in japan to enhance our information processes and technology systems in order to improve efficiency and lower costs 
we currently estimate that we will incur million of non capitalizable costs related to this initiative in  with the vast majority of these expenditures to be recognized in our gibraltar life operations

excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  benefits and expenses increased million  from billion in to billion in benefits and expenses of our japanese life planner operation increased million  from billion in to billion in  while benefits and expenses from our korean operation increased million  from million in to billion in the increase in benefits and expenses in both operations reflects an increase in policyholder benefits  including changes in reserves  which was driven by new sales and strong persistency 
also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses are higher general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of business growth 
gibraltar life s benefits and expenses declined million  from billion in to billion in  including a million favorable impact of currency fluctuations 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  benefits and expenses declined million  from billion in to billion in this decline is primarily due to the effects of the special dividend arrangement discussed above and the million charge recognized in for refinements in policy liabilities 
partially offsetting the decline in benefits and expenses was higher interest credited to policyholders account balances resulting from growth in our us dollar denominated fixed annuity product 
sales results in managing our international insurance business  we analyze revenues  as well as annualized new business premiums  which do not correspond to revenues under us gaap 
annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the segment  while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies written in prior years and net investment income  in addition to current sales 
annualized new business premiums include of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products 
annualized new business premiums on an actual and constant exchange rate basis are as follows for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in millions annualized new business premiums on an actual exchange rate basis life planner operations gibraltar life total on a constant exchange rate basis life planner operations gibraltar life total the methodology for determining gibraltar life s annualized new business premium on an actual and constant exchange rate basis has been revised to more clearly report the trend of us dollar product sales 
prior period amounts have been restated to conform to current presentation 
to annual comparison 
on a constant exchange rate basis  annualized new business premiums increased million  from billion in to billion in annualized new business premiums  on a constant exchange rate basis  from our life planner operations decreased million 
sales through the first nine months of were relatively flat  with growth in japan offset by a decline in korea reflecting the continued competitive market environment 
however  due to the economic environment and concerns over us financial institutions  sales in the fourth quarter of declined from the prior year quarter  with declines in both japan and korea 
the number of life planners increased  or  from  as of december  to  as of december   driven by increases of in taiwan  in korea  and in argentina 
during  life planners in japan were transferred to gibraltar primarily to support our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution 
factoring in these transfers  the number of life planners in japan would have increased  from december  to december   which reflects lower recruiting in japan in the later part of due to a more selective screening process meant to further improve life planner retention and quality  as well as recruiting challenges posed by the current economic environment 
annualized new business premiums  on a constant exchange rate basis  from our gibraltar life operation increased million  primarily reflecting strong sales of a new us dollar denominated retirement income product launched in the first quarter of  as well as higher sales of our us dollar denominated fixed annuity product and a new single premium yen denominated endowment product 
the number of life advisors increased by  from  as of december  to  as of december   as we continue to focus on hiring practices to enhance retention and productivity 
the life planners transferred to gibraltar as discussed above  are not considered life advisors  as they sell only through the bank channel 
to annual comparison 
on a constant exchange rate basis  annualized new business premiums increased million  from billion in to billion in on this same basis  annualized new business premiums from our japanese life planner operations increased million reflecting increased sales of retirement income and us dollar denominated whole life products  partially offset by lower sales of increasing term life products to corporations as a result of pending tax law changes 
sales in all other countries  also on a constant exchange rate basis  increased million as decreased sales in korea mostly offset increased sales in taiwan and the rest of our life planner operations 
the number of life planners increased  or  from  as of december  to  as of december  this increase was driven by increases of  and in our life planner operations in japan  korea and taiwan  respectively 
in addition  during  life planners in japan were transferred to gibraltar primarily to support our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution 
annualized new business premiums  on a constant exchange rate basis  from our gibraltar life operation decreased million from to  primarily due to lower sales of our us dollar denominated single premium fixed annuity  particularly in our bank distribution channel  which was partially offset by higher sales of our us dollar whole life product and other traditional insurance products 
the number of life advisor s increased  or  from  as of december  to  as of december  investment margins and other profitability factors many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates 
japanese authorities regulate interest rates guaranteed in our japanese insurance contracts 
the regulated guaranteed interest rates do not necessarily match the actual returns on the underlying investments 
the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will experience on these products 
with regulatory approval  guaranteed rates may be changed on new business 
while these actions enhance our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns  the major sources of profitability on our products sold in japan  other than those sold by gibraltar life  are margins on mortality  morbidity and expense charges rather than investment spreads 
we base premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality and morbidity tables 
our mortality and morbidity experience in the international insurance segment on an overall basis in the years ended december    and was well within our pricing assumptions and below the guaranteed levels reflected in the premiums we charge

on january   we made an additional investment of million in our ubi pramerica operating joint venture in italy  which we account for under the equity method 
this additional investment was necessary to maintain our ownership interest at percent and was a result of the merger of our joint venture partner with another italian bank  and their subsequent consolidation of their asset management companies into the ubi pramerica joint venture 
on july   we acquired a percent interest in gap asset management of brazil  which we account for under the equity method as an operating joint venture 
gap asset management of brazil had billion in assets under management as of june  and billion in assets under management as of december   reflecting a decline in assets under management attributable to client outflows and foreign exchange movements 
adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income decreased million  from income of million in to a loss of million in  primarily reflecting impairment charges of million related to operating joint ventures and goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of million to the carrying value of certain operating joint ventures associated with the segment s asset management businesses 
these operating joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method and the impairments related to our joint ventures in italy  brazil and mexico 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million associated with the segment s asset management businesses 
both the goodwill and joint venture impairments reflect the significant deterioration in financial market conditions that occurred during the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a decline in our anticipated future asset management and transaction based fees  and hence a decrease in the expected future earnings of the segment s asset management businesses 
as of december   the remaining carrying value of our operating joint ventures and goodwill was million and million  respectively  related to the segment s asset management businesses 
there are no operating joint ventures or goodwill associated with the segment s global commodities group 
see accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates goodwill for further discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to determine the goodwill impairment 
also contributing to the decrease in adjusted operating income is the benefit in of a million gain from the sale of the segment s oppenheim joint ventures and a million gain from recoveries related to a former investment of the segment s korean asset management operation 
the decrease also reflects lower results from the segment s asset management businesses  primarily in our korean operation  as well as lower results from the segment s global commodities group 
the decrease in earnings for the global commodities group is driven by lower gains on securities relating to exchange memberships  which benefited by million  while benefiting by million  as well as a million credit loss related to a brokerage client that was recorded in the first quarter of the adjusted operating income of our korean asset management operation includes million and million in and  respectively  of fee revenue from the korean government under an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of pisc  related to the provision of asset management and brokerage services  which agreement extends until february  to annual comparison

revenues to annual comparison 
revenues  as shown in the table above under operating results  decreased million  from million in to million in  primarily reflecting the million operating joint venture impairments discussed above 
this decrease also reflects lower revenues from the segment s asset management businesses  primarily in our korean operation  as well as the benefit to of the gain from the sale of oppenheim and the gain from the recovery of a former investment  as discussed above 
partially offsetting this decrease were higher revenues in our global commodities group due to increased sales and trading activity  which more than offset the lower benefit in from securities relating to exchange memberships 
to annual comparison

expenses  as shown in the table above under operating results  increased million  from million in to million in  primarily reflecting the million goodwill impairment discussed above 
this decrease also reflects the million credit loss in our global commodities group and higher expenses corresponding with the higher level of revenues generated by the sales and trading activity of our global commodities group 
partially offsetting these items were lower expenses in the segment s asset management businesses corresponding with the lower level of revenues generated by these businesses

see accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates goodwill for further discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to determine the goodwill impairment 
also contributing to the decline in adjusted operating income are lower royalty fees  increased bad debt reserves and lower relocation revenue from real estate referral fees and homesale transactions due to the less favorable residential real estate market conditions

in addition  corporate operations investment income  net of interest expense  excluding capital debt interest expense  decreased million  primarily reflecting lower earnings from the investment of proceeds from our convertible debt issues  as discussed below  and lower yields on invested assets 
partially offsetting these items was the benefit from other corporate activities of million  reflecting a decline in our deferred compensation liabilities and other compensation related items in versus the prior year  as well as lower costs associated with philanthropic activities and other retained corporate expenses 
this benefit was partially offset by increased costs related to our retained obligations relating to policyholders with whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life sales practices remediation 
both our deferred compensation liabilities and our retained obligations to certain policyholders are impacted by financial market conditions 
the billion november convertible debt securities  for which investment of proceeds in fixed income securities contributed to results of  were repaid in may the proceeds from our billion december convertible debt issuance were used to fund an investment portfolio of fixed income securities until december  which also benefited results of the prior year 
these proceeds  as well as the remaining proceeds from our billion december convertible debt issuance  were invested primarily in short term investments or used to support operating needs in lieu of other short term borrowings 
in december  we repurchased substantially all of our billion december convertible debt issuance 
in december  we also repurchased  in individually negotiated transactions  million of our billion december convertible debt issuance  which notes were offered to us by certain holders 
the notes were repurchased at a discount resulting in a pre tax gain of million  which is included in other corporate activities 
corporate operations pension income and employee benefits increased million  which primarily reflects the impact of census and other demographic assumption updates to our post retirement and post employment benefit plans 
income from our qualified pension plan decreased million  from million in to million in  reflecting the impact of the transfer in april of billion in plan assets within the qualified pension plan under section of the internal revenue code from assets supporting pension benefits to assets supporting retiree medical benefits 
however  as a result of the transfer  the decline in income from our qualified pension plan was offset by a corresponding decline in other postretirement benefit expenses 
for purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended december   we will decrease the discount rate to from in the expected return on plan assets will decline from in to in and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 
we determined our expected return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation  real return  term premium  credit spreads  equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses  expected asset manager performance and the effect of rebalancing for the equity  debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio 
giving effect to the foregoing assumptions and other factors  we expect on a consolidated basis income from our own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to adjusted operating income in  but at a level of about million to million higher than that of the year other postretirement benefit expenses will increase in a range of million to million 
the increase in other postretirement benefit expense is driven primarily by the decline in plan asset values 
in  pension and other postretirement benefit service costs related to active employees will continue to be allocated to our business segments 
to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income decreased million  from income of million in to a loss of million in adjusted operating income from corporate operations decreased million  from a loss of million in to a loss of million in corporate operations investment income  net of interest expense  excluding capital debt interest expense decreased million  primarily reflecting the impact of deployment of our excess capital in our businesses and for share repurchases  and less favorable income from equity method investments  including tax credit investments  partially offset by investment income  net of related interest expense  from the investment of proceeds from our billion november convertible debt issuance and our billion december convertible debt issuance 
in may the company called for redemption the november convertible debt securities 
corporate operations includes income from our qualified pension plan of million in  an increase of million from million in the increase reflects changes in the market value of our plan assets 
during we transferred billion of assets within the qualified pension plan under section of the internal revenue code from assets supporting pension benefits to assets supporting retiree medical benefits 
adjusted operating income of our real estate and relocation services business decreased million  from million in to million in the decline reflected lower transaction volume associated with less favorable residential real estate market conditions as well as a fixed asset write off in results of operations of closed block business we established the closed block business effective as of the date of demutualization 
the closed block business includes our in force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies  as well as other assets and equity and related liabilities that support these policies 
we no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies 
see overview closed block business for additional details 
at the end of each year  the board of directors of prudential insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the closed block  including investment income  net realized and unrealized investment gains  mortality experience and other factors 
although closed block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results  at the time the closed block was established  we developed  as required by us gaap  an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block 
if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected  we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation 
we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected 
the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of prudential insurance 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million 
actual cumulative earnings  as required by us gaap  reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period  as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the closed block policies 
however  due to the accumulation of net unrealized investment losses that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block  the policyholder dividend obligation balance as of december  is zero 
operating results management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess the operating performance of the closed block business 
consequently  results of the closed block business for all periods are presented only in accordance with us gaap 
the following table sets forth the closed block business us gaap results for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in millions us gaap results revenues benefits and expenses income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures to annual comparison 
income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures decreased million  from million in to million in results for include a decrease of million in net realized investment gains  from million in to million in for a discussion of closed block business realized investment gains losses  net  see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses 
net investment income  net of interest expense  decreased million  primarily related to lower yields and a decrease in income on joint ventures and limited partnership investments accounted for under the equity method 
these decreases to income were partially offset by a decrease in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders  primarily due to a decrease in the dividend scale 
the impact of these items contributed to actual cumulative earnings which  when compared to the expected cumulative earnings  resulted in a decrease in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense of million from  compared to as noted above  as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million 
if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  it could result in volatility in the closed block business earnings 
to annual comparison 
income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures decreased million  from million in to million in results for reflect an increase in dividends to policyholders of million reflecting an increase in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders primarily due to an increase in the dividend scale  as well as an increase in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense of million 
in addition  results for reflect higher claim costs that continue to increase with the aging of the closed block policyholders  while results for included a reserve release as a result of reserve factor updates 
these decreases to income were partially offset by an increase of million in net investment income  net of interest expense  primarily related to higher income on joint venture and limited partnership investments and higher dividend income from public equity investments  and an increase of million in net realized investment gains  from million in to million in for a discussion of closed block business realized investment gains losses  net  see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses 
revenues to annual comparison 
revenues  as shown in the table above under operating results  decreased million  from billion in to billion in  principally driven by the million decrease in net realized investment gains and a decrease of million in net investment income  as discussed above 
to annual comparison 
revenues increased million  from billion in to billion in  principally driven by the million increase in net realized investment gains and an increase of million in net investment income 
the increase in net investment income reflects higher income on joint venture and limited partnership investments and public equity investments 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in premiums  with a corresponding decline in changes in reserves  as the policies in force have matured or terminated 
we expect this decline in premiums for this business to continue as these polices continue to mature or terminate 
benefits and expenses to annual comparison 
benefits and expenses  as shown in the table above under operating results  decreased million  from billion in to billion in this decrease included a million decline in dividends to policyholders reflecting a decrease in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense of million  as well as a decrease in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders of million  primarily due to a decrease in the dividend scale  partially offset by the dividend scale increase  a higher dividend accumulation crediting rate and normal growth 
to annual comparison 
benefits and expenses increased million  from billion in to billion in this increase reflects a million increase in dividends to policyholders reflecting an increase in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders primarily due to an increase in the dividend scale  as well as an increase in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense of million 
policyholders benefits  including changes in reserves  increased million primarily reflecting higher claim costs in that continue to increase with the aging of the closed block policyholders  and a reserve release in income taxes shown below is our income tax provision for the years ended december   and  separately reflecting the impact of certain significant items 
also presented below is the income tax provision that would have resulted from application of the statutory federal income tax rate in each of these periods 
year ended december  in millions tax provision impact of low income housing and other tax credits non taxable investment income foreign taxes at other than us rate state and local taxes change in valuation allowance non deductible expenses non deductible goodwill impairment other tax provision excluding these items tax provision at statutory rate we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on january  for additional information regarding the adoption of this guidance  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the decline in income tax expense primarily reflects the decline in pre tax income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures for the year ended december  the impact of non taxable investment income on the total tax provision decreased in as compared to and  primarily due to a decrease in the dividends received deduction  or drd  and non deductible investment losses related to corporate owned life insurance 
the drd reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and in prior years was the primary component of the non taxable investment income shown in the table above  and  as such  is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense and the expected amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 
the drd for the current period was estimated using information available from current year results  information from calculations  and estimates to take into account the current year s equity market performance 
the actual current year drd can vary from the estimate based on factors such as  but not limited to  changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the drd  changes in the amount of distributions received from mutual fund investments  changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts  and our taxable income before the drd 
in august  the internal revenue service  or irs  issued revenue ruling  which included  among other items  guidance on the methodology to be followed in calculating the drd related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts 
in september  the irs released revenue ruling revenue ruling suspends revenue ruling and informs taxpayers that the us treasury department and the irs intend to address through new regulations the issues considered in revenue ruling  including the methodology to be followed in determining the drd related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts 
a change in the drd  including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through regulations or legislation  could increase our actual tax expense and reduce our consolidated net income 
these activities had no impact on our or results 
in december  the irs completed all fieldwork with regards to its examination of the consolidated federal income tax returns for tax years and the final report was initially submitted to the joint committee on taxation for their review in april the final report was resubmitted in march and again in april the joint committee returned the report to the irs for additional review of the industry issue regarding the methodology for calculating the drd related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts 
the irs completed its review of the issue and proposed an adjustment with respect to the calculation of the drd 
in order to expedite receipt of an income tax refund related to the and years  we have agreed to such adjustment 
nevertheless  we believe that our return position is technically correct 
therefore  we intend to file a protective refund claim to recover the taxes associated with the agreed upon adjustment and to pursue such other actions as appropriate 
the report  with the adjustment  was submitted to the joint committee on taxation in october we were advised on january  that the joint committee completed its consideration of the report and has taken no exception to the conclusions reached by the irs 
accordingly  the final report was processed and a refund was received 
the statute of limitations for these years will close on december  these activities had no impact on our or results 
discontinued operations included within net income are the results of businesses which are reflected as discontinued operations under us gaap

this business consists of our investment in the wachovia securities joint venture described below  in addition to expenses relating to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the businesses we contributed to the joint venture  primarily for litigation and regulatory matters 
on july   we combined our retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of wachovia corporation  or wachovia  and formed wachovia securities financial holdings  llc  or wachovia securities  a joint venture currently headquartered in st 
louis  missouri 
wachovia securities  one of the nation s largest retail brokerage and clearing organizations  provides full service securities brokerage and financial advisory services to individuals and businesses 
wachovia and wachovia securities are distribution partners for certain of our products  including our mutual funds and individual annuities that are distributed through their financial advisors  bank channel and independent channel 
on october   wachovia completed the acquisition of ag edwards  inc  or ag edwards  and on january  contributed the retail securities brokerage business of ag edwards to the joint venture 
wachovia s contribution of this business entitled us to elect a lookback option which we elected that permits us to delay for a period of two years ending on january   our decision on whether or not to make payments to avoid or limit dilution of our ownership interest in the joint venture 
during this lookback period  our share in the earnings of the joint venture and one time costs associated with the combination of the ag edwards business with wachovia securities is based on our diluted ownership level  which is in the process of being determined 
at the end of the lookback period  we may put our joint venture interests to wachovia based on the appraised value of the joint venture  excluding the ag edwards business  as of january   the date of the combination of the ag edwards business with wachovia securities 
based upon the existing agreements and our estimates of the values of the ag edwards business and the joint venture excluding the ag edwards business  we adjusted the carrying value of our ownership interest in the joint venture effective as of january  to reflect the addition of the ag edwards business and the dilution of our ownership interest and to record the value of the above described rights under the lookback option 
as a result  we recognized an increase to additional paid in capital of billion  net of tax 
establishment of definitive agreed or appraised values for the ag edwards business and the joint venture excluding the ag edwards business  will result in an adjustment to the credit to equity and a true up to the earnings from the joint venture for any difference between the diluted ownership percentage used to record earnings for the year ended december  and the finally determined diluted ownership percentage 
we do not anticipate any such adjustment to have a material effect on our reported results of operations 
on october   wachovia and wells fargo company  or wells fargo  announced that they had entered into an agreement and plan of merger  pursuant to which wachovia would be merged into wells fargo  which would succeed to wachovia s rights and obligations under the joint venture arrangements 
as reported by wells fargo  this merger was completed on december  on december   we announced our intention  assuming completion of the merger of wachovia into wells fargo  to exercise our right under the lookback option to put our joint venture interests to wells fargo 
under the terms of the joint venture agreements  closing of the put transaction would occur on or about january  as indicated above  the results associated with our joint venture interest have been classified as results of a divested business  reflecting our intention to exit this business 
earnings of the joint venture  which are included in corporate and other operations are subject to certain risks pertaining to the joint venture operations  including customer claims  litigation and regulatory investigations affecting wachovia securities businesses 
such customer claims  litigation and regulatory matters include matters typical for retail securities brokerage and clearing operations and matters unique to the joint venture operations 
in recent months  following the failure in early of the auctions which set the rates for most auction rate securities  wachovia securities has become the subject of customer complaints  legal actions  including a putative class action  and investigations by securities regulators and agencies relating to wachovia securities role in the underwriting  sale and auction of auction rate securities 
on august   wachovia announced that it had reached an agreement in principle for a global settlement of investigations concerning the underwriting  sale and subsequent auction of certain auction rate securities by subsidiaries of wachovia securities and had recorded an increase to legal reserves 
the losses from the financial advisory business of million in include our share of earnings from wachovia securities  on a pre tax basis  of a loss of million  based on our estimated diluted ownership level  as discussed above  compared to income of million in the results of wachovia securities for include a charge of million related to the agreement in principle for a global settlement concerning the underwriting  sale and subsequent auction of certain auction rate securities  as discussed above and transition costs of million related to the combination of the ag edwards business with wachovia securities 
commercial mortgage securitization operations in  we classified our commercial mortgage securitization operations as a divested business  reflecting our decision to exit this business 
these operations  which involved the origination and purchase of commercial mortgage loans that we in turn would aggregate and sell into commercial mortgage backed securitization transactions  together with related hedging activities  were previously reported within the asset management segment 
we retained and continue the remainder of our commercial mortgage origination  servicing and other commercial mortgage related activities  which remain a part of our asset management segment 
as of december   our commercial mortgage securitization operations held loans with a principal balance of million  whose fair values continue to be subject to changes in credit spreads 
this represents a decrease from about million as of december  the losses of million in primarily reflect net realized and unrealized losses on the loans  bonds and hedges from instability in the commercial mortgage backed securities market during exchange shares previously held by prudential equity group in  we exited the equity sales  trading and research operations of the prudential equity group  and the results of these operations are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning prudential equity group 
we retained certain securities relating to trading exchange memberships of these former operations 
these securities were received in in connection with the commencement of public trading of stock exchange shares 
the changes in the fair value of these shares are reflected within divested businesses for all periods presented 
property and casualty insurance in  we sold our property and casualty insurance companies that operated nationally in states outside of new jersey  and the district of columbia  to liberty mutual group  and our new jersey property and casualty insurance companies to palisades group 
results of these property and casualty insurance operations are reflected as a divested business for all periods presented 
we have retained liabilities for pre closing litigation and obligations under reinsurance contracts provided in connection with potential adverse loss development on the business sold to liberty mutual group 
prudential securities capital markets in  we announced a restructuring of prudential securities capital markets activities in which we exited the lead managed equity underwriting business for corporate issuers and the institutional fixed income business 
results of these operations are reflected as a divested business for all periods presented 
as of december  we had remaining assets amounting to million related to prudential securities institutional fixed income activities 
prudential home mortgage company during and  we sold substantially all of our residential first mortgage banking and related operations of prudential home mortgage company  inc and its affiliates 
results of these operations are reflected as a divested business for all periods presented 
we remain liable with respect to certain claims concerning these operations prior to sale which we believe are adequately reserved 
investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes certain products included in the retirement and international insurance segments  are experience rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders 
the investments supporting these experience rated products  excluding commercial mortgage and other loans  are classified as trading and are carried at fair value 
these trading investments are reflected on the statements of financial position as trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value 
realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in asset management fees and other income 
interest and dividend income for these investments is reported in net investment income 
commercial mortgage and other loans that support these experience rated products are carried at unpaid principal  net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses  and are reflected on the statements of financial position as commercial mortgage and other loans 
adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities 
this is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains and losses with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis 
in addition  to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains and losses on available for sale securities  adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments including commercial mortgage and other loans supporting these experience rated contracts  which are reflected in interest credited to policyholders account balances 
the result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest spread we earn on these experience rated contracts  and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments  both realized and unrealized  that we expect will accrue to the contractholders 
results for the years ended december   and include the recognition of net investment losses of billion  and net investment gains of zero million and million  respectively  on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value 
these net investment gains and losses primarily represent interest rate related mark to market adjustments  which include the impact of changes in credit spreads  on fixed maturity securities 
consistent with our treatment of realized investment gains losses  net  these gains and losses  which are expected to ultimately accrue to the contractholders  are excluded from adjusted operating income 
in addition  results for the years ended december   and include decreases of billion  million and million  respectively  in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments that support these experience rated contracts 
these liability changes are reflected in interest credited to policyholders account balances and are also excluded from adjusted operating income 
contractholder liabilities do not reflect declines in recorded asset values of million  which we expect to recover in future periods through increases in recorded asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities 
in addition  as prescribed by us gaap  changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans held in our general account  other than when associated with impairments  are not recognized in income in the current period  while the impact of these changes in value are reflected as a change in the liability to fully participating contractholders in the current period 
included in the amounts above related to the change in the liability to contractholders are decreases related to commercial mortgage and other loans of million  and increases related to commercial mortgage and other loans of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to us for identical assets or liabilities 
these generally provide the most reliable evidence and are used to measure fair value whenever available 
active markets are defined as having the following for the measured asset liability i many transactions  ii current prices  iii price quotes not varying substantially among market makers  iv narrow bid ask spreads and v most information publicly available 
our level assets and liabilities primarily include certain cash equivalents and short term investments  equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market 
prices are obtained from readily available sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities 
level fair value is based on significant inputs  other than level inputs  that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data 
level inputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities  quoted market prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities and other market observable inputs 
our level assets and liabilities include fixed maturities corporate public and private bonds  most government securities  certain asset and mortgage backed securities  etc  certain equity securities and commercial mortgage loans  short term investments and certain cash equivalents primarily commercial paper and certain over the counter derivatives 
valuations are generally obtained from third party pricing services for identical or comparable assets or liabilities  or through the use of valuation methodologies using observable market inputs 
prices from services are validated through comparison to trade data and internal estimates of current fair value  developed using market observable inputs and economic indicators 
level fair value is based on at least one or more significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
these inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
our level assets and liabilities primarily include certain private fixed maturities and equity securities  certain manually priced public equity securities and fixed maturities  including certain asset backed securities and securities where we chose to over ride pricing information received from third parties as discussed below  certain highly structured over the counter derivative contracts  certain commercial mortgage loans  certain consolidated real estate funds for which we are the general partner  and embedded derivatives resulting from certain products with guaranteed benefits 
prices are determined using valuation methodologies such as option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and other similar techniques 
non binding broker quotes  which we utilize when pricing service information is not available  are reviewed for reasonableness based on our understanding of the market  and are generally considered level under certain conditions  we may conclude the prices received from independent third party pricing services or brokers are not reasonable or reflective of market activity 
in those instances  we may choose to over ride the third party pricing information or quotes received and apply internally developed values to the related assets or liabilities 
in such cases  the valuations are generally classified as level as of december  such over rides on a net basis were not material 
the tables below present the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  as of december   for consolidated  financial services businesses and closed block business

excluding separate account assets for which the risk is borne by the policyholder  the amount of level assets taken as a percentage of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis totaled for both consolidated and financial services businesses 
the amount of level liabilities was immaterial to our balance sheet 
netting amounts represent cash collateral and the impact of offsetting asset and liability positions held with the same counterparty as permitted by fasb interpretation no 
 offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts and fsp fin  amendment of fasb interpretation no 
separate account assets represent segregated funds that are invested for certain customers 
investment risks associated with market value changes are borne by the customers  except to the extent of minimum guarantees made by us with respect to certain accounts 
separate account assets classified as level consist primarily of real estate and real estate investment funds 
separate account liabilities are not included in the above table as they are reported at contract value and not fair value in our consolidated statement of financial position 
the negative other liability amount for financial services businesses reflects the impact of inter company eliminations 
for additional information regarding the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value by hierarchy level see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the determination of fair value  which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions  can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
as discussed in more detail below  the determination of fair value for certain assets and liabilities may require the application of a greater degree of judgment given current market conditions  as the ability to value assets can be significantly impacted by a decrease in market activity 
the following sections describe the key estimates and assumptions surrounding certain assets and liabilities  measured at fair value on a recurring basis  that could have a significant impact on our results of operations or involve the use of significant unobservable inputs 
information regarding separate account assets is excluded as the risk of assets for these categories is ultimately borne by our customers and policyholders 
valuation of fixed maturity securities our public fixed maturity securities include investments in corporate securities  government securities and various structured securities  including asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
the fair values of our public fixed maturity securities are generally based on prices obtained from independent pricing services 
prices are sourced from multiple pricing services  and a vendor hierarchy is maintained by asset type based on historical pricing experience and vendor expertise 
we generally receive prices from multiple pricing services for each security  but ultimately use the price from the pricing service highest in the vendor hierarchy based on the respective asset type 
in order to validate reasonability  prices are reviewed by our internal asset managers through comparison with directly observed recent market trades and internal estimates of current fair value  developed using market observable inputs and economic indicators 
consistent with the fair value hierarchy described above  securities with validated quotes from pricing services are generally reflected within level if we conclude pricing information received from third party pricing services is not reflective of market activity or other inputs we have observed in the market  we may challenge the price through a formal process with the pricing service 
if the pricing service updates the price to be more reasonable in comparison to our presented market observations  the security remains within level if we ultimately conclude that pricing information received from the independent pricing service is not reflective of market activity  we use values based on non binding broker quotes  if available 
if we conclude values from both pricing services and brokers are not reflective of market activity  we may over ride the information from the pricing service or broker with an internally developed valuation 
as of december   such over rides  in aggregate  were not material 
in circumstances where vendor pricing is not available  we also use internally developed valuations or non binding broker quotes to determine fair value 
these estimates may use significant unobservable inputs  which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset 
circumstances where observable market data is not available may include events such as market illiquidity and credit events related to the security 
pricing service over rides  internally developed valuations and non binding broker quotes are generally included in level in our fair value hierarchy 
despite the dislocated markets and low levels of liquidity at the end of  pricing received from the independent pricing services was not materially different from our internal estimates of current market value for the vast majority of our fixed maturity portfolio 
as a result  we generally continued to use the price provided by the independent pricing service under our normal pricing protocol 
our private fixed maturities are primarily comprised of investments in private placement securities originated by our internal private asset managers 
the fair values of these private fixed maturities are primarily determined using a discounted cash flow model  which utilizes a discount rate based upon the average of spread surveys collected from private market intermediaries who are active in both primary and secondary transactions  and takes into account  among other factors  the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with private placements 
generally  these securities have been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
for certain of these securities  including those that are distressed  the discounted cash flow model may also incorporate significant unobservable inputs  which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset 
accordingly  these securities have been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
private fixed maturities also include debt investments in funds that  in addition to a stated coupon  pay a return based upon the results of the underlying portfolios 
the fair values of these securities are determined by reference to the funds net asset value nav 
any restrictions on our ability to redeem our interests in these funds at nav are considered to have a de minimis effect on the fair value 
since the nav at which the funds trade can be observed by redemption and subscription transactions between third parties  the fair values of these investments have been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
our level fixed maturity securities generally include certain public fixed maturities and private fixed maturities priced internally based on observable and unobservable inputs 
as of december   about half of our level fixed maturity securities were public fixed maturities  with values primarily based on non binding broker quotes  and about half were private fixed maturities  with values primary based on internally developed models  as discussed above 
significant unobservable inputs used include issue specific credit adjustments  material non public financial information  management judgment  estimation of future earnings and cashflows  default rate assumptions  liquidity assumptions and non binding quotes from market makers 
these inputs are usually considered unobservable  as not all market participants will have access to this data 
as of december  we classified approximately million of our investments in asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages as level  primarily reflecting securities valued based on non binding broker quotes 
the vast majority of our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages are valued using information from independent pricing services  and are included in level based on the process described above 
net realized and unrealized losses for level available for sale fixed maturities totaled million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  for additional information regarding our holdings of asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages  see  realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities asset backed securities 
while the fair value of these investments  as well as others within our portfolio of fixed maturities  has declined in recent quarters due to increased credit spreads and illiquidity in the financial markets  we believe the ultimate value that will be realized from these investments is greater than that reflected by their current fair value 
valuation of equity securities equity securities consist principally of investments in common and preferred stock of publicly traded companies  privately traded securities  as well as common stock mutual fund shares 
the fair values of most publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and are classified within level in our fair value hierarchy 
estimated fair values for privately traded equity securities are determined using valuation and discounted cash flow models that require a substantial level of judgment 
in determining the fair value of certain privately traded equity securities the discounted cash flow model may also use unobservable inputs  which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset 
most privately traded equity securities are classified within level the fair values of common stock mutual fund shares that transact regularly but do not trade in active markets because they are not publicly available are based on transaction prices of identical fund shares and are classified within level in our fair value hierarchy 
the fair values of preferred equity securities are based on prices obtained from independent pricing services and  in order to validate reasonability  are compared with recent market trades we have directly observed 
accordingly  these securities are generally classified within level in our fair value hierarchy 
impact of valuation of fixed maturities and equity securities on results of operations the impact our determination of fair value for fixed maturity and equity securities has on our results of operations is dependent on our classification of the security as either trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
for our investments classified as trading  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
for our investments classified as available for sale  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net  a separate component of equity 
our investments classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
in addition  investments classified as available for sale  as well as those classified as held to maturity  are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
when it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security is impaired to its fair value  with a corresponding charge to realized investment gains losses  net in the statement of operations and is included in income from continuing operations under us gaap but excluded from adjusted operating income 
the level of impairment losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve

valuation of commercial mortgage loans upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  we elected the fair value option for certain loans held within the commercial mortgage operations of the asset management segment 
specifically  the fair value option was elected for funded commercial mortgage loans held for sale that were originated beginning january  in addition  we elected the fair value option for fixed rate commercial mortgage loans held for investment that were held at december  and for such loans originated beginning january  we elected the fair value option for the loan programs mentioned above primarily to eliminate the need for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 while still achieving an offset in earnings from the associated interest rate derivative hedges 
due to volatility in the credit markets  we experienced unexpected volatility in the fair value of the aforementioned fixed rate commercial mortgage loans held for investment that was not substantially offset by the associated interest rate derivative hedges during the quarter ended march  therefore  we decided to no longer elect the fair value option on loans held for investment that were originated after march   and have applied hedge accounting under sfas no 
the fair value of loans held for investment and accounted for using the fair value option discussed above is determined based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the appropriate us treasury rate  adjusted for the current market spread for similar quality loans 
since the interest rate and market spread assumptions for similar quality loans are generally observable based upon market transactions  the fair value of loans held for investment has been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
the fair value of loans held for sale and accounted for using the fair value option discussed above  as well as those loans reported at fair value on a non recurring basis accounted for using the lower of cost or market approach is determined utilizing pricing indicators from the whole loan market  which we consider our principal exit market for these loans 
we have evaluated the valuation inputs used for these assets  including the terms of the loans  prevailing interest rates and credit risk  and deemed that the primary pricing inputs are level in our fair value hierarchy 
valuation of other long term investments other long term investments carried at fair value include limited partnerships which we consolidate because we are either deemed to exercise control or are considered the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
these entities are considered investment companies and follow specialized industry accounting whereby their assets are carried at fair value 
the investments held by these entities include various feeder fund investments in underlying master funds whose underlying holdings generally include public fixed maturities and equity securities  as well as wholly owned real estate held within other investment funds 
the fair value of the feeder fund investments in master funds is determined by reference to the master funds net asset value nav 
any restrictions on our ability to redeem our interests in these funds at nav are considered to have a de minimis effect on fair value 
since the nav at which these funds trade can be observed by redemption and subscription transactions with third parties  the fair values of feeder fund investments in master funds have been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
the fair value of wholly owned real estate held in consolidated investment funds is determined through an independent appraisal process 
the appraisals generally utilize a discounted cash flow model  following an income approach  that incorporates various assumptions including rental revenue  operating expenses and discount rates 
these appraisals and the related assumptions are updated at least annually  and incorporate historical property experience and any observable market data  including any market transactions 
since many of the assumptions utilized are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the valuation  the real estate investments within other long term investments have been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
consolidated real estate investment funds classified as level as of december  totaled approximately billion 
our direct investment in these funds is not material  and the majority of the assets recorded as a result of the consolidation of these funds is offset by a minority interest liability  which liability is not considered to be fair value and therefore  not included in fair value reporting above 
valuation of derivative instruments derivatives are recorded at fair value either as assets  within other trading account assets  or other long term investments  or as liabilities  within other liabilities  except for embedded derivatives which are recorded with the associated host contract 
the fair values of derivative contracts are determined based on quoted prices in active exchanges or through the use of valuation models 
the fair values of derivative contracts can be affected by changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  credit spreads  market volatility  expected returns  nonperformance risk and liquidity as well as other factors 
liquidity valuation adjustments are made to reflect the cost of exiting significant risk positions  and consider the bid ask spread  maturity  complexity  and other specific attributes of the underlying derivative position 
fair values can also be affected by changes in estimates and assumptions including those related to counterparty behavior used in valuation models 
our over the counter  or otc  derivative contracts are executed under master netting agreements with counterparties with a credit support annex  or csa  which is a bilateral ratings sensitive agreement that requires collateral postings at established credit threshold levels 
these agreements protect our interest  as well as those of our counterparties  should either party suffer a credit rating deterioration 
the vast majority of our derivative agreements are with highly rated major international financial institutions 
consistent with the practice of major international financial institutions  we use the credit spread embedded in the libor interest rate curve to reflect nonperformance risk when determining the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities 
we believe this credit spread is an appropriate estimate of the nonperformance risk for derivative related assets and liabilities between highly rated institutions 
our exchange traded futures and options include treasury futures  eurodollar futures  commodity futures  eurodollar options and commodity options 
exchange traded futures and options are valued using quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level in our fair value hierarchy 
the majority of our derivative positions are traded in the otc derivative market and are classified within level in our fair value hierarchy 
otc derivatives classified within level are valued using models generally accepted in the financial services industry that use actively quoted or observable market input values from external market data providers  non binding broker dealer quotations  third party pricing vendors and or recent trading activity 
the fair values of most otc derivatives  including forward rate agreements  interest rate and cross currency swaps  commodity swaps  commodity forward contracts  single name credit default swaps and to be announced forward contracts on highly rated mortgage backed securities issued by us government sponsored entities are determined using discounted cash flow models 
the fair values of european style option contracts are determined using black scholes option pricing models 
these models key assumptions include the contractual terms of the respective contract  along with significant observable inputs  including interest rates  currency rates  credit spreads  yield curves  equity prices  index dividend yields  nonperformance risk and volatility 
most otc derivative contracts have bid and ask prices that can be readily observed in the market place 
our policy is to use mid market pricing consistent with our best estimate of fair value 
the bid ask spreads for derivatives classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are generally wider than derivatives classified within level thus requiring more judgment in estimating the mid market price of such derivatives 
the fair values of otc derivative assets and liabilities classified as level totaled approximately billion and million  respectively  without giving consideration to the impact of netting  as of december  derivatives that are valued based upon models with unobservable market input values or input values from less actively traded or less developed markets are classified within level in our fair value hierarchy 
derivatives classified as level include first to default credit basket swaps  look back equity options and other structured options 
for additional information regarding embedded derivatives in our annuity and retirement products classified as level  see valuation of variable annuity optional living benefit features below 
the fair values of first to default credit basket swaps are derived from relevant observable inputs such as individual credit default spreads  interest rates  recovery rates and unobservable model specific input values such as correlation between different credits within the same basket 
look back equity options and other structured options and derivatives are valued using simulation models such as the monte carlo technique 
the input values for look back equity options are derived from observable market indices such as interest rates  dividend yields  equity indices as well as unobservable model specific input values such as certain volatility parameters 
level methodologies are validated through periodic comparison of our fair values to broker dealer s values 
all realized and unrealized changes in fair value of non dealer related derivatives  with the exception of the effective portion of cash flow hedges and effective hedges of net investments in foreign operations  are recorded in current earnings 
generally  the changes in fair value of such non dealer related derivatives  excluding those that qualify for hedge accounting  are recorded in realized investment gains losses  net 
for additional information regarding the impact of changes in fair value of derivative instruments on our results of operations see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses below 
we hold externally managed investments in the european market  as discussed in greater detail under realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities asset backed securities 
these investments are valued using market observable inputs including benchmark yields and reported trades and are classified as level for fair value reporting 
the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with these investments declined in due to increased credit spreads in the applicable financial markets  and as of december  remains in a loss position on a cumulative basis as a result of the recent stress in the credit markets 
however  we believe the investment fundamentals remain sound  and the ultimate value that will be realized from these investments is greater than reflected by the current fair value of the embedded derivatives 
valuation of variable annuity optional living benefit features our liability for future policy benefits includes general account liabilities for guarantees on variable annuity contracts  including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits gmiwb 
while these guarantees primarily relate to the optional living benefit features of our individual annuities segment  they are also included in certain variable annuities in our international insurance segment and certain retirement account based group variable annuities in our retirement segment 
these benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in realized investment gains losses  net 
the fair values of the gmab  gmwb and gmiwb liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature 
the expected cash flows are discounted using forward libor interest rates  which are commonly viewed as being consistent with our claims paying ratings of aa quality 
since insurance liabilities are senior to debt  we believe that reflecting our claims paying ratings in the valuation of the liability appropriately takes into consideration our own risk of nonperformance 
since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations  the valuations are calculated using internally developed models with option pricing techniques 
the models calculate a risk neutral valuation  generally using the same interest rate assumptions to both project and discount future rider fees and benefit payments  and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques  inputs  and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows 
significant inputs to these models include capital market assumptions  such as interest rate and implied volatility assumptions  as well as various policyholder behavior assumptions that are actuarially determined  including lapse rates  benefit utilization rates  mortality rates and withdrawal rates 
these assumptions are reviewed at least annually  and updated based upon historical experience and give consideration to any observable market data  including market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions 
since many of the assumptions utilized are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the liability valuation  the liability included in future policy benefits has been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
the change in fair value of the gmab  gmwb and gmiwb resulted in an increase in the total liability of billion for the year ended december  this change was significantly offset by changes in value of related hedging instruments  primarily in our individual annuities segment as described in more detail under results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
valuation of other assets and other liabilities other assets carried at fair value include us treasury bills held within our global commodities group whose fair values are determined consistent with similar securities described above under valuation of fixed maturity securities 
included in other liabilities are various derivatives contracts executed within our global commodities group  including exchange traded futures  foreign currency and commodity contracts 
the fair values of these derivative instruments are determined consistent with similar derivative instruments described above under valuation of derivative instruments 
valuation of trading account assets trading account assets  including trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  consist primarily of public corporate bonds  treasuries  equity securities and derivatives whose fair values are determined consistent with similar instruments described above in valuation of fixed maturity securities  valuation of equity securities and valuation of derivative instruments 
valuation of cash equivalents and short term investments cash equivalents and short term investments carried at fair value include money market instruments  commercial paper and other highly liquid debt instruments 
money market instruments are generally valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to us for identical assets and are primarily classified as level the remaining instruments in the cash equivalents and short term investments category are typically not traded in active markets  however  their fair values are based on market observable inputs and  accordingly  these investments have been classified within level in our fair value hierarchy 
realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources  including the sale of fixed maturity securities  equity securities  investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships and other types of investments  as well as adjustments to the cost basis of investments for other than temporary impairments 
realized investment gains and losses are also generated from prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity securities  recoveries of principal on previously impaired securities  provisions for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans  fair value changes on commercial mortgage operations loans  fair value changes on embedded derivatives and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  except those derivatives used in our capacity as a broker or dealer 
we perform quarterly impairment reviews to determine when a decline in value is other than temporary 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent and duration of the decline in value  the reasons for the decline credit event  currency  or interest rate related  including general credit spread widening  our ability and intent to hold our investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment  we write down the value of the security to its fair value  with a corresponding charge recorded in realized investment gains losses  net 
historically  the causes of other than temporary impairments have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region 
however  as discussed in more detail below  certain of the other than temporary impairments recognized for the years ended december  and resulted from broad market concerns over the sub prime mortgage market  and liquidity concerns 
in addition  for our impairment review of asset backed securities with a credit rating below aa  we forecast our best estimate of the prospective future cash flows of the security to determine if the present value of those cash flows  discounted using the effective yield of the most recent interest accrual rate  has decreased from the previous reporting period 
when a decrease from the prior reporting period has occurred and the security s fair value is less than its carrying value  an other than temporary impairment is recognized by writing the security down to fair value 
given recent market conditions and liquidity concerns  beginning in the third quarter of  our determinations of whether a decline in value is other than temporary have placed greater emphasis on our internal analysis of the underlying credit and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  versus the extent and duration of a decline in fair value 
for a further discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording fixed maturity other than temporary impairments  see general account investments fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities below 
for a further discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording equity impairments  see general account investments equity securities other than temporary impairments of equity securities below 
the level of other than temporary impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve 
we may realize additional credit and interest rate related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives 
in light of the unprecedented current market conditions  and in consideration of the potential impact on capital and tax positions  beginning in the fourth quarter of we temporarily curtailed the active trading policy of certain portfolios  and are currently evaluating our going forward trading strategies 
other than temporary impairments  interest rate related losses and credit losses other than those related to certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors are excluded from adjusted operating income 
in periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment  the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment 
accordingly  the discount or reduced premium based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment income  and included in adjusted operating income in future periods based upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows of the security  if the recoverable value of the investment  based upon cash flows we can reasonably estimate  is greater than the carrying value of the investment after the impairment 
we require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities 
prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as well as the interest rate environment 
we use interest and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities  including duration mismatches 
we use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce us dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non us businesses 
we also use equity based derivatives to hedge the equity risks embedded in some of our annuity products 
derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to be announced mortgage backed securities primarily related to our mortgage dollar roll program 
many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  and  consequently  we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings  although we do not necessarily account for the related assets or liabilities the same way 
accordingly  realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income 
adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains losses  net  other than those representing profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors  and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings  current period yield adjustments  or product derivatives and the effect of any related economic hedging program and related charges and adjustments

partially offsetting these gains were net mark to market losses of million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally managed investments in the european market and net losses of million on embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity contracts 
net mark to market gains on interest rate derivatives used to manage duration includes the impact of long duration floating to fixed interest rate swaps we entered into in order to add duration exposure to our japanese investment portfolio 
based on an evaluation of recent market conditions  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into  we have terminated or offset many of these interest rate swaps in consideration of  among other things  the interest rate environment  thereby monetizing a portion of the mark to market gains

in certain of these circumstances the decrease in fair value  at the time the impairment was recorded  was partially driven by general credit spread widening or liquidity concerns and we believe the recoverable value of the investment  based on the expected future cash flows  is greater than the current fair value 
includes certain circumstances relating to asset backed securities with a credit rating below aa  where the present value of prospective cash flows of the security have declined  but we do not believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment 
also includes circumstances where we cannot assert our ability or intent to hold for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value

general account investments we maintain a diversified investment portfolio in our insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our financial services businesses and the closed block business  as well as our other general liabilities 
our general account does not include assets of our brokerage  trading and banking operations  real estate and relocation services  and assets of our asset management operations  including assets managed for third parties  and those assets classified as separate account assets on our balance sheet 
the general account portfolio is managed pursuant to the distinct objectives of the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
the primary investment objectives of the financial services businesses include matching the liability characteristics of the major products and other obligations of the company  maximizing the portfolio book yield within risk constraints  and for certain portfolios  maximizing total return  including both investment yield and capital gains  and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of their major products 
our strategies for maximizing the portfolio book yield of the financial services businesses include the investment of proceeds from investment sales  repayments and prepayments  and operating cash flows  into optimally yielding investments  and where appropriate  the sale of the portfolio s lower yielding investments  either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio s duration  credit  currency and other risk constraints  all while minimizing the amount of taxes on realized capital gains 
the primary investment objectives of the closed block business include providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block business and the class b shareholders  and maximizing total return and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of the major products in the closed block business 
in light of recent market and economic conditions  while we continue to look to maximize book yield and match the liability characteristics of our major products  our portfolio management approach now reflects a greater consideration of the capital and tax implications of portfolio activity  as well as our assertion on our ability and intent to hold securities to recovery 
in consideration of the potential impact on capital and tax positions  beginning in the fourth quarter of we temporarily curtailed the active trading policy previously employed in the closed block business and certain portfolios of the financial services businesses  and are currently evaluating our going forward trading strategies for these portfolios 
for a further discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary impairments  including our assertions on our ability and intent to hold securities to recovery  see fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities and equity securities other than temporary impairments of equity securities  below 
management of investments we design asset mix strategies for our general account to match the characteristics of our products and other obligations and seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity  but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics  of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
in certain markets  primarily outside the us  capital market limitations hinder our ability to closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities 
we achieve income objectives through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocations within a disciplined risk management framework 
for a discussion of our risk management process see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments  and other than trading activities insurance and annuity products asset liability management 
our asset allocation also reflects our desire for broad diversification across asset classes  sectors and issuers 
the asset management segment manages virtually all of our investments  other than those managed by our international insurance segment  under the direction and oversight of the asset liability management and risk management groups 
our international insurance segment manages the majority of its investments locally  in some cases using the international asset management capabilities of our international investments segment 
the investment committee of our board of directors oversees our proprietary investments 
it also reviews performance and risk positions quarterly 
our asset liability management and risk management groups develop the investment policy for the general account assets of our insurance subsidiaries  oversee the investment process for our general account and have the authority to initiate tactical shifts within exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee 
the asset liability management and risk management groups work closely with each of our business units to ensure that the specific characteristics of our products are incorporated into their processes and to develop investment objectives  including performance factors and measures and asset allocation ranges 
we adjust this dynamic process as products change  as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur 
we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus  each with distinct risk characteristics 
most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes interest crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience  such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance  participating individual and experience rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends  interest or return of premium  and guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract  such as gics 
we determine a target asset mix for each product class  which we reflect in our investment policies 
our asset liability management process has permitted us to manage interest sensitive products successfully through several market cycles 
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans  equity securities and other invested assets 
the composition of our general account reflects  within the discipline provided by our risk management approach  our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our asset management segment

commercial mortgage backed securities weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals  along with a decrease in the overall liquidity and availability of capital have led to a very difficult refinancing environment and an increase in the overall delinquency rate on commercial mortgages in the commercial mortgage backed securities market 
difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the overall economic downturn continue to put additional pressure on these fundamentals through rising vacancies  falling rents and falling property values 
in addition  we have recognized several market factors related to commercial mortgage backed securities issued in and  including less stringent underwriting  higher levels of leverage and collateral valuations that are generally no longer realizable 
to ensure our investment objectives and asset strategies are maintained  we consider these market factors in making our investment decisions on securities in these vintages

us commercial mortgage backed securities subordination percentages by rating and vintage financial services businesses vintage december  lowest rating agency rating aaa aa a bbb bb and below prior non us commercial mortgage backed securities subordination percentages by rating and vintage financial services businesses vintage december  lowest rating agency rating aaa aa a bbb bb and below prior the super senior structure was introduced to the us commercial mortgage backed securities market in late and was modified in early to increase subordination from to 
with the changes to the commercial mortgage backed securities structure in  there became three distinct aaa classes for commercial mortgage backed securities with fixed rate terms  super senior aaa with subordination  mezzanine aaa with subordination and junior aaa with approximately subordination 
the super senior class has priority over the mezzanine and junior classes to all principal cashflows repayments  prepayments and recoveries on defaulted loans 
as a result  all super senior bonds must be completely repaid before the mezzanine or junior bonds receive any principal cashflows 
in addition  the super senior bonds will not experience any loss of principal until both the entire mezzanine and junior bonds are written down to zero 
we believe the importance of this additional credit enhancement afforded to the super senior class over the mezzanine and junior classes is limited in a benign commercial real estate cycle with low defaults but becomes more significant in a deep commercial real estate downturn under which expected losses increase substantially 
in addition to enhanced subordination  certain securities within the super senior class benefit from the prioritization of principal cash flows 
the super senior class is generally structured such that shorter duration time tranches have priority over longer duration time tranches as to all principal cashflows repayments  prepayments  and recoveries on defaulted loans until the deal reaches cumulative net loss  at which point all super senior securities are paid pro rata 
as a result  short of reaching cumulative net losses  the shorter duration super senior tranches must be completely repaid before the longest duration super senior tranche receives any principal cashflows 
we have generally focused our purchases of recent vintage commercial mortgage backed securities on shorter duration super senior tranches that we believe have sufficient priority to ensure that in most scenarios our positions will be fully repaid prior to the structure reaching the cumulative net loss threshold

the loan to value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan  and is commonly expressed as a percentage 
loan to value ratios greater than percent indicate that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value 
therefore  all else being equal  a smaller loan to value ratio generally indicates a higher quality security 
the debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to its debt service payments 
debt service coverage ratios less than times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover its current debt payments

fixed maturity securities credit quality the securities valuation office  or svo  of the naic  evaluates the investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called naic designations 
naic designations of or include fixed maturities considered investment grade  which include securities rated baa or higher by moody s or bbb or higher by standard poor s 
naic designations of through are referred to as below investment grade  which include securities rated ba or lower by moody s and bb or lower by standard poor s 
as a result of time lags between the funding of investments  the finalization of legal documents and the completion of the svo filing process  the fixed maturity portfolio generally includes securities that have not yet been rated by the svo as of each balance sheet date

credit derivative exposure to public fixed maturities in addition to the credit exposure from public fixed maturities noted above  we sell credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments 
in a credit derivative we sell credit protection on an identified name  or a basket of names in a first to default structure  and in return receive a quarterly premium

the declines in fair value were primarily due to general credit spread widening in the structured credit marketplace and increased liquidity discounts  and we believe the recoverable value of these investments based on the expected future cash flows is greater than or equal to our amortized cost  and we have the ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value 
see other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities we maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management 
our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
for private placements our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management 
we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish checks and balances for new investments 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions  whether they originate through our own in house origination staff or through agents 
our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions 
we set all valuation standards centrally  and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly 
our private fixed maturity asset managers formally review all private fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are those securities where we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity 
these securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statements of financial position 
other fixed maturity securities are considered available for sale  and  as a result  we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value 
all held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent and the duration of the decline  including  but not limited to  the following general guidelines  declines in value greater than  maintained for six months or greater  declines in value greater than  maintained for more than one year on below investment grade bonds  and declines in value less than six months where there has been a precipitous generally or greater decline in value  the reasons for the decline in value credit event  currency or interest rate related  including general credit spread widening  our ability and intent to hold our investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  including certain debt securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
given recent market conditions and liquidity concerns  and the resulting historically wide bid ask spreads and high levels of price volatility  the extent and duration of a decline in value have become less indicative of when the market may believe there has been credit deterioration with respect to an issuer 
considering these current conditions  and in light of general guidance from the sec and the fasb regarding the application of existing guidance during stressed market conditions  beginning in the third quarter of our determinations of whether a decline in value is other than temporary have placed greater emphasis on our analysis of the underlying credit versus the extent and duration of a decline in value 
our credit analysis of an investment includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments  evaluating whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  and determining whether we can assert our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value 
we continue to utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration  and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity and duration of the decline increases 
for those securities that have declines in value that are deemed to be temporary  we have asserted our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery 
once identified as such  these securities are restricted from trading unless authorized based upon events that could not have been foreseen at the time we asserted our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery 
examples of such events include  but are not limited to  the deterioration of the issuer s creditworthiness  a major business combination or disposition  a change in regulatory requirements  certain other portfolio actions or other similar events 
for those securities that have declines in value for which we cannot assert our ability and intent to retain until recovery  including certain debt securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  impairments are recognized as other than temporary regardless of the reason for  or the extent of  the decline 
in addition  for our impairment review of asset backed fixed maturity securities with a credit rating below aa  we forecast our best estimate of the prospective future cash flows of the security to determine if the present value of those cash flows  discounted using the effective yield of the most recent interest accrual rate  has decreased from the previous reporting period 
when a decrease from the prior reporting period has occurred and the security s fair value is less than its carrying value  an other than temporary impairment is recognized by writing the security down to fair value 
when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment  we record a writedown to estimated fair value  which reduces the cost basis 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
in periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment  the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment 
accordingly  the discount or reduced premium based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment income  and included in adjusted operating income in future periods based upon the amount and timing of the expected future cash flows of the security  if the recoverable value of the investment based on those cash flows is greater than the carrying value of the investment after the impairment 
impairments on fixed maturity securities are included in realized investment gains losses  net and are excluded from adjusted operating income

all loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending

uncollateralized loans primarily represent consumer loans extended by gibraltar life to individuals for financing purchases of consumer goods and services  which are guaranteed by third party guarantor companies 
composition of commercial mortgage loans the stress experienced in the global financial markets and unfavorable credit market conditions that began in the second half of and continued and substantially increased throughout led to a decrease in the overall liquidity and availability of capital in the commercial mortgage loan market  and in particular a decrease in activity by securitization lenders 
these conditions have led to greater opportunities for more selective originations by portfolio lenders such as our general account 
while we have begun to observe some weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals  delinquency rates on our commercial mortgage loans have been relatively stable in recent years 
however  continued difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the overall economic downturn could put additional pressure on these fundamentals through rising vacancies  falling rents and falling property values 
our commercial mortgage loan portfolio strategy emphasizes diversification by property type and geographic location

the loan to value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan  and is commonly expressed as a percentage 
loan to value ratios greater than percent indicate that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value 
therefore  all else being equal  a smaller loan to value ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan 
the debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to its debt service payments 
debt service coverage ratios less than times indicates that property operations do not generate enough income to cover its current debt payments 
therefore  all else being equal  a larger debt service coverage ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan 
as of december   our general account investments in commercial mortgage loans attributable to the financial services businesses had a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of times  and a weighted average loan to value ratio of 
as of december   our general account investments in commercial mortgage loans attributable to the closed block business had a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of times  and a weighted average loan to value ratio of 
for those general account commercial mortgage loans attributable to the financial services businesses that were originated in  the weighted average loan to value ratio was  and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was above times  both consistent with originations over the last several years 
the total portfolio loan to value ratios are lower than our origination loan to value ratio due to principal payments on the loan balances and appreciation of the underlying collateral value 
the values utilized in calculating these loan to value ratios are developed as part of our periodic review of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio  which includes a quality re rating as well as an internal evaluation of the underlying collateral value 
for loans with collateral under construction  renovation or lease up  a stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan to value and debt service coverage ratios

we place loans on early warning status in cases where we detect that the physical condition of the property  the financial situation of the borrower or tenant or other market factors could lead to a loss of principal or interest 
we classify loans as closely monitored when there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that will lead to a potential loss of principal or interest 
loans not in good standing are those loans where there is a high probability of loss of principal  such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy 
in our domestic operations  our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list 
as described below  in determining our allowance for losses we evaluate each loan on the watch list to determine if it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
in our international portfolios  we monitor delinquency in consumer loans on a pool basis and evaluate any servicing relationship and guarantees the same way we do for commercial mortgage loans 
we establish an allowance for losses to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in the lending process 
the allowance includes loan specific reserves for loans that are determined to be non performing as a result of our loan review process  and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses 
we define a non performing loan as a loan for which it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
the loan specific portion is based on our assessment as to ultimate collectability of loan principal and interest 
valuation allowances for a non performing loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers our past loan experience  the current credit composition of the portfolio  historical credit migration  property type diversification  default and loss severity statistics and other relevant factors 
we record increases or decreases to our valuation allowances when appropriate

the following table sets forth the cost and gross unrealized losses of our equity securities attributable to the closed block business where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by less than for the following timeframes unrealized losses from equity securities  less than closed block business december  december  cost gross unrealized losses cost gross unrealized losses in millions less than three months three months or greater but less than six months six months or greater but less than nine months nine months or greater but less than twelve months greater than twelve months total the aging of amortized cost and gross unrealized losses is determined based upon a count of the number of months the estimated fair value remained below cost by less than  using month end valuations 
the following table sets forth the cost and gross unrealized losses of our equity securities attributable to the closed block business where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by or more for the following timeframes unrealized losses from equity securities  greater than closed block business december  december  cost gross unrealized losses cost gross unrealized losses in millions less than three months three months or greater but less than six months six months or greater but less than nine months nine months or greater but less than twelve months greater than twelve months total the aging of amortized cost and gross unrealized losses is determined based upon a count of the number of months the estimated fair value remained below cost by or more  using month end valuations 
as of december  includes million of gross unrealized losses on securities with a cost of million where the estimated fair value had declined below cost by or more 
the gross unrealized losses as of december  were primarily concentrated in the manufacturing  finance  and service sectors compared to december  where the gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in the finance and services sectors 
gross unrealized losses attributable to the closed block business where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by or more of million as of december  includes million of gross unrealized losses on securities with a cost of million where the estimated fair value had declined below cost by or more  of which million was included in the less than three month timeframe  million was included in the three months or greater but less than six months timeframe  and million was included in the six months or greater but less than nine months timeframe 
we have not recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in the table above as other than temporary impairments 
see impairments of equity securities for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations 
other than temporary impairments of equity securities for those equity securities classified as available for sale we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent cost is different from estimated fair value 
all securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent and the duration of the decline  including  but not limited to  the following general guidelines  declines in value greater than  maintained for six months or greater  declines in value maintained for one year or greater  and declines in value greater than  the reasons for the decline in value issuer specific event  currency or market fluctuation  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
given recent market conditions and liquidity concerns  and the resulting high levels of price volatility  and in light of general guidance from the sec and the fasb regarding the application of existing guidance during stressed market conditions  beginning in the third quarter of we extended the parameters under which we consider a decline in value to be other than temporary 
in particular  we generally recognize other than temporary impairments for securities with declines in value greater than maintained for six months or greater or with any decline in value maintained for one year or greater 
in addition  in making our determinations we continue to analyze the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including an assessment of the issuer s capital position  and consider our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value 
for those securities that have declines in value that are deemed to be only temporary  we make an assertion as to our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery 
once identified  these securities are restricted from trading unless authorized based upon events that could not have been foreseen at the time we asserted our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery 
examples of such events include  but are not limited to  the deterioration of the issuer s creditworthiness  a major business combination or disposition  a change in regulatory requirements  certain other portfolio actions or other similar events 
for those securities that have declines in value for which we cannot assert our ability and intent to retain until recovery  including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  impairments are recognized as other than temporary regardless of the reason for  or the extent of  the decline 
for perpetual preferred securities  which have characteristics of both debt and equity securities  we apply an impairment model similar to our fixed maturity securities 
for additional discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities  see fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities above 
when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment  we record a writedown to estimated fair value  which reduces the cost basis 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
estimated fair values for publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent pricing services 
estimated fair values for privately traded equity securities are determined using valuation and discounted cash flow models that require a substantial level of judgment 
in determining the fair value of certain privately traded equity securities the discounted cash flow model may also use unobservable inputs  which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset 
impairments on equity securities are included in realized investment gains losses  net and are excluded from adjusted operating income

liquidity and capital resources extraordinary market conditions and their impact on our liquidity and capital resources beginning in the latter half of and continuing into  severe dislocations in the credit and capital markets  initially driven by broad market concerns over the impact of sub prime mortgage holdings of financial institutions  generally resulted in reduced availability and increased cost of credit for financial institutions in the marketplace  including prudential financial and its subsidiaries 
these dislocations accelerated following the failure  consolidation  or us federal government intervention on behalf of several significant financial institutions 
during the fourth quarter of  the volatility and disruptions in the credit and capital markets reached unprecedented levels  adversely affecting the global economy  particularly in the financial services industry 
the us federal government  as well as governments in many countries in which we operate  have taken or are considering taking actions in order to address this financial market dislocation 
this market dislocation has adversely impacted our liquidity and capital plans  results of operations  and financial position 
for example  the term credit markets for debt and hybrid securities have generally been closed to all financial institutions  including prudential financial 
in addition  our commercial paper programs have experienced an increase in the cost of funding 
the market conditions also negatively impacted the level of capital in our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries  as a result of asset value declines and the need to strengthen reserves  particularly in our annuity businesses 
as a consequence of the market dislocation and in order to manage our liquidity and capital resources  we undertook certain actions during the fourth quarter of  including the following suspended all repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program  reduced the common stock dividend by approximately percent from the amount  redeployed certain assets to our insurance subsidiaries from our non insurance subsidiaries such as the subsidiary that holds our minority interest in our wachovia securities joint venture  announced our intention to exercise our right under the lookback option to put our wachovia securities joint venture interest to wells fargo  drew billion of collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york  participated in the commercial paper funding facility sponsored by the federal reserve bank of new york  applied to participate in the us treasury s capital purchase program under the troubled asset relief program  or tarp  implemented certain other actions  including accelerating loan repayments to prudential financial by our asset management businesses  to strengthen our cash position in anticipation of the repurchase in june of our floating rate convertible debt issued in december  as further described in financing activities below  and ceased the sale of certain annuity products 
these actions enabled us to maintain capital at december  consistent with our ratings objectives  and to maintain sufficient liquidity and capital flexibility 
we will make capital contributions to our international insurance operations in japan during the first quarter of totaling approximately million 
in the event that market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to make further capital contributions to our domestic or international regulated subsidiaries 
the company continues to operate with significant cash on the balance sheet and has access to alternate sources of liquidity  as discussed in alternative sources of liquidity 
however  a continuation or worsening of the disruptions in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect prudential financial and its subsidiaries ability to access sources of liquidity  as well as threaten to reduce our capital below a level that is consistent with our existing ratings objectives 
therefore  we may need to take additional actions beyond those described above  which may include but are not limited to additional capital management activities  further access to our alternative sources of liquidity  accelerating or restructuring loans extended to affiliates  access to external sources of capital  including the debt or equity markets  limiting or curtailing sales of certain products and or restructuring existing products  undertaking asset sales  and seeking temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules 
certain of these actions may require regulatory approval 
management monitors the liquidity of prudential financial and the company on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi year time horizon through our quarterly planning process 
we believe that cash flows from the sources of funds presently available to us are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of prudential financial  including reasonably foreseeable contingencies 
prudential financial the principal sources of funds available to prudential financial  the parent holding company and registrant  to meet its obligations  including the payment of shareholder dividends  share repurchases  debt service  operating expenses  capital contributions and obligations to subsidiaries  are dividends  returns of capital  interest income from its subsidiaries  and cash and short term investments 
these sources of funds may be supplemented by prudential financial s access to the capital markets and bank facilities  as well as the alternative sources of liquidity described below 
as of december   prudential financial had cash and short term investments of billion  a decrease of million from december  included in the cash and short term investments of prudential financial is million held in an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to maximize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between prudential financial and its affiliates on a daily basis 
short term investments comprise million of prudential financial s total cash and short term investments and consist primarily of government agency securities and money market funds 
prudential financial s principal sources and uses of cash and short term investments for the year ended december  were as follows year ended december  in millions sources dividends and or returns of capital from subsidiaries proceeds from the issuance of retail medium term notes  net of repayments proceeds from the issuance of junior subordinated debt hybrid securities proceeds from short term debt  net of repayments proceeds from stock based compensation and exercise of stock options net receipts under intercompany loan agreements total sources uses capital contributions to subsidiaries share repurchases shareholder dividends repayment of long term senior debt  net of issuances repayment of floating rate convertible senior notes purchase of funding agreements from prudential insurance  net of maturities other  net total uses net decrease in cash and short term investments includes dividends and or returns of capital of billion from prudential insurance  million from asset management subsidiaries  million from international insurance and investments subsidiaries  million from prudential annuities life assurance corporation  million from securities subsidiaries and million from other subsidiaries

see uses of capital share repurchases 
sources of capital prudential financial is a holding company whose principal asset is its investments in subsidiaries 
we believe prudential financial s capitalization and use of financial leverage are consistent with its ratings targets 
our long term senior debt credit rating targets for prudential financial are a for standard poor s rating services  or s p  moody s investors service  inc  or moody s  and fitch ratings ltd  or fitch  and a for am best company  or am best 
our financial strength rating targets for our domestic life insurance companies are aa aa aa for s p  moody s and fitch  respectively  and a for am best 
for our current ratings information see business ratings 
we seek to capitalize all of our subsidiaries and businesses in accordance with their credit ratings targets 
as discussed in more detail in business ratings  in late september and early october am best  fitch  moody s  and s p each revised its outlook for the us life insurance sector to negative from stable 
rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions  have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews  have requested additional information from the companies that they rate  and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 
in addition  actions we take to access third party financing  as discussed below  may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  rating agencies took certain steps with respect to prudential financial and its subsidiaries 
refer to business ratings for more details 
a downgrade in the credit or financial strength ie  claims paying ratings of prudential financial or its rated subsidiaries could potentially  among other things  limit our ability to market products  reduce our competitiveness  increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals  increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds  adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees  such as letters of credit  cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements and or hurt our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties 
additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements 
a ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels at december  would result in estimated collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately million 
in addition  a ratings downgrade by am best to a for our domestic life insurance companies would require prudential insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of billion that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately million  or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust 
we believe that the posting of such collateral would not be a material liquidity event for prudential insurance 
the primary components of capitalization for the financial services businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the financial services businesses excluding accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension and postretirement benefits  outstanding junior subordinated debt and outstanding capital debt of the financial services businesses  as discussed below under financing activities 
based on these components  the capital position of the financial services businesses as of december  was as follows december  in millions attributed equity excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension postretirement benefits junior subordinated debt hybrid securities capital debt total capital our capital debt to total capital ratio was as of december  the ratio reflects that the hybrid securities we issued are attributed equity credit  with the remaining treated as capital debt 
as shown in the table above  as of december   the financial services businesses had approximately billion in capital  all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its corporate and other operations 
based on our assessments of these businesses and operations  we believe this level of capital was consistent with our aa ratings objectives as of december  in response to the market dislocation affecting the banking system and financial markets  on october   president bush signed the emergency economic stabilization act of  or eesa  into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets 
on october   the us treasury announced that it would use eesa authority to invest an aggregate of billion of the first billion released under eesa in capital issued by qualifying us financial institutions under the us treasury s capital purchase program  which is part of the troubled asset relief program  or tarp 
the tarp capital purchase program involves the issuance by qualifying institutions of preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to the us treasury 
concurrently  in coordination with the us treasury  the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guarantee program  through which it guarantees certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by fdic insured institutions and their qualifying holding companies  as well as funds over  in non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts 
in addition  since march  the federal reserve has created several lending facilities to stabilize financial markets 
most recently on november   the federal reserve announced the term asset backed securities loan facility  or talf 
the talf has not yet been finalized but is designed to provide secured financing for newly issued asset backed securities backed by certain types of consumer and small business loans 
on february   the us treasury announced a financial stability plan to build upon existing programs and earmark the second billion of funds that were authorized under the eesa and released in january the elements of the financial stability plan  as described by the us treasury  are a capital assistance program and financial stability trust to make capital available to financial institutions through additional purchases of preferred stock  a public private investment fund to buy legacy loans and assets from financial institutions  a consumer and business lending initiative to restart securitization markets for loans to consumers and businesses by expanding upon talf  and a comprehensive housing program to  among other things  help reduce mortgage payments and interest rates 
the us treasury has stated that the financial stability plan will require high levels of transparency and accountability standards and dividend  acquisition and executive compensation restrictions for financial institutions that receive government assistance going forward 
we have applied to participate in the capital purchase program  although no determination with respect to our participation has been made 
we continue to evaluate other government sponsored programs for which we may be eligible 
in addition to the foregoing  the us federal government has taken or is considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis 
we cannot predict with any certainty whether these actions will be effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets  or on our businesses  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
uses of capital share repurchases in november  prudential financial s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase at management s discretion up to billion of its outstanding common stock in calendar year in light of recent market volatility and extraordinary events and developments affecting financial markets generally  including market conditions for issuance of certain capital instruments such as hybrid securities  we suspended all purchases of our common stock under the stock repurchase program effective october  for the year ended december   prior to the suspension of the program  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a total cost of billion 
we do not anticipate reinstituting a share repurchase program in shareholder dividends on november   prudential financial declared an annual dividend for of cents per share of common stock  payable on december   to shareholders of record at the close of business on november  the common stock declared dividend represents a decrease of approximately percent from the common stock dividend 
restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries our insurance and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to affiliates 
with respect to prudential insurance  new jersey insurance law provides that  except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions  all dividends or distributions paid by prudential insurance may be declared or paid only from unassigned surplus  as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles  less unrealized investment gains and losses and revaluation of assets 
as of december  and  prudential insurance s unassigned surplus was billion and billion  respectively 
prudential insurance recorded applicable adjustments for cumulative unrealized investment gains of million and billion  as of december  and  respectively 
prudential insurance must also notify the new jersey department of banking and insurance of its intent to pay a dividend or distribution 
if the dividend or distribution  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds a specified statutory limit it is considered an extraordinary dividend or distribution and prudential insurance must obtain the prior non disapproval of the department 
the current statutory limitation applicable to new jersey life insurers is generally the greater of of the prior calendar year s statutory surplus  billion as of december   or the prior calendar year s statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses  million for the year ended december  in addition to these regulatory limitations  the terms of the ihc debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by prudential insurance applicable to the financial services businesses in the event the closed block business is in financial distress and under certain other circumstances 
in the second quarter of  prudential insurance declared an ordinary dividend of million and an extraordinary dividend of million to prudential holdings  llc 
these dividends were paid to prudential holdings in the second quarter of and in turn distributed to prudential financial 
our ability to pay an ordinary dividend in is contingent upon market conditions and other factors 
the laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar  but not identical  to new jersey s 
pursuant to gibraltar life s reorganization  in addition to regulatory restrictions  there are certain other restrictions on gibraltar life s ability to pay dividends to prudential financial 
we anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow gibraltar life to pay such dividends 
there are also regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by the prudential life insurance company  ltd  or prudential of japan  which began paying dividends in further  current market conditions have impacted capital positions of our international insurance companies  which could further restrict their ability to pay dividends 
the ability of our asset management subsidiaries  and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries  to pay dividends is largely unrestricted 
see liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries below for additional details on the liquidity of our domestic insurance subsidiaries  international insurance subsidiaries and asset management subsidiaries 
alternative sources of liquidity prudential financial maintains an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to maximize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between the parent holding company and its affiliates on a daily basis 
depending on the overall availability of cash  the parent holding company invests excess cash on a short term basis or borrows funds in the capital markets 
additional longer term liquidity is available through inter affiliate borrowing arrangements 
prudential financial and certain of its subsidiaries also have access to bank facilities  as discussed under lines of credit and other credit facilities  as well as the other alternative sources of liquidity described below 
commercial paper programs prudential financial has a commercial paper program rated a by s p  p by moody s and f by fitch with a current authorized capacity of billion 
prudential financial commercial paper borrowings are generally used to fund the working capital needs of prudential financial s subsidiaries and provide short term liquidity at prudential financial 
prudential financial s outstanding commercial paper borrowings were billion as of december   a decrease of million from december  as of december   the vast majority of this commercial paper was either held in cash or invested in short term financial instruments 
the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
prudential funding  llc  or prudential funding  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential insurance  has a commercial paper program  rated a by s p  p by moody s and f by fitch with a current authorized capacity of billion 
prudential funding s outstanding commercial paper and master note borrowings were billion as of december   a decrease of billion from december  due to a combination of lower investor demand and increased funding costs 
as of december   billion of this outstanding commercial paper was funding short term financial instruments  including a portion of our enhanced short term portfolio which is discussed in more detail below under asset based financing  and the remainder was primarily utilized to fund short term cash flow timing mismatches and the working capital needs of our affiliates 
the weighted average interest rates on these borrowings were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
prudential financial has issued a subordinated guarantee covering prudential funding s domestic commercial paper program 
during the latter half of and continuing through  the credit markets  and specifically the commercial paper market  were adversely impacted by concerns over the sub prime mortgage exposure of certain financial institutions and asset backed commercial paper programs 
due to continued dislocation within the financial markets  the challenges in the commercial paper market intensified in the fourth quarter of as a result  the financing cost of prudential financial commercial paper increased versus its historical cost basis relative to the target federal funds rate as investors demanded a premium for such top tier split rated commercial paper 
the financing cost of prudential funding commercial paper increased as well versus its historical cost basis relative to the target federal funds rate over the same period 
both prudential financial s and prudential funding s commercial paper programs were granted approval to participate in the federal reserve s commercial paper funding facility  or cpff  during the fourth quarter of the cpff is intended to improve liquidity in short term funding markets by increasing the availability of term commercial paper funding to issuers and by providing greater assurance to both issuers and investors that firms will be able to roll over their maturing commercial paper 
our commercial paper must maintain ratings of at least a p f by at least two rating agencies in order to be eligible for the program 
unsecured commercial paper issued under the cpff will be discounted based on a rate equal to a spread basis points over the three month overnight index swap rate on the day of purchase 
access to the cpff for the issuance of new commercial paper is scheduled to terminate on october   unless such date is extended by the federal reserve 
prudential funding is eligible to sell to the cpff three month unsecured us dollar denominated commercial paper up to a maximum of billion  less the outstanding amount of any non cpff commercial paper at the applicable time 
as of december   prudential funding had million of commercial paper outstanding under the cpff  with a weighted average maturity of days 
excluding commercial paper issued under cpff  prudential funding s outstanding commercial paper as of december  had a weighted average maturity of days and approximately was overnight 
as of the date of this filing  prudential funding had approximately million outstanding under cpff 
on february   the commercial paper credit rating of prudential financial was downgraded by fitch from f to f  as described further in business ratings 
consequently  prudential financial will no longer be eligible to issue commercial paper under the cpff 
as of december   prudential financial had million of commercial paper outstanding under the cpff  with a weighted average maturity of days 
excluding commercial paper issued under cpff  prudential financial s outstanding commercial paper as of december  had a weighted average maturity of days and approximately was overnight 
as of the date of this filing  prudential financial had approximately million outstanding under cpff 
we continue to monitor market conditions and believe we have sufficient flexibility to reduce our borrowings under the prudential financial and prudential funding commercial paper programs  if needed  through our alternative sources of liquidity  as discussed in this section 
both commercial paper programs are backed by our unsecured committed lines of credit 
as of december   prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling billion 
there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of december  for a further discussion of lines of credit  see lines of credit and other credit facilities 
asset based financing we conduct asset based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries  including transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements  in order to earn spread income  to borrow funds  or to facilitate trading activity 
these programs are driven by portfolio holdings in securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace 
the collateral received in connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short term spread portfolios of our domestic insurance entities 
investments held in the short term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and fixed maturities  including mortgage and asset backed securities  with a weighted average life at time of purchase of two years or less 
a portion of the asset backed securities held in our short term spread portfolios  including our enhanced short term portfolio  are collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities for a further discussion of our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime holdings  including details regarding those securities held in our enhanced short term portfolio 
these short term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements  which among other things  do not allow for significant asset liability interest rate duration mismatch 
as of december   our financial services businesses had liabilities totaling billion under such programs  including billion representing securities sold under agreements to repurchase  billion representing cash collateral for loaned securities and million representing securities sold but not yet purchased 
of the billion for the financial services businesses as of december   billion represents securities that may be returned to the company overnight requiring immediate return of the cash collateral  and the remainder has maturities ranging from days to months with a weighted average maturity of days 
as of december   our closed block business had liabilities totaling billion under such programs  including billion representing securities sold under agreements to repurchase and billion representing cash collateral for loaned securities 
of the billion for the closed block business as of december   billion represents securities that may be returned to the company overnight requiring immediate return of the cash collateral  and the remainder has maturities ranging from days to months with a weighted average maturity of days 
as of december   our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the lending program of billion  of which billion were on loan 
taking into account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of december   we believe approximately billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable 
further changes in market conditions can affect the ability to lend the available assets 
as referenced above  these programs are typically limited to securities in demand that can be loaned at relatively low financing rates 
as such  we believe there is unused capacity available through these programs 
holdings of cash and cash equivalent investments in these short term spread portfolios allow for further flexibility in sizing the portfolio to better match available financing 
current conditions in both the financing and investment markets are continuously monitored in order to appropriately manage the cost of funds  investment spreads  asset liability duration matching and liquidity 
federal home loan bank of new york in june  prudential insurance became a member of the federal home loan bank of new york  or fhlbny 
membership allows prudential insurance to participate in fhlbny s product line of financial services  including collateralized funding agreements  general asset liability management  and collateralized advances that can be used for liquidity management 
our membership in fhlbny requires us to maintain ownership of member stock  and borrowings from fhlbny require us to purchase fhlbny activity based stock in an amount equal to of outstanding borrowings 
borrowings from the fhlbny are subject to prudential insurance having sufficient qualifying mortgage related assets or us treasury securities that can be pledged as collateral 
under guidance of the new jersey department of banking and insurance  the total amount of qualifying mortgage related assets and us treasury securities that can be pledged as collateral by prudential insurance to fhlbny is limited to of the prior year s statutory admitted assets of prudential insurance exclusive of separate account assets  which equates to billion based on admitted assets as of december  based upon this guidance and on the fair value of qualifying assets owned by prudential insurance within the financial services businesses as of december  including assets on loan and assets pledged to the fhlbny at that date and taking into account applicable required collateralization levels and required purchases of activity based fhlbny stock  the estimated total borrowing capacity with the fhlbny was approximately billion as of december  the fair value of the qualifying assets pledged as collateral by prudential insurance must be maintained at certain specified levels of the borrowed amount  which can vary  depending on the nature of the assets pledged 
if the fair value of the collateral declines below these levels  prudential insurance would be required to pledge additional collateral or repay outstanding borrowings 
if at the time of a proposed borrowing  or at a time when required to pledge additional collateral in respect of outstanding borrowings  prudential insurance had insufficient qualifying assets  it would need to obtain and pledge additional mortgage related assets and or treasury securities through asset purchases  reacquiring assets on loan or otherwise  subject to availability on appropriate terms 
as of december   we pledged qualifying assets with a fair value of billion  which is above the minimum level required by the fhlbny  and had outstanding borrowings of billion  of which billion is reflected in short term debt 
the remaining billion of the fhlbny borrowings outstanding as of december  are reflected in long term debt  and have maturities ranging from june  to december  at december   fhlbny proceeds of billion were invested in cash and short term investments at prudential insurance  while billion was used to support the operating needs of our businesses and for the purchase of the requisite fhlb activity based stock 
we expect to use approximately million of proceeds  currently invested in cash  to fund additional loans to affiliates 
the remaining billion in cash and short term instruments is expected to be used for repayment of billion of fhlbny maturities in april until such time as they are utilized for these purposes  proceeds may be available as another source of liquidity to prudential insurance 
we may  from time to time  borrow additional funds from fhlbny for purposes of managing liquidity  making operating loans to affiliates  asset liability management  or issuance of funding agreements 
in february  prudential insurance issued collateralized funding agreements in the amount of billion to the fhlbny 
the proceeds from this issuance were used to make spread investments 
these funding agreements will be reflected in policyholders account balances 
these funding agreements have priority claim status above debt holders of prudential insurance 
economic capital we are in the process of developing an economic capital framework  and have begun using economic capital as an additional source of information for our business decisions 
as we continue developing the framework  we will be assessing our overall capital position using both economic capital and our current framework  which is primarily based on statutory risk based capital measures 
liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries general liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations 
we manage the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations 
liquidity is provided by a variety of sources  as described more fully below  including portfolios of liquid assets 
the investment portfolios of our domestic operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations 
we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset liability management approach specific to the requirements of our product lines 
this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity  as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles  of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities 
we use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows  including claims 
liquidity is measured against internally developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support 
the results are affected substantially by the overall asset type and quality of our investments 
cash flow the principal sources of liquidity for prudential insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and annuity considerations  investment and fee income  and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations  as well as internal and external borrowings 
the principal uses of that liquidity include benefits  claims  dividends paid to policyholders  and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders  withdrawals and net policy loan activity 
other uses of liquidity include commissions  general and administrative expenses  purchases of investments  and payments in connection with financing activities 
we believe that the cash flows from our insurance and annuity operations are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations  including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions  changes in interest rate levels  policyholder perceptions of our financial strength  and the relative safety of competing products including those with enhancements under eesa  each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows 
in addition  market volatility can impact the level of capital required to support our businesses  particularly in our annuity business 
our domestic insurance operations cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal  proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income  net of amounts reinvested 
the primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers  our counterparties willingness to extend repurchase and or securities lending arrangements  commitments to invest and market volatility 
we closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position 
in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations  we also consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent  timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts and deposit liabilities 
the following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities based on statutory liability values as of the dates indicated 
december  december  amount of total amount of total in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions subject to discretionary withdrawal  with adjustment with market value adjustment at market value at contract value  less surrender charge of or more subtotal subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
our annuity reserves with guarantee features may be less susceptible to withdrawal than historical experience indicates  due to the current value of these guarantee features to policyholders as a result of recent market declines 
annuity benefits under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal 
gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations products amounted to approximately billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because these withdrawals were consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
liquid assets liquid assets include cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturities that are not designated as held to maturity and public equity securities 
as of december  and december   our domestic insurance operations had liquid assets of billion and billion  respectively  which includes a portion financed with asset based financing 
the portion of liquid assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was billion and billion as of december  and december   respectively 
as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our domestic insurance company general account portfolios were rated investment grade 
the remaining billion  or  of these fixed maturity investments were rated non investment grade 
we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures in order to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios 
we believe that the liquidity profile of our assets is sufficient to satisfy current liquidity requirements  including under foreseeable stress scenarios 
given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios  we believe that claim experience varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk 
our asset liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities 
historically  there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims 
our domestic insurance companies liquidity is managed through access to substantial investment portfolios as well as a variety of instruments available for funding and or managing short term cash flow mismatches  including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections 
to the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections  we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims  which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses affecting results of operations 
for a further discussion of realized investment gains or losses  see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses 
we believe that borrowing temporarily or selling investments earlier than anticipated will not have a material impact on the liquidity of our domestic insurance companies 
payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating and investing activities  respectively  in our financial statements 
prudential funding  llc prudential funding  llc  or prudential funding  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential insurance  serves as an additional source of financing to meet the working capital needs of prudential insurance and its subsidiaries 
prudential funding also lends to other subsidiaries of prudential financial up to limits established with the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
to the extent that other subsidiaries of prudential financial have financing needs in excess of these limits  these needs are met through financing from prudential financial directly or from third parties 
prudential funding operates under a support agreement with prudential insurance whereby prudential insurance has agreed to maintain prudential funding s positive tangible net worth at all times 
prudential funding borrows funds primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper 
prudential funding s outstanding commercial paper  including master note borrowings  were billion as of december  and billion as of december   and are more fully discussed in alternate sources of liquidity 
the impact of prudential funding s financing capacity on liquidity is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the domestic insurance operations 
the total principal amount of debt outstanding under prudential funding s domestic medium term note programs was million and million  as of december  and december   respectively  of which million was reflected in the general obligation short term debt as of december  the weighted average interest rates on prudential funding s long term debt  including the effect of interest rate hedging activity  were  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital the risk based capital  or rbc  ratio is the primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of prudential insurance and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries  which includes businesses in both the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
we manage prudential insurance s rbc ratio to a level consistent with a aa ratings objective 
rbc is determined by statutory formulas that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets  insurance related risks associated with an insurer s products  interest rate risks and general business risks 
the rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of an insurer s statutory capitalization 
as of december   rbc for prudential insurance was approximately  which exceeded the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations 
in addition  all of our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries have rbc ratios that exceed the minimum levels required by applicable insurance regulations 
the inclusion of rbc measures is intended solely for the information of investors and is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing  advertising or promotional activities 
as discussed above  market conditions during negatively impacted the level of capital in our domestic life insurance subsidiaries 
in order to address these impacts on our capital  we undertook various initiatives to redeploy certain assets to our insurance subsidiaries from our non insurance subsidiaries of the company 
the most material of these initiatives was the contribution of prudential securities group to prudential insurance  as discussed below 
we also made capital contributions to certain domestic insurance subsidiaries  which the subsidiaries subsequently used to repay portions of their outstanding loans with prudential financial 
contribution of prudential securities group to prudential insurance as a result of the negative impact of market dislocations on capital levels within prudential insurance  we contributed prudential securities group to prudential insurance to strengthen capital during the fourth quarter of this contribution increased prudential insurance s net admitted assets by billion 
prudential securities group owns our investment in the wachovia securities joint venture  which we account for under the equity method  as well as other wholly owned businesses  principally our global commodities group 
as of december  and december   prudential securities group s assets totaled billion and billion  respectively 
on december   we announced our intention  assuming completion of the merger of wachovia into wells fargo  to exercise our right under the lookback option to put our joint venture interests in wachovia securities to wells fargo 
as reported by wells fargo  the merger was completed on december  under the terms of the joint venture agreements  closing of the put transaction would occur on or about january  the full value we expect to receive related to the lookback option is not yet reflected in the capital levels of prudential insurance as the investment is carried at book value 
we expect to realize the full value no later than the first quarter of we are continuing to evaluate alternatives to realize the full value of the investment prior to january see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our investment in wachovia securities 
distributions from our investment in wachovia securities to prudential securities group totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the other wholly owned businesses in prudential securities group  principally our global commodities group  continue to maintain sufficiently liquid balance sheets  consisting mostly of cash and cash equivalents  segregated client assets  and short term receivables from clients  broker dealers  and exchanges 
as registered broker dealers and members of various self regulatory organizations  our us registered broker dealer subsidiaries and wachovia securities are subject to the sec s uniform net capital rule  as well as the net capital requirements of the commodity futures trading commission and the various securities and commodities exchanges of which they are members 
compliance with these capital requirements could limit the ability of these operations to pay dividends 
international insurance subsidiaries in our international insurance operations  liquidity is provided through ongoing operations as well as portfolios of liquid assets 
in managing the liquidity and the interest and credit risk profiles of our international insurance portfolios  we employ a discipline similar to the discipline employed for domestic insurance subsidiaries 
we monitor liquidity through the use of internal liquidity measures  taking into account the liquidity of the asset portfolios 
as with our domestic operations  in managing the liquidity of these operations  we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
as of december  and december   our international insurance subsidiaries had total general account insurance related liabilities other than dividends payable to policyholders of billion and billion  respectively 
of those amounts  billion and billion  respectively  were associated with gibraltar life 
concurrent with our acquisition of gibraltar life in april  substantially all of its insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies 
these charges  initially  declining to their current level  and reducing to in april  were designed to mitigate the extent  timing  and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers 
the charges apply to billion and billion of gibraltar life s insurance related reserves as of december  and december   respectively 
we do not expect any material increases in the level of surrenders due to the expiration of these surrender charges 
policies issued by gibraltar life post acquisition are not subject to the above restructured policy surrender charge schedule 
policies issued post acquisition are generally subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value  less applicable surrender charges  which currently start at or more 
a special dividend to certain gibraltar life policyholders was payable in and the final dividend will be payable in the special dividend is based on of the net increase in the fair value  through march  of certain real estate and loans  net of transaction costs and taxes  included in the gibraltar life reorganization plan 
as of december   a liability of million related to the special dividend is included in policyholders dividends 
the special dividend will take the form of additional policy values  and to a lesser extent  cash 
gibraltar life s investment portfolio is structured to provide adequate liquidity for the special dividend 
prudential of japan had billion and billion of general account insurance related liabilities  other than dividends to policyholders  as of december  and december   respectively 
prudential of japan did not have a material amount of general account annuity reserves or deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of december  or december  additionally  we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by prudential of japan do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
as of december  and december   our international insurance subsidiaries had cash and short term investments of approximately billion and billion  respectively  and fixed maturity investments  other than those designated as held to maturity  with fair values of billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our international insurance subsidiaries were rated investment grade 
the remaining billion  or  of these fixed maturity investments were rated non investment grade 
of those amounts  billion of the investment grade fixed maturity investments and billion of the non investment grade fixed maturity investments were associated with gibraltar life 
we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate the adequacy of our international insurance operations liquidity under stress scenarios 
we believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our international insurance assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
similar to the rbc ratios that are employed by us insurance regulators  regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies 
all of our international insurance subsidiaries have solvency margins in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities 
these solvency margins are also the primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of our international insurance operations 
we manage these solvency margins to a level consistent with our aa ratings objective 
during the fourth quarter of  market conditions negatively impacted the level of capital in our international life insurance subsidiaries  particularly in japan 
while our international insurance operations in japan have been able to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives  we will make capital contributions of approximately million to our japan life insurance subsidiaries during the first quarter of maintenance of our solvency ratios at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning  as in certain jurisdictions  such as japan  these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer s financial strength 
we employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements as discussed in results of operations for financial services businesses by segment international insurance and investments division 
cash settlements from this hedging activity result in cash flows to or from prudential financial and are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged 
the cash settlements include those for internal hedges related to the us dollar denominated investments held on the books of the yen based entities as well as for external hedges 
a significant yen appreciation over an extended period would result in net cash outflows from prudential financial in excess of our historical experience 
asset management subsidiaries our asset management businesses  which include real estate  public and private fixed income and public equity asset management  as well as commercial mortgage origination and servicing  and retail investment products  such as mutual funds and other retail services  are largely unregulated from the standpoint of dividends and distributions 
our asset management subsidiaries through which we conduct these businesses generally do not have restrictions on the amount of distributions they can make  and provide a relatively stable source of significant cash flow to prudential financial 
the principal sources of liquidity for our fee based asset management businesses include asset management fees  and commercial mortgage servicing fees 
the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses  and distribution of dividends and returns of capital to prudential financial 
the primary liquidity risks for our fee based asset management businesses relate to their profitability  which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance 
we believe the cash flows from our fee based asset management businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of their operations  as well as requirements that could arise under foreseeable stress scenarios  which are monitored through the use of internal measures 
the principal sources of liquidity for our proprietary investments and interim loans are cash flows from investments  the ability to liquidate investments  and available borrowing lines from internal sources  including prudential funding and prudential financial  and external sources 
the primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner  declines in the value of assets and credit defaults 
the current adverse market conditions have increased the liquidity risks associated with our proprietary investments and interim loans 
the markets for certain investments  such as commercial mortgages and real estate  have become less liquid 
if we needed to sell these investments  we may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner at a price that we could otherwise realize 
in the fourth quarter of  two entities within the asset management segment made a request to redeem their entire investment from a proprietary fixed income fund  which aggregate investments were million as of december  the fixed income fund has suspended redemptions 
due to market conditions  the amount and timing of the payment of redemption proceeds cannot be predicted at this time 
in december  we received approval from the new jersey department of banking and insurance for prudential insurance to extend an month billion lending facility to our commercial mortgage operation that is collateralized primarily by its interim loan portfolio 
in december  the facility was executed and the proceeds were used to repay financing provided by prudential financial 
as of december   approximately billion was outstanding 
during the fourth quarter of  in our proprietary investing business  we received repayments of real estate loans secured by equity commitments from investors and assets of funds managed by us  and we reduced exposure to certain public equity and real estate seed investments 
the proceeds of these activities  which totaled billion  were used to repay financing provided by prudential financial and prudential funding 
certain real estate funds under management are held for the benefit of clients in insurance company separate accounts sponsored by prudential insurance 
in the normal course of business  these separate accounts enter into purchase commitments which include commitments to purchase real estate  invest in future real estate partnerships  and or fund additional construction or other expenditures on previously acquired real estate investments 
certain purchases of real estate are contingent on the developer s development of the real estate according to plans and specifications outlined in a pre sale agreement or the property achieving a certain level of leasing 
purchase commitments are typically entered into by prudential insurance on behalf of the particular separate account and  upon acquisition  are titled either in prudential insurance or an llc subsidiary formed for that purpose 
in certain cases  the commitments specify that recourse on the obligation is limited to the assets of the separate account 
as of december   these separate account portfolios had billion of outstanding purchase commitments  of which billion are anticipated to become due in and others may become due upon a failure to maintain required loan to value ratios or to satisfy other financial covenants 
of the billion of total commitments  billion are full recourse to pica  of which billion are anticipated to become due in of the billion of total commitments  billion represents commitments that are not reflected on our balance sheet as of december  these separate accounts have also entered into syndicated credit facilities providing for borrowings in the aggregate amount of billion  of which billion was outstanding at february  these facilities also include loan to value ratio requirements and other financial covenants 
recourse on obligations under these facilities is limited to the assets of the applicable separate account 
as of december   the separate account portfolios had a combined net asset value of billion 
at the time of maturity of a commitment obligation  prudential insurance often endeavors to negotiate extensions  refinancings or other solutions with creditors 
management believes that the separate accounts have sufficient resources to ultimately meet their obligations 
however  because of the volatility and disruption in the credit and capital markets  the separate accounts may not be able to timely fund all maturing obligations from regular sources such as asset sales  operating cash flow  deposits from clients and debt refinancings or from the above mentioned portfolio level credit facilities 
in cases where the separate account is not able to fund maturing obligations  prudential insurance may be called upon or required to provide interim funding solutions 
as of december  and december   our asset management subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of billion and billion  respectively  which include million and million of short term loans to real estate funds  respectively 
in reporting results for the three months ended march   we had classified our commercial mortgage securitization operations as a divested business for all periods reported  reflecting our decision to exit this business 
we retained and continue the remainder of our commercial mortgage origination  servicing and other commercial mortgage related activities  which remain a part of our asset management segment 
we do not expect this decision to have a material impact on the liquidity of our asset management subsidiaries 
for further details  see divested businesses 
financing activities as of december  and december   total short and long term debt of the company on a consolidated basis was billion and billion  respectively  which includes billion and billion  respectively  related to the parent company  prudential financial 
prudential financial borrowings prudential financial is authorized to borrow funds from various sources to meet its capital and other funding needs  as well as the capital and other funding needs of its subsidiaries 
the following table sets forth the outstanding short and long term debt of prudential financial  other than debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries  as of the dates indicated december  december  in millions borrowings general obligation short term debt commercial paper floating rate convertible senior notes foreign denominated bridge loan facility current portion of long term debt general obligation long term debt senior debt junior subordinated debt hybrid securities retail medium term notes total general obligations the following table presents  as of december   prudential financial s contractual maturities of its general obligation long term debt calendar year senior debt junior subordinated debt retail medium term notes in millions and thereafter total in march  prudential financial filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  which permits the issuance of public debt  equity and hybrid securities 
as a well known seasoned issuer under sec rules  prudential financial s shelf registration statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing  pay as you go fees and the ability to add securities by filing automatically effective amendments 
also  in accordance with these rules  the shelf registration statement has no stated issuance capacity 
in march  prudential financial filed a prospectus supplement for its medium term notes  series d program under the shelf registration statement  which superseded its medium term notes  series c program 
in january  the authorized issuance capacity of the series d program was increased by billion to billion  and as of december   approximately billion remained available under the program 
in january  prudential financial issued million of year medium term notes under this program 
the net proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to fund operating needs of our subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes 
the weighted average interest rates on prudential financial s medium term and senior notes  including the effect of interest rate hedging activity  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively  excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries 
given the disruptions in the credit markets  we have been unable to issue debt at an affordable cost recently and it is uncertain at this time whether we can currently issue debt under our mtn program at all  or at a cost that would not be prohibitive 
in march  prudential financial filed a prospectus supplement under the shelf registration statement for its retail medium term notes  including the internotes program  which superseded the retail medium term notes program 
in march  the authorized issuance capacity of the retail medium term notes program was increased by billion to billion  and as of december   approximately billion remained available under the program 
this retail medium term notes program has served as a funding source for a spread product of our retirement segment that is economically similar to funding agreement backed medium term notes issued to institutional investors  except that the retail notes are senior unsecured obligations of prudential financial and are primarily purchased by retail investors 
however  proceeds from the retail medium term note program can also be used for general corporate purposes 
the weighted average interest rates on prudential financial s retail medium term notes were and for the years ended december  and  respectively  excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries 
our retail medium term notes program has also been negatively impacted by the disruptions in the credit markets 
the decline in demand for risk bearing investments among retail investors  and the related increase in funding costs  has resulted in a halt in new debt issuances under this program 
as the market dislocations abate and investor demand improves  we may resume issuances under the program 
in may  prudential financial borrowed billion under unsecured bridge loan facilities provided by two institutions 
these facilities matured on february  and were repaid using internal sources of cash 
the carrying value of these loans was million as of december  the net proceeds had been used to repay maturing debt that was issued concurrently with our acquisition of gibraltar life in april  which served to fund capital requirements of gibraltar life 
in june  prudential financial issued million of fixed to floating rate junior subordinated notes to institutional investors 
also in june  prudential financial issued million of junior subordinated notes to retail investors with a fixed interest rate of paid quarterly 
in july  prudential financial issued an additional million of retail junior subordinated notes following the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
both issuances are considered hybrid capital securities  which receive enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies 
both series of notes have a scheduled maturity of june  and a final maturity of june  prudential financial is required to use commercially reasonable efforts  subject to market disruption events  to raise sufficient proceeds from the issuance of specified qualifying capital securities  which include hybrid capital securities  to repay the principal of the notes at their scheduled maturity 
for the institutional notes  interest is payable semi annually at a fixed rate of until june   from which date interest is payable quarterly at a floating rate of month libor plus 
prudential financial may redeem the institutional notes  subject to the terms of the replacement capital covenant  or rcc  as discussed below  in whole or in part  on or after june  at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  or prior to june  at a make whole price 
prudential financial may redeem the retail notes subject to the terms of the rcc as discussed below  on or after june   in whole or in part  at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  or prior to june   in whole  at a make whole price 
both series of notes may also be redeemed in whole upon the occurrence of certain defined events 
prudential financial has the right to defer interest payments on either or both series of notes for a period up to ten years  during which time interest will be compounded 
if prudential financial were to exercise its right to defer interest it will be required  commencing on the earlier of i the first interest payment date on which current interest is paid after the deferral period or ii the fifth anniversary of the deferral period  to issue specified alternative payment securities  which include but are not limited to common stock  to satisfy its obligation with respect to the deferred interest 
in connection with the issuance of both series of notes  prudential financial entered into a rcc for the benefit of holders of its senior notes due under the rcc  prudential financial agreed that it will not repay  redeem  defease  or purchase the notes prior to june   unless it has received proceeds from the issuance of specified replacement capital securities  which include but are not limited to hybrid capital securities as well as common stock 
the rcc will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events  including acceleration due to an event of default 
prudential financial used the proceeds from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of its common stock under the share repurchase authorization 
in january  prudential financial filed a prospectus supplement to register under the shelf registration statement resales of the floating rate convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in december billion 
these notes are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of prudential financial s common stock 
the conversion price  per share  is subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events 
the conversion feature requires net settlement in shares  therefore  upon conversion  a holder would receive cash up to the par amount of the convertible notes surrendered for conversion and shares of prudential financial common stock only for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount  if any 
the interest rate on these notes is a floating rate equal to month libor minus  with a minimum interest rate of  to be reset quarterly 
these notes have been redeemable by prudential financial  at par plus accrued interest  since december  holders of the notes may also require prudential financial to repurchase the notes  at par plus accrued interest  on contractually specified dates 
at the request of the holders  on december  and  billion and million  respectively  of senior notes were repurchased by prudential financial

in april  july and october  prudential financial filed prospectus supplements to register under the shelf registration statement resales of the floating rate convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in december billion 
these notes are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of prudential financial s common stock 
the conversion price  per share  is subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events 
the conversion feature requires net settlement in shares  therefore  upon conversion  a holder would receive cash up to the par amount of the convertible notes surrendered for conversion and shares of prudential financial common stock only for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount  if any 
the interest rate on these notes is a floating rate equal to month libor minus  with a minimum interest rate of  to be reset quarterly 
these notes are redeemable by prudential financial  at par plus accrued interest  on or after june  holders of the notes may also require prudential financial to repurchase the notes  at par plus accrued interest  on contractually specified dates  of which the first such date is june  prior to such date  we may  from time to time  depending on economic considerations choose to repurchase portions of the outstanding notes from certain qualified institutional buyers 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased  in individually negotiated transactions  million of these notes which were offered to the company by certain holders 
these notes were repurchased at a discount resulting in a pre tax gain of million that is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
as of december   billion of these notes remain outstanding 
at december   billion of the proceeds were held in cash and short term investments 
the remainder was used to fund operating loans to affiliates 
in the event the investors elect to put the notes to us on june   we intend to defease our obligation through a combination of existing cash and short term investments and repayment of loans by our affiliates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning these convertible senior notes 
we are required beginning on january  to retrospectively adopt the requirements of financial statement position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this guidance will impact the accounting for our convertible debt instruments as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in march  prudential financial updated its european medium term notes program 
the company is authorized to issue up to billion of notes under the program 
as of december   there was no debt outstanding under this program 
consolidated borrowings current capital markets activities for the company on a consolidated basis principally consist of unsecured short term and long term debt borrowings issued by prudential funding and prudential financial  unsecured third party bank borrowings  and asset based or secured financing 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to the borrowings in the table below 
the following table sets forth total consolidated borrowings of the company as of the dates indicated december  december  in millions borrowings general obligation short term debt general obligation long term debt senior debt junior subordinated debt hybrid securities surplus notes other total general obligation long term debt total general obligations limited and non recourse borrowing limited and non recourse short term debt limited and non recourse long term debt total limited and non recourse borrowing total borrowings total asset based financing total borrowings and asset based financings as of december   billion and billion of short term and long term debt  respectively  were collateralized borrowings with the federal home loan bank of new york 
as of december  and december   includes billion and billion  respectively  of floating rate surplus notes issued by subsidiaries of prudential insurance to fund regulatory reserves  as well as million of fixed rate surplus notes issued by prudential insurance 
as of both december  and  billion of limited and non recourse long term debt outstanding was attributable to the closed block business 
does not include billion and billion of medium term notes of consolidated trust entities secured by funding agreements purchased with the proceeds of such notes as of december  and december   respectively 
these notes are included in policyholders account balances 
for additional information see funding agreement notes issuance program 
total general debt obligations increased by million from december  to december   reflecting a billion net increase in long term debt and a billion net decrease in short term debt 
the net increase in long term debt was primarily driven by the issuance of junior subordinated debt in the second quarter of  as well as the net issuance of medium term notes  retail medium term notes  and surplus notes  partially offset by the reclassification of long term debt to short term debt 
the net decrease in short term debt was primarily due to a decrease in outstanding commercial paper supporting our operating businesses at prudential funding and prudential financial  the maturity of medium term notes and the repurchase of floating rate convertible senior notes 
the naic has adopted a model regulation entitled valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as regulation xxx  and a supporting guideline entitled the application of the valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as guideline axxx 
the regulation and supporting guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees 
many market participants believe that this level of reserves is excessive  and we have implemented reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the impact of regulation xxx and guideline axxx on our term and universal life insurance businesses  including those actions which are described in more detail below 
during  a subsidiary of prudential insurance entered into a surplus note purchase agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution that provides for the issuance of up to billion of ten year floating rate surplus notes commonly referred to as xxx notes for the purpose of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain term life insurance policies 
concurrent with the issuance of each surplus note  prudential financial enters into arrangements with the buyer  which are accounted for as derivative instruments  that may result in payments by  or to  prudential financial over the term of the surplus notes  to the extent there are significant changes in the value of the surplus notes 
principal factors that impact the value of the surplus notes are mortality experience and interest rates 
as of december   there have been no payments made under the derivative instrument 
surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments 
during the year ended december   the subsidiary issued an additional billion of surplus notes  resulting in total outstanding notes under this facility of billion and billion as of december  and december   respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during  a subsidiary of prudential insurance issued million of year floating rate surplus notes commonly referred to as axxx notes to an unaffiliated financial institution for the purpose of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain universal life insurance policies 
surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
concurrent with the issuance of these surplus notes  prudential financial entered into a credit derivative that will require prudential financial to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of the surplus note 
under this credit derivative  we are required to post cash collateral based on tests that consider the level of year credit default swap spreads on prudential financial s senior debt 
as of december   when estimates of prudential financial s year credit default swap spreads were basis points  we posted million of collateral under this agreement 
we estimate that the collateral posting requirements could be million at an effective year credit default swap spread of  basis points  based on indications of forward libor rates as of december  as we continue to underwrite term and universal life business  we expect to have borrowing needs in to finance statutory reserves required under regulation xxx and guideline axxx 
however  based on current market conditions  we may not be able to finance these needs 
we are currently reviewing both internal and external sources of funding to address these needs 
our total borrowings consist of capital debt  investment related debt  securities business related debt and debt related to specified other businesses 
capital debt is borrowing that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of prudential financial as well as borrowings invested in equity or debt securities of direct or indirect subsidiaries of prudential financial and subsidiary borrowings utilized for capital requirements 
investment related borrowings consist of debt issued to finance specific investment assets or portfolios of investment assets  including institutional spread lending investment portfolios  real estate and real estate related investments held in consolidated joint ventures  as well as institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences 
securities business related debt consists of debt issued to finance primarily the liquidity of our broker dealers and our capital markets and other securities business related operations 
debt related to specified other businesses consists of borrowings associated with our individual annuity business  real estate franchises and relocation services 
borrowings under which either the holder is entitled to collect only against the assets pledged to the debt as collateral  or has only very limited rights to collect against other assets  have been classified as limited and non recourse debt 
consolidated borrowings as of december  and december  included billion of limited and non recourse debt attributable to the closed block business 
the following table summarizes our borrowings  categorized by use of proceeds  as of the dates indicated december  december  in millions general obligations capital debt investment related securities business related specified other businesses total general obligations limited and non recourse debt total borrowings short term debt long term debt total borrowings borrowings of financial services businesses borrowings of closed block business total borrowings funding agreement notes issuance program in  prudential insurance established a funding agreement notes issuance program pursuant to which a delaware statutory trust issues medium term notes which are included in our statements of financial position in policyholders account balances and not included in the foregoing table secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by prudential insurance and included in our retirement segment 
the funding agreements provide cash flow sufficient for the debt service on the related medium term notes 
the medium term notes are sold in transactions not requiring registration under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes have fixed or floating interest rates and original maturities ranging from two to seven years 
as of december  and december   the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes totaled approximately billion and billion  respectively  out of a total authorized amount of up to billion 
the decrease in outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes is reflective of maturities outpacing new issuances during sales of these notes have been negatively impacted by unfavorable capital markets conditions  in particular during the second half of as the stress experienced by global financial markets that began in the second half of continued and substantially increased 
the aggregate maturities of these notes over the next months are approximately billion 
we intend to repay the maturing notes through a combination of cash flows from new liability origination  asset maturities  asset sales and internal sources of funds such as prudential funding 
lines of credit and other credit facilities as of december   prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling billion 
these facilities are available to each of the borrowers  up to the aggregate committed credit  to be used for general corporate purposes 
this amount includes a billion year credit facility that expires in may  which includes financial institutions  and a billion credit facility  of which million expires in december and billion expires in december  which includes financial institutions 
we maintain these facilities primarily as back up liquidity lines for our commercial paper programs  and there were no outstanding borrowings under either facility as of december  any borrowings made under these outstanding facilities would mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the facilities and would bear interest at the rates set forth in each facility agreement 
within each facility  no single financial institution has more than of the total committed credit 
in january of  a consent was executed removing lehman commercial paper inc and lehman brothers bank fsb  as participants in the facilities 
lehman commercial paper inc  which filed for bankruptcy in october  had been a participant in the billion facility in the amount of million 
lehman brothers bank fsb had been a participant in the billion facility in the amount of million 
the result of this action was a reduction in the overall facility total to billion 
our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the continued satisfaction of customary conditions  including the maintenance at all times by prudential insurance of total adjusted capital of at least billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under new jersey law and prudential financial s maintenance of consolidated net worth of at least billion  which for this purpose is based on gaap stockholders equity  excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments 
our ability to borrow under these facilities is not contingent on our credit ratings or subject to material adverse change clauses 
prudential insurance s total adjusted capital was billion and billion as of december  and december   respectively 
prudential financial s consolidated gaap stockholders equity  excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments  was billion and billion as of december  and december   respectively 
we also use uncommitted lines of credit from financial institutions 
contractual obligation the table below summarizes the future estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of december  the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary  possibly materially  from those reflected in the table 
in addition  we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations  as the table below does not contemplate all aspects of our cash inflows  such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments  nor all aspects of our cash outflows 
estimated payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions short term and long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations commitments to purchase or fund investments commercial mortgage loan commitments other liabilities insurance liabilities other total the estimated payments due by period for long term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as estimated future interest payments 
the payment of principal and estimated future interest for short term debt are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year 
the estimate for future interest payments includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our short term and long term debt 
the estimated payments due by period for operating leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no significant capital lease obligations 
we have commitments to purchase or fund investments  some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control  including those at the discretion of our counterparties 
the timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated  therefore the settlement of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year 
commitments to purchase or fund investments include billion that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts 
of these separate account commitments  billion have recourse to prudential insurance if the separate accounts are unable to fund the amounts when due 
for further discussion of these separate account commitments  see liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries asset management subsidiaries 
loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations  which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty  have been reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment  however  it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration 
in certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee 
the estimated payments due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits  policyholders account balances  policyholder s dividends  reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities 
these future estimated cash outflows are based on mortality  morbidity  lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience  consider future premium receipts on current policies in force  and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired 
these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and  as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated financial statements as of december  separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations  and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash flows 
we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  actual cash outflows will differ  possibly materially  from these estimates 
the estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase  cash collateral for loaned securities  liabilities recorded under fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 and other miscellaneous liabilities 
we also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business  however  these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of december  off balance sheet arrangements guarantees and other contingencies in the course of our business  we provide certain guarantees and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make payments now or in the future 
a number of guarantees provided by us relate to real estate investments held in our separate accounts  in which the separate account has borrowed funds  and we have guaranteed their obligation to their lender 
we provide these guarantees to assist the separate account in obtaining financing for the transaction 
our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was billion as of december  any payments that may become required of us under these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the underlying collateral  or would provide us with rights to obtain the underlying collateral 
recourse for billion of the maximum potential exposure is limited to the assets of the separate account 
the remaining exposure primarily relates to guarantees limited to fraud  criminal activity or other bad acts 
these guarantees generally expire at various times over the next ten years 
at december   no amounts were accrued as a result our assessment that it is unlikely payments will be required 
we have also provided a guarantee to a syndication of lenders in connection with a retail development project in singapore that is co owned by us and an unconsolidated real estate fund we manage 
the principal provisions in the guarantee requires that the loan to value ratio of the retail development project be maintained at or lower  based on an external appraisal 
a loan to value ratio in excess of would require us and our co owner to jointly and severally paydown the loan balance to the level 
the current loan to value ratio  based on a december appraisal  is 
other obligations under the guarantee include guaranteeing the interest servicing on the loan on a proportionate basis and undertaking to fund development cost overruns 
our exposure under the guarantee was million as of december   which assumes the co owner honors their joint guarantee 
we write credit derivatives under which we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the defaulted security or similar security 
our maximum amount at risk under these credit derivatives  assuming the value of the underlying referenced securities become worthless  is billion at december  these credit derivatives generally have maturities of five years or less 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning credit derivatives 
certain contracts underwritten by the retirement segment include guarantees related to financial assets owned by the guaranteed party 
these contracts are accounted for as derivatives  at fair value  in accordance with sfas no 
as of december   such contracts in force carried a total guaranteed value of billion 
these guarantees are supported by collateral that is not reflected on our balance sheet 
this collateral had a fair value of billion as of december  we arrange for credit enhancements of certain debt instruments that provide financing for commercial real estate assets  including certain tax exempt bond financings 
the credit enhancements provide assurances to the debt holders as to the timely payment of amounts due under the debt instruments 
as of december   such enhancement arrangements total million  with remaining contractual maturities of up to years 
our obligation to reimburse required payments is secured by mortgages on the related real estate  which properties are valued at million as of december  we receive certain ongoing fees for providing these enhancement arrangements and anticipate the extinguishment of our obligation under these enhancements prior to maturity through the aggregation and transfer of our positions to a substitute enhancement provider 
as of december   we have accrued liabilities of million representing unearned fees on these arrangements 
as part of the commercial mortgage activities of our asset management segment  we provide commercial mortgage origination  underwriting and servicing for certain government sponsored entities  such as fannie mae and freddie mac 
we have agreed to indemnify the government sponsored entities for a portion of the credit risk associated with certain of the mortgages we service through a delegated authority arrangement 
under these arrangements  we originate multi family mortgages for sale to the government sponsored entities based on underwriting standards they specify  and make payments to them for a specified percentage share of losses they incur on certain loans we service 
our percentage share of losses incurred generally varies from to of the loan balance  and is typically based on a first loss exposure for a stated percentage of the loan balance  plus a shared exposure with the government sponsored entity for any losses in excess of the stated first loss percentage  subject to a contractually specified maximum percentage 
we service billion of mortgages subject to these loss sharing arrangements as of december   all of which are collateralized by first priority liens on the underlying multi family residential properties 
as of december   these mortgages had an average debt service coverage ratio of times and an average loan to value ratio of 
the maximum exposure to loss as of december   assuming no recovery on any of the underlying collateral  is million  with first loss exposure of million 
over the three years ended december   our total share of losses related to indemnifications that were settled was million 
as of december   we have established a liability of million related to these indemnifications 
in connection with certain acquisitions  we agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods  based upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives 
in accordance with us gaap  we do not accrue contingent consideration obligations prior to the attainment of the objectives 
as of december   maximum potential future consideration pursuant to such arrangements  to be resolved over the following five years  is million 
any such payments would result in increases in intangible assets  including goodwill 
we are also subject to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements 
we have provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions  dispositions  investments and other transactions that are triggered by  among other things  breaches of representations  warranties or covenants provided by us 
these obligations are typically subject to various time limitations  defined by the contract or by operation of law  such as statutes of limitation 
in some cases  the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations  while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable 
since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations  it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees 
as of december   we have accrued liabilities of million associated with all other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements  which does not include retained liabilities associated with sold businesses 
other contingent commitments in connection with our commercial mortgage operations  we originate commercial mortgage loans 
as of december   we had outstanding commercial mortgage loan commitments with borrowers of billion 
in certain of these transactions  we prearrange that we will sell the loan to an investor after we fund the loan 
as of december   million of our commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans are subject to such arrangements 
we also have other commitments  some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control  including those at the discretion of our counterparties 
these other commitments amounted to billion as of december  reflected in these other commitments are billion of commitments to purchase or fund investments  including billion that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts 
of these separate account commitments  billion have recourse to prudential insurance if the separate accounts are unable to fund the amounts when due

in addition  we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to associated assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk  the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities 
we consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses 
market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  equity prices or commodity prices 
to varying degrees  the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate exposure to market risk 
the market risk incurred and our strategies for managing this risk varies by product 
with respect to non variable life insurance products  fixed rate annuities  the fixed rate options in our variable life insurance and annuity products  and other finance businesses  we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
we manage this risk through asset liability management strategies that seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity  but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics  of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements within the context of market conditions and other relative opportunities 
while it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets  to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products 
for variable annuities and variable life insurance products  excluding the fixed rate options in these products  mutual funds and most separate accounts  our main exposure to the market is the risk that asset based fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in investment prices 
we also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower 
the risk of decreased asset based and asset management fees could also impact our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
while a decrease in our estimates of total gross profits would accelerate amortization and decrease net income in a given period  it would not affect our cash flow or liquidity position 
for variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death benefits and variable annuity products with living benefits such as guaranteed minimum income  withdrawal  and accumulation benefits  we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a result of interest rate  equity market  or market volatility changes may increase our net exposure to the guarantees under these contracts 
as part of our risk management strategy  we utilize product design elements such as asset allocation requirements  an automatic rebalancing element and minimum purchase age requirements  in addition to externally purchased hedging instruments such as interest rate and equity based derivatives to hedge or limit our market risk exposure to the benefit features of certain of our variable annuity contracts 
these strategies exclude our guaranteed minimum income benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits  which include risks we have deemed suitable to retain 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our use of interest rate and equity based derivatives 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the guaranteed minimum death benefits associated with our variable life and variable annuity contracts  and the guaranteed minimum income  withdrawal  and accumulation benefits associated with the variable annuity contracts we issue 
for a discussion of asset based fees associated with our variable life products and our variable annuity contracts  our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and the impact of our guaranteed minimum death and other benefits on the results of our individual life and individual annuities segments  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us individual life and group insurance division individual life and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
in addition  certain products supported by general account investments expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts 
market fluctuations or changes in market conditions could also cause a change in consumer sentiment adversely affecting sales and persistency of our long term savings  protection and other investment products 
for additional information regarding the potential impacts of interest rate and other market fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions on our businesses and profitability see item a 
risk factors 
the sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into two categories  other than trading activities conducted primarily in our insurance and annuity operations  and trading activities conducted primarily in our derivatives trading operations 
as part of our management of both other than trading and trading market risks  we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques 
these include sensitivity and value at risk  or var  measures  position and other limits based on type of risk  and various hedging methods 
other than trading activities we hold the majority of our assets for other than trading activities in our segments that offer insurance  retirement and annuities products 
we incorporate asset liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets 
we use derivatives for hedging and other purposes in the asset liability management process 
insurance and annuities products asset liability management we seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures within established ranges  which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers 
our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer  geographic region  type of security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage interest rate and equity exposure risk  as well as credit  liquidity and other risks  all within policy constraints set by management and approved by the investment committee of the board of directors 
for additional information regarding the management of our general account investments and our asset mix strategies  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments management of investments 
we use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes 
duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates 
convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates 
we seek to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes  or controlling duration mismatch of assets and liabilities 
we have target duration mismatch constraints by segment for each insurance entity 
in certain markets  primarily outside the us  capital market limitations that hinder our ability to closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities are considered in setting the constraint limits 
as of december  and  the difference between the pre tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our constraint limits 
we consider risk based capital and tax implications as well as current market conditions in our asset liability management strategies 
we also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our us regulatory cash flow and stress scenario testing for major product lines that are subject to risk from changes in interest rates 
in this testing  we evaluate the impact of altering our interest sensitive assumptions under various adverse interest rate environments 
these interest sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and prepayments of fixed income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products and the potential impact of any guaranteed minimum interest rates 
we evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies 
market risk related to interest rates our other than trading assets that subject us to interest rate risk include primarily fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans and policy loans 
in the aggregate  the carrying value of these assets represented of our consolidated assets  other than assets that we held in separate accounts  as of december  and as of december  with respect to other than trading liabilities  we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to interest sensitive life insurance  annuity and other investment type contracts  collectively referred to as investment contracts  and through outstanding short term and long term debt 
we assess interest rate sensitivity for other than trading financial assets  financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates  reflecting changes in either credit spreads or the risk free rate 
the following tables set forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical basis point upward shift as of december  and  because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates 
while the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets  it is a near term  reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events 
these test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non parallel shifts in the yield curve  which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities 
as a result  the actual loss in fair value from a basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidated variable interest entities 
the tables above do not include approximately billion of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities as of december  and billion as of december  which are not considered financial liabilities 
we believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities would serve as an offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial assets and liabilities  including investment contracts  which are set forth in these tables 
our net estimated potential loss in fair value as of december  increased million from december  the estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities  but do not include separate account assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholders rather than by us 
market risk related to equity prices we actively manage investment equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets 
we benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices  mainly the s p and russell for us equities 
for foreign equities we benchmark against the tokyo price index  or topix  and the msci eafe  a market index of european  australian  and far eastern equities 
we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices 
we estimate our investment equity price risk from a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold 
using this methodology  our estimated investment equity price risk as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
our estimated investment equity price risk using this methodology as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
in calculating these amounts  we exclude separate account equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholder rather than by us 
in addition to equity securities  as indicated above  we hold equity based derivatives primarily to hedge the equity price risk embedded in the living benefit features in some of our variable annuity products 
as of december   our equity based derivatives had notional values of billion  and were reported at fair value as a billion asset  and the living benefit features accounted for as derivatives were reported at fair value as a billion liability 
as of december   our equity based derivatives had notional values of billion  and were reported at fair value as a million asset  and the living benefits features accounted for as derivatives were reported at fair value as a million liability 
our estimated equity price risk associated with the equity based derivatives  net of the related living benefit features  was less than million as of both december  and  estimated based on a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels 
while these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio  they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events 
these scenarios consider only the direct impact on fair value of declines in equity benchmark market levels and not changes in asset based fees recognized as revenue  changes in our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs  or changes in any other assumptions such as market volatility or mortality  utilization or persistency rates in our variable annuity contracts that could also impact the fair value of our living benefit features 
in addition  these scenarios do not reflect the impact of basis risk  such as potential differences in the performance of the investment funds underlying the variable annuity products relative to the market indices we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy 
the impact of basis risk could result in larger differences between the change in fair value of the equity based derivatives and the related living benefit features  in comparison to the scenarios above 
market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our domestic general account investment portfolios  other proprietary investment portfolios and through our operations in foreign countries and foreign currency liability issuances 
our exposure to foreign currency risk within the domestic general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations and other domestic proprietary investment portfolios arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we generally hedge substantially all domestic general account foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and other domestic proprietary foreign currency investments into us dollars in order to mitigate the risk that the cash flows or fair value of these investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities 
our operations in foreign countries create the following three additional sources of foreign currency risk first  we reflect the operating results of our foreign operations in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
we hedge some of these foreign currency operating results as part of our overall risk management strategy 
we generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations primarily in japan  korea  taiwan and europe 
second  we translate our equity investment in foreign operations into us dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period end date 
to mitigate potential losses due to fluctuations in these exchange rates  for our equity investments in our international operations other than in japan and taiwan  we generally hedge a significant portion of this exposure through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
for our equity investments in our japanese and taiwanese operations  we generally hedge this exposure through a combination of issuing foreign denominated liabilities outside these operations and by holding us dollar denominated securities in the investment portfolios of these operations 
third  our international insurance operations may hold investments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of those operations on an unhedged basis in addition to the aforementioned equity hedges resulting from foreign subsidiaries investing in us dollar denominated investments 
most significantly  our japanese operations hold us dollar denominated investments in their investment portfolios in excess of our equity investment in such operations 
for a discussion of our japanese operations us dollar denominated investment holdings  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments portfolio composition  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for financial services businesses by segment international insurance and investments division 
we manage our investment foreign currency exchange rate risks  described above  within specified limits 
foreign currency exchange risks for our domestic general account investment portfolio and the unhedged portion of our equity investment in foreign subsidiaries are managed using var based analysis 
this statistical technique estimates  at a specified confidence level  the potential pre tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements 
the estimated var as of december  for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from billion to million 
the estimated var as of december  for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from billion to billion 
the average var for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured monthly at a confidence level over a one month time horizon  was million during and million during these calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a confidence level 
we discuss limitations of var models below 
the estimated var for instruments used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  the increased var for foreign currency exchange risks primarily reflects increased volatility in exchange rates for japanese yen and korean won 
derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  or the prices of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
we are also a party to financial instruments that may contain derivative instruments that are embedded in the financial instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our derivative activities as of december  and under insurance statutes  our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  as well as equity prices  and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
in addition  we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risk associated with some of our benefit features of our variable annuity contracts 
the notional amount of derivative instruments increased billion in  from billion as of december  to billion as of december   driven by an increase in interest rate derivatives  primarily due to an increase in duration management and variable annuity hedging activities 
we use credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments  and in limited instances purchase credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in our investment portfolio 
for additional information regarding our exposure to credit derivatives  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities credit derivative exposure to public fixed maturities 
trading activities we engage in trading activities primarily in connection with our derivatives trading operations 
we maintain trading positions in various foreign exchange instruments and commodities  primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients 
market risk affects the values of our trading positions through fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  securities and commodity prices 
we seek to use short security positions and forwards  futures  options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks 
we also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate  currency and other market risks 
our derivative transactions involve both exchange listed and over the counter contracts and are generally short term in duration 
we act both as a broker  buying and selling exchange listed contracts for our customers  and as a dealer  by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal 
as a broker  we assume counterparty and credit risks that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines 
as a dealer  we are subject to market risk as well as counterparty and credit risk 
we manage the market risk associated with trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies  risk and position limits  counterparty and credit limits  daily position monitoring  and other forms of risk management 
in the second quarter of  the company announced its decision to exit the equity sales  trading and research operations of the prudential equity group 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
value at risk var is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities 
we calculate a var that encompasses our trading activities using a confidence level 
the var method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed  which consist of interest rates  including credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices  estimates of volatilities from historical data  the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and the correlations of those factors 
the total var for our trading activities  which considers our combined exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities price risk  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  the largest component of this total var as of december  and was related to commodities price risk 
the total average daily var for our trading activities considering our exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities price risk  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million during and million during the largest component of both periods total average daily var was related to commodities price risk 
limitations of var models although var models are a recognized tool for risk management  they have inherent limitations  including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns 
accordingly  var models should not be viewed as a predictor of future results 
we may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time  and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our var models 
a var model does not estimate the greatest possible loss 
the results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel
