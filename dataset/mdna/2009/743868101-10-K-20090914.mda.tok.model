interest rate risk 
the principal financial objective of the corporation s interest rate risk management function is to achieve long term profitability while limiting its exposure to the fluctuation of interest rates 
the corporation  through its alco  has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by managing the repricing mismatch between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the corporation s assets by retaining loans with interest rates subject to periodic market adjustments 
in addition  the bank maintains a liquid investment portfolio primarily comprised of us government agency mbs and government sponsored enterprise mbs that reprice frequently 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funding while utilizing fhlb san francisco advances as a secondary source of funding which can be structured with favorable interest rate risk characteristics 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts 
using data from the bank s quarterly report to the ots  the ots produces a report for the bank that measures interest rate risk by modeling the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
the interest rate risk analysis received from the ots is similar to the bank s own interest rate risk model 
npv is defined as the net present value of expected future cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the calculation is intended to illustrate the change in npv that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of     and basis points with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate change 
the following table is provided by the ots and sets forth as of june  the estimated changes in npv based on the indicated interest rate environment 
the bank s balance sheet position as of june  can be summarized as follows if interest rates increase  the npv of the bank is expected to increase  except at the basis points or higher rate shock scenario  where it is expected to decrease 
basis points bp change in rates net portfolio value npv change portfolio value assets npv as percentage of portfolio value assets sensitivity measure dollars in thousands bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp bp  bp bp    bp bp    bp represents the decrease increase of the estimated npv at the indicated change in interest rates compared to the npv calculated at june  base case 
calculated as the estimated npv divided by the portfolio value of total assets 
calculated as the change in the npv ratio from the base case at the indicated change in interest rates 
the following table provided by the ots  is based on the calculations contained in the previous table  and sets forth the change in the npv at a basis point rate shock at june  and at a basis point rate shock at june  by regulation the bank must measure and manage its interest rate risk for an interest rate shock of basis points and basis points  whichever produces the largest decline in npv 
at june  at june  risk measure bp rate shock bp bp pre shock npv ratio post shock npv ratio sensitivity measure bp bp thrift bulletin a level of risk minimal minimal as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing characteristics  they may react in different degrees to changes in interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals of time deposits could likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the respective results 
it is also possible that  as a result of an interest rate increase  the increased mortgage payments required of arm borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults 
changes in interest rates could also affect the volume and profitability of the bank s mortgage banking operations 
accordingly  the data presented in the tables above should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates 
furthermore  the npv presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair market value of the bank  nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to stockholders in the event of the liquidation of the corporation 
the bank also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the month period subsequent to any given month end assuming a dynamic balance sheet accounting for the bank s current balance sheet  month business plan  embedded options  rate floors  periodic caps  lifetime caps  and loan  investment  deposit and borrowing cash flows  among others  and immediate  permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of plus or minus and basis points 
the following table describes the results of the analysis for june  and june  june  june  basis point bp change in basis point bp change in change in rates net interest income change in rates net interest income bp bp bp bp bp bp bp nm bp for the fiscal year ended june  the bank is asset sensitive as its interest earning assets are expected to reprice more quickly than its interest bearing liabilities during the subsequent month period 
therefore  in a rising interest rate environment  the model projects an increase in net interest income over the subsequent month period 
in a falling interest rate environment  the results also project a slight increase in net interest income over the subsequent month period  except in the basis point scenario where net interest income was not forecast 
for the fiscal year ended june   the bank is liability sensitive  as its interest bearing liabilities are expected to reprice more quickly during the subsequent month period than its interest earning assets 
therefore  in a rising interest rate environment  the model projects a decline in net interest income over the subsequent month period 
in a falling interest rate environment  the results project an increase in net interest income over the subsequent month period 
management believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable 
however  past experience has shown that immediate  permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not necessarily occur 
additionally  while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in interest rates  actual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete the analysis 
therefore the model results that we disclose should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of the corporation s current disclosure to previous disclosures  over time  within the context of the actual performance of the treasury yield curve
