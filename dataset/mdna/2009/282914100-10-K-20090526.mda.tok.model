item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of common stock in we develop and market telecommunication services for internet protocol  or ip  telephony and video applications 
we offer the x broadband voip and video communications service  x virtual office service  x trunking service  x hosted key system service  videophone equipment and services  and the x mobiletalk service 
we shipped our first voip product in  launched our x service in november  the x virtual office business service offering in march and the x mobiletalk service in november as of march   we had more than  x residential and videophone customers and more than  business customers in service 
since fiscal  substantially all of our revenues have been generated from the sale  license and provision of voip products  services and technology 
prior to fiscal  our focus was on our voip semiconductor business 
critical accounting policies estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual future results may differ from our estimates 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  valuation of inventories  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included above under item a  risk factors 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under the terms of our typical subscription agreement  new customers can terminate their service within days of order placement and receive a full refund of fees previously paid 
we have determined that we have sufficient history of subscriber conduct to make a reasonable estimate of cancellations within the day trial period 
therefore  we recognize new subscriber revenue in the month in which the new order was shipped  net of an allowance for expected cancellations 
emerging issues task force eitf consensus no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet specific criteria 
in addition  arrangement consideration must be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with certain limitations 
the provisioning of the x service with the accompanying desktop terminal or videophone adapter constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with the guidance of eitf no 
 we allocate x revenues  including activation fees  among the desktop terminal adapter  virtual office phone  or videophone and subscriber services 
subsequent to the subscriber s initial purchase of the services  revenues allocated to the desktop terminal adapter  virtual office phone or videophone are recognized as product revenues during the period of the sale less the allowance for estimated returns during the day trial period 
all other revenues are recognized when the related services are provided 
the cost of the products sold is recognized contemporaneously with the recognition of revenue 
at the time of each revenue transaction  we assess whether the revenue amount is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we defer recognition of revenue on product sales to retailers where the right of return exists until products are resold to the end user and the trial period has expired 
during fiscal  and  revenues from software licensing and related arrangements were limited 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we have allocated revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we defer revenue from the arranged fee that is equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for our technology licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
we base the fair value of services  such as training or consulting  on separate sales of these services to other customers 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
under our revenue recognition accounting principles  if a software license arrangement includes acceptance criteria  we do not recognize revenue until we can demonstrate objectively that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or that the customer has signed formal acceptance documentation 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  we recognize revenue on a subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
for all sales  except those completed via the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or other signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement  and recognize revenue upon settlement of the transaction  if there are no customer acceptance conditions 
we do not settle credit card transactions until equipment related to the transaction  if any  is shipped to a customer 
our ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed above under item a  risk factors 
collectability of accounts receivable we must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  including historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of march   the accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  including a reserve for disputed credits  and an estimated returns reserve of  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and replacement costs 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
acquired product rights on april   we resolved a patent litigation matter with web telephony by entering into a license and settlement agreement that resolved all legal claims by web telephony 
as part of the settlement  we will pay eight quarterly payments over the next two years 
under the transaction  we expensed  of the patent settlement costs during the year ended march  that were related to benefits received by us in and during the periods prior to fiscal year the remaining license fee was recorded as other long term assets as of march  and is being amortized to cost of service revenues in the consolidated statements of operations over the remaining life of the primary patent  which expires in september warrant liability we account for our warrants in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock eitf which requires warrants to be classified as permanent equity  temporary equity or as assets or liabilities 
in general  warrants that either require net cash settlement or are presumed to require net cash settlement are recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and warrants that require settlement in shares are recorded as equity instruments 
certain of our warrants require settlement in shares and are accounted for as permanent equity 
we also have two investor warrants that are classified as liabilities because they include a provision that specifies that we must deliver freely tradable shares upon exercise by the warrant holder 
because there are circumstances  irrespective of likelihood  which may not be within our control that could prevent delivery of registered shares  eitf requires the warrants be recorded as a liability at fair value  with subsequent changes in fair value recorded as income loss in change in fair value of warrant liability 
the fair value of the warrant is determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual term 
the amount we record as a liability under eitf is not  nor do we intend for it to be an admission or stipulation of the amount that we would owe or be obligated to pay the warrant holder in the event of an actual breach by us of the warrant terms 
in fact  we have made no determination of the amount of liability  if any  that we would owe to the warrant holder in the event of such a breach 
income and other taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax expense and to assess temporary differences resulting from book tax accounting differences for items such as deferred revenue 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required to determine the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which consist of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize most of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we have received inquiries  demands or audit requests from several states and municipal taxing and agencies seeking payment of taxes that are applied to or collected from the customers of providers of traditional public switched telephone network services 
we have recorded an expense of  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively  as our estimate of the increase in probable tax exposure for such assessments 
our cumulative estimate for probable assessments is million as of march   which is recorded in the accrued taxes line item in the consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation effective april   we account for our employee stock options and stock purchase rights granted under the stock plan  director option plan  nonstatutory stock option plan and the stock plan and stock purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plan purchase plan under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting under statement for certain employee stock purchase plans with a look back option and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant  net of estimated forfeitures 
we have adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas no 
r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
prior to april   we accounted for stock based awards in accordance with apb  whereby the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value on the date of grant  or the intrinsic value  is recognized as compensation expense 
under the intrinsic value method of accounting  no compensation expense generally was recognized when the exercise price of the employee stock option grants equaled the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
however  to the extent awards were granted either below fair market value or were modified which required a re measurement of compensation costs  we recorded compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal included both the unvested portion of stock based awards granted prior to april  and stock based awards granted subsequent to april  stock options granted in periods prior to fiscal were measured based on sfas no 
criteria  whereas stock options granted subsequent to april  were measured based on sfas no 
r criteria 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to april  has been recognized using the straight line single option method 
stock based compensation expense included in fiscal included the impact of estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
to value option grants and stock purchase rights under the purchase plan for actual and pro forma stock based compensation we used the black scholes option valuation model 
fair value determined using the black scholes option valuation model varies based on assumptions used for the expected stock prices volatility  expected life  risk free interest rates and future dividend payments 
for fiscal years  and  we used the historical volatility of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the options to their fair value 
the expected life assumptions represent the weighted average period stock based awards are expecting to remain outstanding 
these expected life assumptions were established through the review of historical exercise behavior of stock based award grants with similar vesting periods 
the risk free interest was based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded us treasury securities in the over the counter market for the expected term equal to the expected term of the option 
the dividend yield assumption was based on our history and expectation of future dividend payout 
sfas no 
r requires us to calculate the additional paid in capital pool apic pool available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting sfas no 
r  as if we had adopted sfas no 
at its effective date of january  there are two allowable methods to calculate our apic pool the long form method as set forth in sfas no 
r or the short form method as set forth in fasb staff position no 
r we have elected to use the long form method under which we track each award grant on an employee by employee basis and grant by grant basis to determine if there is a tax benefit or tax deficiency for such award 
we then compared the fair value expense to the tax deduction received for each grant and aggregated the benefits and deficiencies to establish the apic pool 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  some exercises result in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant  or windfalls 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  we are not recognizing deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from april  onward 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the company upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that the company had recorded 
we use the with and without approach as described in emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
d  in determining the order in which our tax attributes are utilized 
the with and without approach results in the recognition of the windfall stock option tax benefits only after all other tax attributes of ours have been considered in the annual tax accrual computation 
also  we have elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of share based compensation deductions in computing our research and development tax and as such  we recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs 
on january   our board of directors approved the acceleration of unvested stock options to purchase  shares of common stock 
 of these shares are subject to options held by our executive officers and directors 
these options of our executive officers and directors  taken as a whole  have a weighted average exercise price of per share and range from to per share  and a weighted average remaining vesting term of years 
approximately million of the million stock based compensation charge in the fourth quarter of applies to the options held by our executive officers and directors 
selected operating statistics we periodically review certain key business metrics  within the context of our articulated performance goals  in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business

business customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of business customers that terminated after the expiration of the day trial during that period by the simple average number of business customers during the period and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of business customers during the period is the number of business customers on the first day of the period plus the number of business customers on the last day of the period divided by two 
business customers are defined as customers paying for service 
prior to april   x included customers in the business customer count that were using the service as a trial or evaluation and not yet paying for service 
the numbers in this table prior to and after april   only include business customers that are paying for service 
customers that have prepaid for their first month of service and are currently in the day trial period are considered to be customers that are paying for service 
business customer average monthly service revenue per customer is service revenue from business customers in the period divided by the number of months in the period divided by the simple average number of business customers during the period 
total business  residential and video subscriber acquisition cost per service is defined as the combined costs of advertising  marketing  promotions  commissions and equipment subsidies during the period divided by the number of gross services added during the period 
business subscriber acquisition cost per service is defined as the combined costs of advertising  marketing  promotions  commissions and equipment subsidies for business services sold during the period divided by the number of gross business services added during the period 
the addition of  avtex customers that migrated to x in the second fiscal quarter of but subscribed to find me  follow me services rather than x virtual office service  and the  in expense related to the acquisition of these  customers  is excluded from this calculation 
business customer subscriber acquisition cost is business subscriber acquisition cost per service times the average number of services subscribed to per business customer 
total business  residential and video customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of services terminated after the expiration of the day trial during that period by the simple average number of services during the period and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
we believe it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as we do not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
revenues year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands service revenues     percentage of total revenues service revenues consist primarily of revenues attributable to the provision of our x services and royalties earned under our voip technology licenses 
we expect that x service revenues will continue to comprise nearly all of our service revenues for the foreseeable future 
the increase in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  was primarily attributable to a million increase in x service revenues resulting from the growth of our business service subscriber base 
our business service subscriber base grew from approximately  customers at the end of fiscal to approximately  customers on march  the increase was offset by a decrease of million attributable to residential and videophone services and a million decrease in revenue attributable to royalties earned 
the decrease in service revenues from residential and video customers resulted from a reduction in the number of residential and video lines in service from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal also  compared with fiscal  there was a million reduction in the one time recognition of revenue due to a ruling by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia in june that interconnected voip providers are not required to obtain pre approval of traffic studies 
as a result of the ruling  in the first quarter of fiscal we retroactively applied our traffic study contribution rate to our historical subscriber retail revenues which resulted in the recognition of revenue of million from the reduction of the related accrued liability in the first fiscal quarter of the increase in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  was primarily attributable to an million increase in x service revenues resulting from the growth in the business service subscriber base and an increase in the price of our service instituted on march  the business service subscriber base grew from approximately  customers at the end of fiscal to approximately  on march  our residential customer base did not significantly change between the end of fiscal and  as the decline in our existing customer base was offset by the transition of a competitor s former customers to the x residential service 
while service revenues increased during fiscal our wholesale service and royalty revenues declined by million primarily due to the termination of our agreement with bellsouth in the fourth fiscal quarter of in connection with its merger with at t 
year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands product revenues    percentage of total revenues product revenues consist of revenues from sales of voip terminal adapters  telephones and videophones  primarily attributable to our x service 
the increase in fiscal year from fiscal year resulted from a million increase in product revenue attributable to growth in our business customer subscriber base 
however  product revenue attributable to residential and video service customers declined by million 
the decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily attributable to a million decrease in product revenue attributable to residential customers as we redirected our marketing away from residential customers to marketing our services to small businesses 
in addition  we waived the regular start up costs  which include the equipment cost associated with residential service plans  as part of the transition of a competitor s former customers to the x service 
the decrease in residential customer product revenues during fiscal was partially offset by an increase of million in product revenue attributable to the growth in our business customer subscriber base 
no single customer represented more than of our total revenues during fiscal  or the following table illustrates our net revenues by geographic area 
revenues are attributed to countries based on the destination of shipment in thousands years ended march  united states    other locations cost of revenues year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands cost of service revenues    percentage of service revenues the cost of service revenues primarily consist of costs associated with network operations and related personnel  telephony origination and termination services provided by third party carriers and technology license and royalty expenses 
cost of service revenues for fiscal compared with fiscal decreased primarily due to a reduction in pricing by third party network service vendors and our use of multiple third party network provider vendors  which allows us to route call traffic to the third party network provider vendor with the most favorable pricing 
the reduction in pricing by third party network service vendors was partially offset by an increase in personnel and licenses fee costs compared with the prior fiscal year 
cost of service revenues for fiscal compared with fiscal decreased million also due to a price reduction by third party network service vendors and our switch to the use of multiple third party network provider vendors throughout fiscal and the cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues decreased substantially from fiscal to fiscal due to a reduction in pricing by third party network service vendors combined with an increase in the percentage of total revenue from business customers 
the cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues is less for business customers than for residential customers 
year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands cost of product revenues    percentage of product revenues the cost of product revenues consist of costs associated with systems  components  system manufacturing  assembly and testing performed by third party vendors  estimated warranty obligations and direct and indirect costs associated with product purchasing  scheduling  quality assurance  shipping and handling 
we generally do not charge residential subscribers for the terminal adapters used to provide our service when they subscribe through our website 
we also have offered incentives to customers who purchase terminal adapters and telephones in our retail channels to offset the customer s cost of the equipment purchased from a retailer 
we allocate a portion of service revenues to product revenues but these revenues are less than the cost of the terminal adapters 
the increase in the cost of product revenues for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in the shipment of equipment to our business customers 
the increase in cost of product revenues was partially offset by a million decrease in shipments of equipment to residential subscribers and a million reduction in freight costs 
the cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues decreased in part due to a reduction in discounting of product sales by our sales force in fiscal the decrease in the cost of product revenues for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million reduction in shipments of residential and videophone equipment and a million reduction in product reserves as we eliminated a royalty expense accrual after determining that we were unlikely to pay such royalties in the future 
cost of product revenues during fiscal included an increase of million for shipments of equipment attributable to growth in our business customer subscriber base and a million increase in costs from the write off of equipment shipped to a failed retailer 
the cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenue increased due to an increase in shipments of equipment to residential subscribers who switched to our service when one of our competitors shut down and terminated its service offering 
research and development expenses year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands research and development    percentage of total revenues historically  our research and development expenses have consisted primarily of personnel  system prototype design  and equipment costs necessary for us to conduct our development and engineering efforts 
we expense research and development costs  including software development costs  as they are incurred 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and contractor headcount expenses  including a million increase in sfas r stock based compensation expense 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to a million decrease in contractor headcount expenses 
in addition  departures by employees that we did not replace in fiscal reduced total research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  customer support  finance  human resources and general management 
such costs also include outsourced customer service call center operations  sales commissions  as well as trade show  advertising and other marketing and promotional expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in employee and temporary personnel costs  including a million increase in sfas r stock based compensation expense  million increase in advertising  public relations and other marketing and promotional expenses  a million increase in travel and meal expenses  a million increase in printing expenses  and a million increase in expensed equipment and software 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in sales agent and retailer commissions  a million decrease in sales and use tax expenses as we began to collect and remit taxes in states outside of california  a million decrease in accounting and tax fees  and a million decrease in credit card processing fees 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in additional employee and temporary personnel costs and a million increase in advertising  public relations  and other marketing and promotional expenses 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in sales agent and retailer commissions and a million decrease in sales and use tax expenses as we began to collect and remit taxes in states outside of california 
interest income and other  net year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands interest income and other  net   percentage of total revenues our interest income and other  net  primarily consists of interest and investment income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
this item consisted of interest income alone in other income in fiscal included million from the sale of two patents 
the increase in other income for fiscal from fiscal consists primarily of million from the sale of two patents offset by a reduction in interest and investment income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances of million due to lower average cash balances and interest rates 
income on change in fair value of warrant liability year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands income on change in fair value of warrant liability    percentage of total revenues in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock in fiscal and  we issued warrants in three different equity financings 
the warrants included a provision that we must deliver freely tradable shares upon exercise of the warrant 
because there are circumstances that may not be within our control that could prevent delivery of registered shares  eitf requires the warrants be recorded as a liability at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss 
the fair value of the warrant is determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual term 
to the extent that the fair value of the warrant liability increases or decreases  we record a loss or income in our statement of operations 
the amount we record as a liability under eitf is not  nor do we intend for it to be  an admission or stipulation of the amount that we would owe or be obligated to pay the warrant holder in the event of an actual breach by us of the warrant terms 
in fact  we have made no determination of the amount of liability  if any  that we would owe to the warrant holder in the event of such a breach 
the decrease in the income from change in fair value of warrants in fiscal from fiscal occurred because the fair value of warrants and warrant liability declined due to a reduction in our stock price  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and contractual life of the warrants which are the primary assumptions applied to the black scholes model which we have used to calculate the fair value of the warrants 
the decrease in the income from change in fair value of warrants in fiscal from fiscal occurred because the fair value of warrants and warrant liability declined due to a reduction in our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual life of the warrants 
furthermore  on august   we and the warrant holders amended the terms of warrants to purchase  shares of common stock that we had classified as liabilities 
the amended warrants met the requirement to be classified as equity and accordingly  they were reclassified from liability to equity 
a total of million of the income from the change in fair value of the warrants in fiscal was related to the amended warrants and million was reclassified from liability to equity 
the remaining investor warrants for  shares of common stock issued on december  have not been amended and will continue to be accounted for as liabilities until exercised or expiration in december provision for income taxes year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands provision for income taxes percentage of total revenues we had a  provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended march  for state tax in several states and foreign withholding tax on royalty revenue 
we had no provision for income taxes in the fiscal years ended march  and at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  that expire at various dates beginning in and continuing through in addition  at march   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in continuing through  while the california credit will carry forward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  we have applied a full valuation allowance as of march  and liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
by comparison  at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and million in investments for a combined total of million 
we currently have no borrowing arrangements 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased million and the combined balance increased by million during fiscal the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments was primarily attributable to a million of cash from operating activities  and million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans  partially offset by million of capital expenditures  as discussed below 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared with million provided by operating activities for fiscal the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal resulted primarily from a net loss of million  a million adjustment for stock compensation  which includes million due to the acceleration of unvested employee stock options in january  a million adjustment for depreciation  a million reduction in accounts receivable related to the payment by nationwide retailers and software licensing and royalty customers  a million reduction in deferred cost of goods sold primarily related to sell thru of equipment by retailers and net retailer returns  a million increase in other current and noncurrent liabilities primarily due to a license and settlement agreement  a million provision for inventory primarily due to million of excess inventory related to our business services analog phone  a million provision for doubtful accounts primarily related to royalty revenue  and a million write off of our legacy billing system recorded as other adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities 
this was reduced by a million increase in inventory due to the procurement of the new business ip phones launched in july  timing of receipt of inventory and net retailer returns  a reduction of million due to payment of accrued sales tax  a net million increase in accrued taxes  a million decrease in deferred revenue related to cash collections of million from annual service plans in which the customer pre pays for months of service offset by a million recognition of deferred annual plan revenue  a million reduction related to sell thru of equipment by retailers and net retailer returns  and a million increase in other current and noncurrent assets primarily related to acquired product rights 
the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal resulted primarily from a million decrease in inventory due to lower inventory levels of customer premise equipment cpe  a million increase in accrued taxes  a million increase in deferred revenue related to cash collections of million from annual plan subscriptions primarily due to the transition of a competitor s former customers to the x residential annual plan service offset by recognition of million of annual plan revenue  net of million non cash items including depreciation and amortization  stock compensation expense  and change in fair value of warrant liability 
this was reduced by a million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to retailer transactions 
although we have achieved positive cash flows from operations in the fiscal year ended march  and  historical net losses and negative cash flows have been funded primarily through the issuance of equity securities and borrowings 
we believe that current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months 
however  we continually evaluate our cash needs and may pursue additional equity or debt financing in order to achieve our overall business objectives 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available  or  if available  at a price or terms that are acceptable to us 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our longer term business objectives 
in addition  any such financing may be materially dilutive to our existing stockholders 
contractual obligations future operating lease payments  net of sublease income  capital lease payments and purchase obligations at march  for the next five years were as follows in thousands year ending march  total capital leases office leases license fee purchase obligations third party customer support provider  open purchase orders  in april  june and march  we entered into a series of noncancelable five year capital lease agreements for office equipment bearing interest at various rates 
assets under capital lease at march  totaled  with accumulated amortization of  we lease our primary facility in santa clara  california under a non cancelable operating lease that expires in fiscal we also have a leased facility in france 
on may   we entered into a three year lease for a new primary facility in sunnyvale  california 
the facility leases include rent escalation clauses and require us to pay utilities and normal maintenance costs 
rent expense is reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
we entered into a new contract with one of our third party customer support vendors containing a minimum monthly commitment of approximately  the agreement requires day notice to terminate 
the total remaining obligation under the contract is million 
at march  we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
these purchase commitments are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods or services 
subsequent to year end  in april  the company entered into a license and settlement agreement 
the agreement requires the company to pay eight quarterly payments over the next two years 
the total remaining obligation under the contract is million at march   we had a  liability related to warrants issued to two investors in an equity financing transaction in fiscal the warrants expire in december we account for these warrants as liabilities because of the possibility  however likely or unlikely  that we would be unable to deliver registered shares upon a future exercise of these warrants 
the required accounting for a warrant with an assumed net cash settlement provision under eitf is to estimate the fair value on the date of issuance and to record a liability equal to that value with subsequent changes in the fair value recorded as income or expense at the end of each reporting period under eitf 
the amount we record as a liability under eitf is not  nor do we intend for it to be  an admission or stipulation of the amount that we would owe or be obligated to pay the warrant holder in the event that we are unable to deliver registered shares to the warrant holder 
in fact  we have made no determination of the amount of liability  if any  that we would owe to the warrant holder in the event of such a breach

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
during the years ended march  and  we did not have any outstanding debt instruments other than equipment under capital leases and  therefore  we were not exposed to market risk relating to interest rates
