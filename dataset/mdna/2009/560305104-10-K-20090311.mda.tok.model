management overview we are a global intimate apparel company with a portfolio of established  well known brands  top selling products and an iconic heritage 
we design  source and market an extensive range of intimate apparel products  including bras  panties and shapewear 
we sell through multiple distribution channels  including department stores and national chain stores  mass merchants including warehouse clubs  other including specialty retailers  off price retailers and licensing income  our company operated outlet stores and our websites 
we sell our products under some of the most recognized brands in the intimate apparel industry 
our maidenform  flexees  lilyette  control it  luleh  rendezvous  subtract and private brands are sold in department stores and national chain stores 
our sweet nothings  inspirations  bodymates  self expressions  as well as private brands are distributed through mass merchants 
these other brands leverage our product technology  but are separate brands with distinctly different logos 
in addition to our owned brands  we also supply private brand products to selected retailers 
trends in our business we operate in two segments  wholesale and retail 
our wholesale segment includes both our domestic and international wholesale markets 
our retail segment includes our company operated outlet stores and our websites 
we have identified near term opportunities for growth and operational improvements  as well as challenges  including general macro economic conditions that may affect our customers and our business 
in particular  management believes that there are many factors influencing the intimate apparel industry  including but not limited to consistent demand for foundation garments  consumer demand for product innovation and leading brands  sourcing and supply chain efficiencies  continued growth of the mass merchant channel  pressure from retailers brought about by the consolidation in the retail industry  increases in the cost of the raw materials used in intimate apparel products and uncertainty surrounding import restrictions 
form k i management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on or address these trends by  among other things increasing consumer identification with our brands through further marketing investments  continuing to launch innovative products  increasing our presence in department stores and national chain stores through the use of maidenform  flexees  lilyette  control it  luleh  rendezvous  subtract and private brands  adding new higher end distribution with our new women s intimate apparel license agreement for the donna karan and dkny brands that will commence in  increasing our presence in the mass merchant channel through the use of our sweet nothings  bodymates  self expressions  inspirations  private brands and other brands for new customers  expanding our international presence  being a marketer  rather than a manufacturer of our brands  making selective acquisitions  entering into licenses  and developing products and marketing that will complement our existing products or distribution channels  and merchandising  marketing and selling private brand product for selected retailers 
wholesale segment department stores and national chain stores 
the department stores and national chain stores are where we generally sell the maidenform  flexees and lilyette brands 
we plan to continue to invest in increasing our net sales with department store customers  which we believe is important to our long term positioning in the channel 
there has been a trend toward consolidation of department stores 
we expect the rate of our future net sales growth with department stores to be moderated by the reduction in both the number of department store customers and the number of doors distinct locations operated by a particular retailer operated by these customers 
we have grown both our market share and our net sales significantly in the past several years with national chain stores 
we have customers located outside the united states that purchase our maidenform  flexees and lilyette brands 
the majority of these net sales are included in the department stores and national chain stores channel 
commencing  we expect to add new customers within this channel as a result of our new women s intimate apparel license agreement for the donna karan and dkny brands 
this agreement grants us the rights to design  source and market a full collection of donna karan and dkny women s intimate apparel products 
mass merchants 
the mass merchant channel includes both mass merchants and warehouse clubs 
we intend to improve our penetration with mass merchants through the use of our brands sweet nothings  inspirations  bodymates  self expressions  as well as private brands 
we have experienced significant growth in this channel over the past several years and expect to achieve significant growth in the future as we are able to increase both the floor space and number of doors at which our products are sold 
we expect that both our net sales to this channel and our net sales to this channel as a percentage of our total net sales are likely to increase over time 
the volume and mix of net sales of our brands and of private label in the mass merchant channel can vary from period to period based upon strategic changes that our customers may implement from time to time 
net sales to customers in the mass channel that are located outside the united states are included in this channel 
other 
our net sales from this channel  which include sales to specialty retailers and to off price retailers  have historically been a relatively small component of our overall net sales 
we participate in private brands in the specialty retailer area as opportunities i maidenform brands  inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued present themselves 
we continually evaluate this channel for opportunities 
licensing income is included in this channel as well as our sales to foreign distributors 
we may selectively target strategic acquisitions  licensing opportunities and a brand start up to grow our consumer base and would utilize the acquired companies and licenses to complement the products  channels and geographic reach of our existing portfolio 
we believe that acquisitions and licenses can enhance our product offerings to retailers and provide growth opportunities 
we believe we can leverage our core competencies such as product development  brand management  logistics and marketing to create significant value from the acquired businesses and licenses 
on may   we entered into a new women s intimate apparel license agreement for the donna karan and dkny brands 
retail segment we believe our retail sales volume is driven by our ability to service our existing consumers and obtain new consumers  as well as overall general macro economic conditions that can affect our consumers and ultimately their levels of overall spending and choice of retail channel for their purchases 
additionally  identifying optimal retail outlet locations  favorable leasing arrangements  and improving our store productivity are factors important to growing our retail segment s net sales 
we also sell our products through our websites  www 
maidenform 
com and www 
maidenform 
co 
uk 
although we currently do not generate a significant amount of net sales through these sites  we do expect it to continue to grow 
our objectives in our retail segment are to continue to increase the productivity of our portfolio of stores through effective merchandising and focused advertising  as well as selectively closing less productive locations and potentially opening new stores in more productive locations 
even in those situations where we selectively close less productive outlet stores and do not open a new store in that region  we believe those consumers still purchase many of our maidenform brands from our other outlet stores  our websites or our wholesale segment customers that carry these brands 
historically  we have primarily sold excess and  to a lesser extent  obsolete inventories through our outlet stores at a higher margin than that achieved through other liquidation alternatives 
definitions in reviewing our operating performance  we evaluate both the wholesale and retail segments by focusing on each segment s operating income  cash flows from operations and inventory turns 
net sales 
our net sales are derived from two operating segments  wholesale and retail 
our net sales in the wholesale segment are sales recorded net of cooperative advertising allowances  sales returns  sales discounts  and markdown allowances provided to our customers 
net sales in our retail segment are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise at the point of sale in our stores and for our internet sales  net sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to the customer 
cost of sales 
we outsource all manufacturing of the products we sell and  therefore  the principal elements of our cost of sales are for finished goods inventories purchased from our sourced vendors 
included in cost of sales and affecting our overall gross margins are freight expenses from the manufacturers to our distribution centers in situations where such expenses are charged separately 
also included in cost of sales is the cost of warehousing  labor and overhead related to receiving and warehousing at our distribution centers  and depreciation of assets related to our receiving and warehousing in our distribution centers 
direct labor  cost of fabrics  as well as raw materials for fabrics  are the primary components driving the overall cost of our sourced finished goods inventories from our sourcing vendors 
form k i management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
our sg a include all of our marketing  product development  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses for both the wholesale and retail segments which include our retail outlet store payroll and related benefits  and rent expense 
general and administrative expenses include management payroll  benefits  travel  information systems  accounting  distribution  insurance and legal costs 
additionally  depreciation related to the shipping function in our distribution centers and our corporate office assets such as furniture  fixtures  and equipment  as well as amortization of intellectual property  is included in sg a 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which recognizes the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of the events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
for those uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the tax benefit 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are also recorded 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization and record a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
for more information  see notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
net operating loss carryforwards nols enable a company to apply net operating losses incurred during a current period against a future period s profits in order to reduce cash tax liabilities in those future periods 
in periods when a company is generating operating losses  its nols will increase 
the tax effect of the nols is recorded as a deferred tax asset 
if the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the nols  it records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
additionally  section imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize its nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain existing stockholders and  or  new stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points during a three year testing period 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years  and the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased to reflect both recognized and deemed recognized built in gains that occur during the sixty month period after the ownership change 
upon emergence from bankruptcy in  our nols were subject to section limitations 
as a result of the acquisition  we experienced a change in control as defined by section as a result of this ownership change  the utilization of our nols were subject to a new annual limitation under section subsequent to the acquisition  sales of our shares by others  including the initial public offering in july  have resulted in additional changes in control for the purpose of section  however  the annual limitation of our nols has not changed 
based on fair values of certain assets as determined in connection with the acquisition  we had approximately million of deemed built in gains that are anticipated to be recognized or deemed recognized during the aforementioned sixty month period

our net sales within the wholesale segment are grouped by channel  based upon the brands we sell and the customers to whom we sell them  as follows department stores and national chain stores  mass merchants and other 
our department stores and national chain stores channel primarily consists of sales of our maidenform  flexees  lilyette  control it  luleh  rendezvous  subtract and private brands on a worldwide basis to customers within this category 
within the mass merchant channel  we sell brands such as sweet nothings  inspirations  bodymates  self expressions and private brands that are primarily dedicated to specific customers 
these brands are all sold on a worldwide basis to mass merchants and  to a lesser degree  warehouse clubs 
our remaining sales are grouped within a channel designated as other and include private brand products sold to specialty retailers and all brand sales to off price retail stores

further deterioration in the financial markets could lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers  contract manufacturers or trade customers and consequently  could disrupt our business

we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in our notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that require our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers 
we provide reserves for accounts receivable that may not be realized as a result of uncollectibility  sales returns  markdowns  and other customer allowances 
reserves are determined based on historical experience  credit quality  age of accounts receivable balances  and economic conditions that may form k i management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued affect a customer s ability to pay 
we believe that our reserves provide reasonable assurance that such balances are reflected at net realizable value 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of wholesale inventory is based on standard costs  which approximate first in  first out fifo  while the cost of product acquired from third parties for sale through our retail segment is based on the retail inventory method 
we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are evaluated by us for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances exist 
we evaluated goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of and determined that no impairment exists 
we allocate our goodwill to our reporting units 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
to determine the fair values  we use both a discounted cash flow approach and a market approach 
in reviewing intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment  we compare the carrying amount of such asset to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value using discounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset 
when the estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the asset s fair value and its carrying amount 
in addition  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the performance of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests are subject to significant judgment in determining the estimation of future cash flows  the estimation of discount rates  and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  and intangible assets with finite lives  are periodically reviewed and evaluated by us when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets  this evaluation is based on the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the related assets 
should such evaluation result in us concluding that the carrying amount of long lived assets has been impaired  an appropriate write down to their fair value is recorded 
revenue recognition 
net sales from the wholesale segment are recognized when merchandise is shipped to customers  at which time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer and persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
in the case of sales by our retail operations  net sales are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise at the point of sale in our stores and for our internet sales  net sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to the customer 
reserves for sales returns  markdown allowances  cooperative advertising  discounts and other customer deductions are provided when sales are recorded or when the commitment is incurred 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method which recognizes the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of the events that i maidenform brands  inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
for those uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the tax benefit 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are also recorded 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization and record a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
this assessment requires us to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
accrued expenses 
accrued expenses for health insurance  workers compensation insurance  incentive compensation  professional fees  and other outstanding obligations are based on actual commitments 
these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
benefit plans including postretirement plans 
the long term rate of return for our pension plan is established via a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing 
historical markets are studied and long term historical relationships between equity and fixed income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
current market factors  such as inflation and interest rates  are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
we employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk 
risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status  and corporate financial condition 
the assets of our pension plan are held in pooled separate accounts and are invested in mutual funds consisting of a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities 
we use this investment approach in order to meet its diversification and asset allocation goals 
furthermore  equity investments are diversified across domestic and foreign stocks  as well as growth  value  and small and large capitalizations 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews  annual liability measurements  and periodic asset liability studies 
the pension plan did not require a minimum contribution for at january   we decreased the discount rate assumption from to for the pension plan to reflect changes in the index fund that closely matches our expected pension benefit payouts 
at january   we used a long term rate of return assumption of based on the investment return of our pension plan assets  which are primarily in equity securities 
effective on january   the company s pension plan was frozen 
see notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the postretirement medical plans are unfunded plans 
we expect to contribute to the plans an amount equal to benefit payments to be made in which are estimated to be million 
changes in assumptions related to our postretirement plans would not materially impact our consolidated statements of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits fsp r 
fsp r requires enhanced disclosures about the plan assets of a company s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the enhanced disclosures required by this fsp are intended to provide users of financial statements with a greater understanding of how investment allocation decisions are made  including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies  the major categories of plan assets  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the effect of fair value measurements using significant form k i management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued unobservable inputs level on changes in plan assets for the period  and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets

fsp amends the factors to be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
its intent is to improve the consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure its fair value 
this fsp is effective prospectively for intangible assets acquired or renewed on january  and thereafter 
we do not expect fsp to have a material impact on our accounting for future acquisitions of intangible assets

to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope 
fsp no 
delays the effective date of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities would include all assets and liabilities other than those meeting the definition of a financial asset or financial liability as defined in paragraph of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
our significant nonfinancial assets and liabilities include assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in connection with an acquisition and our intangible assets and goodwill are tested annually for impairment 
fsp no 
defers the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of fsp no 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that fsp no 
will have on our consolidated statements of financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
it also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of a company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which a company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
we adopted this statement as of december  and elected not to apply the fair value option to any of our financial instruments 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
enhances the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard is effective beginning in our fiscal year 
since sfas no 
requires only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging activities  adoption of sfas no 
will not affect our consolidated statements of financial position  results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we do not believe that we have significant foreign currency transactional exposures 
our net sales for the years ended  and in currencies other than us dollars were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during the years  and  our net sales were favorably impacted by million  million and million  respectively  due to foreign exchange rates 
most of our purchases are denominated in us dollars 
the impact of a unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of the foreign currencies in which we have transactional exposures would be immaterial 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed through a combination of variable and fixed rate debt 
the objective is to maintain a cost effective mix that we deem appropriate and we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement to maintain this balance 
at january   our debt portfolio was composed of variable rate debt of which we hedge approximately at a fixed rate 
with respect to our variable rate debt  a change in interest rates would have had a million impact on our interest expense for  a million impact on our interest expense for and a million impact on our interest expense for commodity price risk 
we are subject primarily to commodity price risk arising from fluctuations in the market prices of raw materials used in the garments purchased from our sourcing vendors if they pass along these increased costs 
during the past five years  there has been no significant impact from commodity price fluctuations  nor do we currently use derivative instruments in the management of these risks 
on a going forward basis  fluctuations in crude oil prices or petroleum based product prices may also influence the prices of the related items such as chemicals  dyestuffs  man made fibers and foam  and transportation costs 
any raw material price increase would increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass our higher costs on to our customers 
inflation risk 
we are affected by inflation and changing prices from our suppliers primarily through the cost of raw materials  increased operating costs and expenses  and fluctuations in interest rates 
the effects of inflation on our net sales and operations have not been material in recent years 
we do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the future  volatile crude oil and gasoline prices may impact our product and freight costs  consumer confidence and disposable income 
seasonality 
we have not experienced any significant seasonal fluctuations in our net sales or our profitability
