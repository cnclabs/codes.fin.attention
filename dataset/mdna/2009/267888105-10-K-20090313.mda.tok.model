item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes  as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
unless stated otherwise  all dollar figures in this discussion are presented in thousands s 
executive overview prior to late  our business had been organized into two segments explosive metalworking which we also refer to as dmc clad and amk welding 
on november   we acquired ownership of a german company  dynaenergetics 
dynaenergetics operates two distinct businesses which have historically been known as dynaplat and dynawell 
dynaplat is a manufacturer of explosion clad products similar to those manufactured by dmc clad  and its operating results from the date of acquisition are included in our explosive metalworking segment 
dynawell manufactures a number of products for the perforation of oil and gas wells and also distributes a line of seismic products for oil and gas exploration activities 
dynawell s operating results from the date of acquisition are reported under a new segment that we have named oilfield products 
in  explosive metalworking accounted for of our net sales and of our income from continuing operations before consideration of stock based compensation expense  which is not allocated to our business segments 
our oilfield products and amk welding segments accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales 
in and  explosive metalworking accounted for more than and of our net sales  respectively  and and of income from continuing operations  respectively 
our net sales  which include a full year of sales from the acquired dynaenergetics businesses  increased by  or  compared to net sales  which include sales from dynaenergetics for the period from november through december  the year to year consolidated net sales increase reflects sales increases of  for our explosive metalworking segment   for our new oilfield products segment and  for amk welding 
explosive metalworking s and sales included sales contributions of  and  respectively  from dynaenergetics explosion clad business 
our income from continuing operations decreased by to  in from  in  reflecting a  decline in explosive metalworking s operating income and an increase in stock based compensation expense of  that were partially offset by improvements of  and in the operating income performance of oilfield products and amk welding  respectively 
reported consolidated operating income for and for include amortization expense of  and  respectively  relating to purchased intangible assets associated with the acquisition of dynaenergetics 
our net income decreased by to  in from  in impact of current economic situation on the company 
the company was only minimally impacted in by the global economic slow down 
during the fourth quarter of  our sales decreased slightly from historic levels 
we expect our net consolidated sales in to decrease approximately to from the amount we achieved in in light of this expected slow down  we have deferred some of our previous planned capital expenditures and are continuing to carefully manage expenses 
we expect continued strong  although somewhat reduced  cash flow from operations for as of december   we had over million in cash and cash equivalents as well as approximately million of borrowing capacity available under our current credit facilities 
net sales explosive metalworking s revenues are generated principally from sales of clad metal plates and sales of transition joints  which are made from clad plates  to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various industries  including oil and gas  petrochemicals  alternative energy  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  industrial refrigeration  and similar industries 
while a large portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by new plant construction and large plant expansion projects  maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing  petrochemical processing  oil refining  and aluminum smelting facilities also account for a significant portion of total demand 
oilfield products revenues are generated principally from sales of shaped charges  detonators and detonating cord  and bidirectional booster sand perforating guns to customers who perform the perforation of oil and gas wells and from sales of seismic products to customers involved in oil and gas exploration activities 
amk welding s revenues are generated from welding  heat treatment  and inspection services that are provided with respect to customer supplied parts for customers primarily involved in the power generation industry and aircraft engine markets 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis  to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
we attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price 
gross profit and cost of products sold cost of products sold for explosive metalworking includes the cost of metals and alloys used to manufacture clad metal plates  the cost of explosives  employee compensation and benefits  freight  outside processing costs  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
cost of products sold for oilfield products includes the cost of metals  explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture shaped charges  detonating products and perforating guns as well as employee compensation and benefits  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
amk welding s cost of products sold consists principally of employee compensation and benefits  welding supplies wire and gas  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  outside services and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
discontinued operations on january   we sold our option rights to purchase the real estate previously used in a discontinued operation to the property owner for  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately  on this transaction  which was reported as discontinued operations  net of related taxes  in the first quarter of in december  we sold remaining equipment of those discontinued operations to the company who had previously been leasing that equipment from us 
the sale of this equipment resulted in an additional pre tax gain on discontinued operations of we reported net of tax income of  for the full year as a result of these two transactions 
income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to in from in income tax provisions on the earnings of nobelclad  nitro metall  dynaenergetics and our german and luxembourg holding companies have been provided based upon the respective french  swedish  german and luxembourg statutory tax rates for the applicable years 
going forward  based upon existing tax regulations and current federal  state and foreign statutory tax rates  we expect our effective tax rate on our projected consolidated pre tax income to range between and backlog we use backlog as a primary means of measuring the immediate outlook for our business 
we define backlog at any given point in time as consisting of all firm  unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time 
generally speaking  we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following months 
from experience  most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized 
our backlog with respect to the explosive metalworking segment decreased to  at december   from  at december  despite only a small decrease in explosive metalworking backlog from december  to december   we are forecasting that our consolidated net sales for fiscal will decline between and from those reported in fiscal this anticipated sales decline is attributable to uncertainty associated with current global economic conditions  the slowdown we have already seen in the chemical  petrochemical and hydrometallurgy sectors  and the difficulty in predicting the timing of large orders 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales change percentage change net sales net sales for increased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the year to year increase in worldwide explosive metalworking sales is principally attributable to incremental sales from dynaplat who contributed  to sales as compared to  for the period from november through december  sales from our legacy explosive metalworking businesses increased by to  in from  in  with this lower than expected increase reflecting slowing growth rates in several of the industries that this business segment serves 
oilfield products contributed  to sales in of total sales compared to  in of total sales  with sales reflecting sales for the november through december  time period 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
the increase in amk welding s sales reflects an increase of more than in ground based gas turbine sales

oilfield products reported a gross margin of on sales of  as compared to a gross margin of on its sales of  since sales covered only the period from november through december   the gross margin reported by oilfield products in is considered more indicative of the going forward gross margin rate for this business 
the decreased year to date gross profit margin rates for explosive metalworking relates primarily to a higher proportion of sales by our european divisions in than in as a result of the dynaenergetics acquisition 
as mentioned above  dynaplat contributed  and  to and sales  respectively 
historically  gross margins for our european explosion welding divisions  including those of the dynaplat division  have generally been lower than those reported by our us division 
sales by our european divisions in and represented and  respectively  of total explosive metalworking sales 
during the gross margins that we reported in our quarterly financial statements ranged from a low of in the fourth quarter to a high of in the third quarter 
we expect to see continued fluctuations in our quarterly gross margin rates during that result from anticipated fluctuations in quarterly sales volume and changes in product mix 
due to an expected decline in sales and resultant less favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses  we currently expect quarterly gross margins for explosive metalworking to be in a range of to

in connection with acquisition of dynaenergetics  we borrowed approximately  under our new  five year credit facility  assumed approximately  of dynaenergetics debt outstanding as of the acquisition date  and used approximately  of our existing cash balances to finance the acquisition 
as a result of this new indebtedness and a decrease in our cash position  we reported a significant amount of interest expense during the last six weeks of and throughout income tax provision change percentage change income tax provision effective tax rate we recorded an income tax provision of  in compared to  in the effective tax rate decreased to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes associated with the operations of nobelclad and its swedish subsidiary  nitro metall  as well as the newly acquired dynaenergetics operations 
the effective tax rate of represents a significant deviation from the expected full year effective tax rate of to that was disclosed at the end of the second quarter 
the deviation arose primarily from the completion during the third quarter of an internal revenue service examination and from adjustments that were identified during the third quarter preparation and filing of our federal and state tax returns 
the closure of the internal revenue service examination enabled the company to record previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately net 
the book to return adjustments favorably impacted the third quarter tax provision by approximately  and related primarily to apportionment factors utilized to compute state income taxes 
largely as a result of these third quarter tax provision adjustments  our full year blended effective tax rate was reduced to 
our blended effective tax rate for is expected to increase to a range from to based on projected pre tax income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales change percentage change net sales net sales for increased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the year to year increase in worldwide explosive metalworking sales was principally attributable to the improved economic condition of the industries that this business segment serves and also reflected sales of  for the period november through december  from the acquisition of dynaenergetics 
oilfield products contributed  to sales of total sales for the november through december  time period 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
the increase in amk welding s sales relates principally to increased revenues from h system ground based gas turbine work

the increase in fixed manufacturing overhead expenses at amk welding was attributable to the recently completed facility expansion and staffing additions as amk readies itself for anticipated increases in production levels during oilfield products reported a gross margin of on its sales of  which is considered to be within the range of normal for this business 
the decreased year to date gross margin rate for explosive metalworking relates primarily to changes in product mix during as compared to that for during  the gross margins that we reported in our quarterly financial statements ranged from a low of in the fourth quarter to a high of in the second quarter 
gross margins for our european operations  including those of the dynaplat division of dynaenergetics  were generally lower than those reported by our us operation 
inclusion of dynaplat s sales and cost of products sold for the period from november through december  lowered explosive metalworking gross margins 
during  the gross margins that we reported in our quarterly financial statements ranged from a low of in the third quarter to a high of in the fourth quarter 
the high fourth quarter gross margin reflects the impact of favorable margin levels on an  contract that shipped during the quarter  which involved complex materials engineering and a tight delivery schedule

income from discontinued operations change percentage change income from discontinued operations   na we completed the divestiture of our spin forge division in september under the principal divestiture agreement  we sold the assets of the spin forge division to a third party  excluding certain equipment and real estate which were leased or subleased to the buyer 
we held a purchase option on the spin forge real estate that allowed us to purchase the real estate for  a price that was below the real estate s appraised value 
we completed the sale of the purchase option on the spin forge real estate on january  the option rights were sold to the property owner for  on january  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately  on this transaction  which was reported in discontinued operations  net of related taxes 
in december  the third party purchaser of the spin forge business purchased the majority of the leased equipment while the remainder of the leased assets was liquidated by the company 
these transactions resulted in a pre tax gain of  which was recorded in discontinued operations  net of related taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations from a combination of internally generated cash flow  revolving credit borrowings  various long term debt arrangements  and the issuance of common stock 
prior to the november  acquisition of dynaenergetics  we had no outstanding borrowings under our  revolving credit facility with a us bank although we did have term debt outstanding of euros approximately under a term loan with a french bank 
in connection with the acquisition of dynaenergetics  we terminated our  revolving credit facility and entered into a five year syndicated credit agreement 
the credit agreement  which provides for term loans of  and  euros and revolving loans of  and  euros  is through a syndicate of seven banks 
the credit facility in the approximate amount of  expires on november  as of the acquisition closing date and as of december   term loans of  and  euros were outstanding under the new credit facility 
additionally  we assumed outstanding debt obligations of dynaenergetics  including lines of credit loans and term loans in the amounts of  and  respectively  as of december  as of december   term loans of  and  euros  were outstanding under the credit facility and  was outstanding under term loan obligations of dynaenergetics 
there were no outstanding borrowings under revolving credit or line of credit agreements as of december  we have approximately  available for borrowing under these facilities 
we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital  debt service  and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future 
nevertheless  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies 
if we are unable to i realize sales from our backlog  ii secure new customer orders at attractive prices  and iii continue to implement cost effective internal processes  our ability to meet cash requirements through operating activities could be impacted 
furthermore  any restriction on the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements 
debt and other contractual obligations and commitments our existing loan agreements include various covenants and restrictions  certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders  redemption of capital stock  incurrence of additional indebtedness  mortgaging  pledging or disposition of major assets  and maintenance of specified financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of our debt agreements

critical accounting policies our historical consolidated financial statements and notes to our historical consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us 
in management s opinion  the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are revenue recognition  asset impairments  inventory valuation and impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  and actual results could differ from the estimates  as additional information becomes known 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales of clad metal products and welding services are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used  services performed and the results of any non destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed 
all issues of conformity of the product to specifications are resolved before the product is shipped and billed 
products related to the oilfield products segment  which include detonating cords  detonators  bi directional boosters and shaped charges  as well as  seismic related explosives and accessories  are standard in nature 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
for contracts that require multiple shipments  revenue is recorded only for the units included in each individual shipment 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a probable loss  the company will account for such anticipated loss 
asset impairments we review our long lived assets to be held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in so doing  we estimate the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
long lived assets to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
business combinations we accounted for our business acquisition in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated the total cost of the acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  we identified and attributed values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involved significant estimates and assumptions regarding multiple  highly subjective variables  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates  asset lives  and the use of different valuation models and therefore required considerable judgment 
our estimates and assumptions were based  in part  on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data 
these determinations affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
we based our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment because it is not amortized 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances  many of which are subjective in nature  include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy  a significant decrease in the market value of the asset  and a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset 
we assess impairment by comparing the fair value of an identifiable intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment as described further below 
impairments are expensed when incurred 
specifically  we test for impairment as follows goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we test goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level as defined by reference to sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  on at least an annual basis 
a reporting unit is a group of businesses i for which discrete financial information is available and ii that have similar economic characteristics 
we test goodwill for impairment using the following two step approach the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  including market information and discounted cash flow projections  also referred to as the income approach 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the projections incorporate our best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist  and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in the second step  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had just been acquired in a business combination and as if the purchase price was equivalent to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill 
we then compare that implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss for the excess 
our impairment testing has not resulted in a determination that any of our goodwill is impaired  however  the passing margin of the first step of our goodwill impairment testing relative to the oilfield products business segment as of december  was minimal estimated fair value was less than greater than the carrying value 
future impairment is possible and will occur if i the unit s operating results underperform what we have estimated or ii additional volatility of the capital markets cause us to raise the percent discount rate utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis or decrease the multiples utilized in our market based analysis 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our reporting units or using methodologies other than as described above could result in different values for reporting units and could result in an impairment charge 
intangible assets subject to amortization an intangible asset that is subject to amortization is reviewed when impairment indicators are present in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we compare the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows associated with finite lived assets to their respective carrying values to determine if the asset is fully recoverable 
if the expected future operating cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  we estimate the fair value of the asset 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and when the carrying value exceeds fair value 
the projected cash flows require several assumptions related to  among other things  relevant market factors  revenue growth  if any  and operating margins 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks the functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency for each affiliate company 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated at exchange rates in effect at period end  and the statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments
