item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and our selected historical financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we produce  process and sell steam and metallurgical met coal from eight regional business units  which  as of december   were supported by active underground mines  active surface mines and preparation plants located throughout virginia  west virginia  kentucky  and pennsylvania  as well as a road construction business in west virginia and virginia that recovers coal 
we also sell coal produced by others  the majority of which we process and or blend with coal produced from our mines prior to resale  providing us with a higher overall margin for the blended product than if we had sold the coals separately 
our sales of steam coal in and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume  and our sales of metallurgical coal in and  which generally sells at a premium over steam coal  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume 
our sales of steam coal during and were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers in the eastern region of the united states  and our sales of met coal during those years were made primarily to steel companies in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the united states and in several countries in europe  asia and south america 
approximately of our total revenue in and of our sales revenue in was derived from sales made outside the united states  primarily in brazil  egypt  turkey  russia and canada 
in addition  we generate other revenues from equipment and parts sales  equipment repair  road construction  rentals  royalties  commissions  coal handling  terminal and processing fees  and coal and environmental analysis fees 
we also record revenue for freight and handling charges incurred in delivering coal to our customers  which we treat as being reimbursed by our customers 
however  these freight and handling revenues are offset by equivalent freight and handling costs and do not contribute to our profitability 
our primary expenses are for wages and benefits  supply costs  repair and maintenance expenditures  cost of purchased coal  royalties  freight and handling costs  and taxes incurred in selling our coal 
historically  our cost of coal sales per ton is lower for sales of our produced and processed coal than for sales of purchased coal that we do not process prior to resale 
we have one reportable segment  coal operations  which includes all of our revenues and costs from coal production and sales  freight and handling  rentals  commissions  coal handling and processing operations and coal recovery incidental to our road construction operations 
these revenues and costs included in our coal operations segment are reported by us in our coal revenues and cost of coal sales  except for the revenues and costs from rentals  commissions  road construction  and coal handling and processing operations  which we report in our other revenues and cost of other revenues  respectively 
business developments excelven pty ltd 
in december  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the total remaining value of our interest in excelven pty ltd 
excelven because we have exhausted all reasonable efforts to obtain a mining permit from the venezuelan government and concluded that it is no longer reasonable to assume that a permit will be granted 
excelven  through its subsidiaries  controls the rights to the las carmelitas mining venture in venezuela 
kingwood mining company  llc 
on december   we announced the permanent closure of the whitetail kittanning mine  an adjacent coal preparation plant and other ancillary facilities 
the mine stopped producing coal in early january and kingwood will cease equipment recovery operations by the end of april the decision resulted from adverse geologic conditions and regulatory requirements that rendered the coal seam unmineable at this location 
we recorded a charge of million  which includes asset impairment charges of million  write off of advance mining royalties of million  which will not be recoverable  severance and other employee benefit costs of million and increased reclamation obligations of million 
beginning with the first quarter of when the mining operations at kingwood cease  we will report the kingwood s results of operations as a discontinued operation 
cliffs natural resources  inc proposed merger 
on july   we entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which  and subject to the terms and conditions thereof  cliffs would acquire all of our outstanding shares

common stock and convertible debt offering 
on april   we completed concurrent public offerings of  shares of common stock at per share and million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the convertible notes 
the aggregate net proceeds from the common stock offering and the notes offering were million after commissions and expenses 
we used the net proceeds from the offerings in part to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due  co issued by anr llc and alpha natural resources capital corp 
as a result  in the second quarter of  we recorded a loss relating to the early extinguishment of debt of million  consisting of million in tender offer consideration and million in write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs 
on july   the convertible notes became convertible at the option of the holders and remained convertible through september  the notes were convertible because our common stock exceeded the conversion threshold price of per share of the applicable conversion price of per share for at least twenty trading days within the thirty consecutive trading days ending june  as a result of the notes becoming convertible  in the second quarter of  we fully amortized the deferred debt issuance costs in the amount of million incurred with the issuance of the convertible notes 
because the notes are not currently convertible  the notes are classified as long term 
coal pricing trends  uncertainties and outlook the global financial crisis and economic slowdown have precipitated deep cuts in the worldwide steel production  which caused met coal prices to decrease in the fourth quarter of after the coal market experienced record increases in prices during the second and third quarters of given the duress thatmost sectors of the global economy are suffering  and the impact on energy demand  our immediate priorities entering are to maintain margins  preserve cash flows and our sound financial position  and monitor the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers 
although steel production worldwide decreased in the final quarter of  we believe that coke batteries that use metallurgical coals are  in general  operating at higher capacity levels than steel blast furnaces 
some indicators in the steel sector have turned favorable in the first weeks of for example  steel service center inventories in the us dropped from august to the end of and stood at year lows entering  which should help hasten the return of idle blast furnace capacity as service centers begin to rebuild depleted inventories 
however  with end demand for steel products continuing to be hampered by the global recession  a great deal of uncertainty remains 
of particular importance for our remaining planned metallurgical coal production are the upcoming negotiations for international met coal contracts 
currently we do not have any precise indication where prices will settle out for the various coking coal qualities as a result of these negotiations 
because of the marked change in market dynamics  certain agreements with our steel customers that were entered into late in were restructured recently under mutually acceptable terms 
as of mid january  our total committed book of metallurgical coal stood at million tons  at an average realization of in addition  we begin with nearly million tons  or  of planned thermal coal production committed and priced for at an average realization per ton approximately higher than the average of for at the end of december  we made several adjustments to our mine production plans in response to weakened market conditions 
we also plan to reduce outside coal purchases and coal produced by third party contractors  and defer small expansion projects at several mines 
we are exposed to market price risk in the normal course of purchasing and selling coal and in the price paid for diesel fuel 
as of december   we had net unrealized losses on diesel fuel swap and put agreements and forward purchase coal contracts of million and million  respectively  and net unrealized gains on diesel fuel put options and forward sale coal contracts of million and million  respectively  all of which met the definition of a derivative under sfas and are marked to market 
the million liability for diesel fuel swaps and put agreements consists of million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and million in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
the million liability for the forward purchase coal contracts is in accrued expense and other current liabilities 
the asset of diesel fuel put options and forward sale coal contracts of million and million  respectively  are recorded in prepaid expense and other current assets 
periodic changes in fair value for these derivative instruments are recorded to the income statement 
due to market price fluctuations  we could experience significant earnings volatility related to coal contracts  diesel fuel swap agreements  and diesel fuel put options that are classified as derivatives 
although we experienced higher mine supply costs in  especially increases in the cost of diesel fuel and surcharges on steel for mine roof support  costs began to decline sharply for some major supply categories late in that year

since our formation and through the third quarter of  for purposes of evaluating the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  we did not weigh significantly our forecast of future taxable income subjective evidence as we had not yet established an adequate earnings history defined by us as at least three years to provide objective evidence of the ability to generate future income 
accordingly  we had recorded a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had a three year history of cumulative earnings 
as a result  we were able to place a higher degree of reliance on our projections of future taxable income 
based on the results of a comprehensive analysis completed in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset previously reserved through a valuation allowance will be realized 
as a result  we recorded a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of million 
excluding this reversal of the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate would have been approximately for discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations of million consist of losses from the operation of gallatin of million  net of minority interest and an income tax expense of million 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital resource requirements are to finance the cost of our coal production and purchases  make capital expenditures  pay income taxes  and service our debt and reclamation obligations 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from sales of our produced and purchased coal  other revenue and borrowings under our credit facility 
on april   we completed concurrent offerings of million shares of common stock and million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
the aggregate net proceeds from the common stock offering and the notes offering were million after commissions and expenses 
we used the net proceeds in part to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in addition  we amended our credit facility on march  to increase the amount available under the revolving line of credit from million to million 
at december   we had available liquidity of million subject to limitations described in our credit facility  including cash of million and million available under our credit facility 
our total indebtedness was million at december   an increase of million from december  the increase in the indebtedness is primarily due to the offering of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes  as described above  offset by the repurchase of the million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due and the repayment of our gallatin loan facility of million 
our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  and we expect to invest between million and million in cash capital expenditures in based on the terms of our outstanding insurance premium note payable  capital lease obligations  and indebtedness as of december   projected payments of principal on capital lease obligations and indebtedness are million in the aggregate  of which million  million  million and million are due in each of the four quarters of  respectively 
based on our projection of cash to be generated from operations in and projected availability under our revolving line of credit  we believe that cash from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures and debt repayment requirements during each quarter of the global financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices and severely diminished liquidity and credit availability 
we do not believe we experienced any significant impact on our liquidity as a result of these conditions during  although the market price for our common shares has declined substantially 
we continue to monitor these developments and the resulting impact on our business and our suppliers and customers closely 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in the financial markets  and a continuation or worsening of the market disruption and economic downturn could impair our ability to access the capital or credit markets or otherwise obtain financing

the increase in our net income was mainly due to an increase in our coal margin per ton of and a million  after tax  merger termination fee received from cliffs 
the increase in non cash charges and credits was mainly driven by a million increase in the change in the fair value of derivative instruments from to  and million related to mine closure and asset impairment charges 
net cash used in operating activities from our discontinued operations during and was million and million  respectively  which is included within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
in connection with the termination of the proposed merger with cliffs in november  cliffs paid us a fee of million 
net of fees paid to our financial advisor  legal and other professional fees and expenses  the gain recognized on the termination fee of the cliffs proposed merger was approximately million 
this  in accordance with current accounting principles  is included in our cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  we have not received any similar fees in recent prior years and do not anticipate receiving similar fees in the future 
net cash used in investing activities  including discontinued operations  during was million  a decrease of million from the million of net cash used in investing activities during the decrease was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of gallatin in the amount of million and a million increase in proceeds from the disposal of property  plant  equipment and investments over the prior year  primarily resulting from the kentucky may sale  partially offset by increased capital expenditures of million and a decrease in cash used to acquire mingo logan in of million 
cash used in investing activities from our discontinued operations during and was million and million  respectively  which was primarily used for capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities  including discontinued operations  during was million  an increase of million from the million of net cash used in financing activities during the increase was primarily due to the concurrent offerings of our common stock and our convertible notes  which generated net proceeds of million after commissions and expenses  of which a portion was used to repurchase the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due net cash used in provided by financing activities from our discontinued operations during the year ended december  and were million  which includes the million for the repayment of our gallatin loan facility  and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  an increase of million from million in excluding the non cash deferred income tax benefit of million in  the increase in was due to an increase in non cash items of million and an increase in cash provided from operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by a decrease in net income of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  an increase of million from the million in the increase in was primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs  mostly offset by decreases in capital expenditures and disposals of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  a decrease of million from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bank overdraft and lower payments on notes payable than credit facility and long term debt as of december   our total long term indebtedness  including capital lease obligations  consisted of the following in thousands december  term loan convertible senior notes due insurance premium financing capital lease obligation total long term debt less current portion long term debt net of current portion our senior secured credit facility  entered into in october  originally consisted of a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
the term loan will mature in october  and the revolving credit facility will terminate in october on march   alpha natural resources  inc the parent and alpha natural resources  llc anr llc entered into an amendment to the related credit agreement to increase the amount available under the revolving credit portion of the facility from million to million 
as of december   there was million available under the revolving credit facility 
on march   the parent and anr llc entered into another amendment to the credit agreement to  among other things  delete the covenant that restricted the parent from engaging in any business or activity other than certain specified activities  remove the parent from the application of all of the other negative covenants in the credit facility and to impose on the parent certain other restrictive covenants in lieu of the original negative covenants 
on october   the parent and anr llc entered into a further amendment to the credit agreement 
this amendment included certain technical amendments to permit anr llc and certain of its affiliates to enter into a permitted receivables financing  as well as an increase in the limit on annual capital expenditures from million to million 

table of contents as amended  the credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on anr llc and its restricted subsidiaries  including  subject to certain exceptions  restrictions on their ability to incur debt  grant liens  enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses  provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person  make loans  investments  advances and acquisitions  sell assets  pay dividends or make distributions  make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock  make capital expenditures  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  liquidate or dissolve  engage in mergers or consolidations  engage in affiliate transactions  change businesses  change fiscal year  amend certain debt and other material agreements  issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  and restrict distributions from subsidiaries 
the credit agreement also requires anr llc to satisfy two financial performance covenants a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio  as described below 
the restrictions imposed on the parent include restrictive covenants that prohibit the parent from i changing its fiscal year  ii acquiring capital stock in any other person other than anr llc or granting liens on the capital stock of anr llc  iii acquiring any division of or assets constituting a line of business of any other person or engaging in any line of business and iv incurring any debt  except that the parent may incur debt as long as anr llc would be in pro forma compliance with the credit agreement s maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio financial performance covenants  which are calculated based on our consolidated financial results 
it also provides that any of the parent s debt that would have been permitted under the credit agreement had it been incurred by anr llc will reduce on a dollar for dollar basis the amount of debt that anr llc would otherwise be permitted to incur under the credit agreement 
the march  amendment to the credit agreement provided a new exception to the covenant restricting dividends to permit anr llc to pay dividends or make distributions to the parent i to make scheduled payments of interest and fees and expenses then due on our convertible notes or then due in respect of any qualified debt which means any debt  other than the convertible notes  that could have been incurred instead by anr llc in compliance with the credit agreement  ii to make payments of principal or premium then due in respect of any qualified debt as long as such payments would be permitted under the credit agreement at that time if anr llc or a restricted subsidiary  rather than the parent  were the obligor of such qualified debt and were making such payments  iii to make payments of principal or premium on the convertible notes not to exceed million in the aggregate for the term of the credit agreement that become due solely as a result of the conversion of convertible notes and not as a result of any reason other than conversion  such as mandatory repurchases of convertible notes in connection with the occurrence of certain events  and iv so long as immediately before and after such dividends or distributions are paid anr llc is in pro forma compliance with the credit agreement s maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio financial performance covenants  and a new maximum senior secured leverage ratio test  all as described below  the liquidity test described below is satisfied and no event of default under the credit agreement has occurred and is continuing  to make payments of principal or premium on the convertible notes in excess of million that become due solely as a result of the conversion of convertible notes and not as a result of any reason other than conversion  such as mandatory repurchases of convertible notes in connection with the occurrence of certain events 
the amendment also i revised the covenant restricting the lines of business in which the parent and its subsidiaries may engage to clarify that any businesses or activities that are within the mining and or energy industries generally are permitted lines of business as long as the core business remains coal mining and ii creates a new exception to the lien covenant to permit the granting of liens on the capital stock of the anr llc s unrestricted subsidiaries to secure debt of those subsidiaries 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to mandatory prepayment with of the net cash proceeds received from asset sales or other dispositions of property by anr llc and its subsidiaries including insurance and other condemnation proceedings  subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment provisions  and with of the net cash proceeds received by anr llc and its subsidiaries from the issuance of debt securities or other incurrence of debt  excluding certain indebtedness 
analysis of material debt covenants we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility as of december  the financial covenants in our credit facility require  among other things we must maintain a maximum leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of consolidated debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement  adjusted ebitda  of not more than for the period of four fiscal quarters ended on december  and for each period of four fiscal quarters ending on each quarter end thereafter 
we must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of adjusted ebitda to cash interest expense  of not less than for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter 
a breach of the covenants in the credit facility  including these financial covenants that are tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda  could result in a default under the credit facility and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any acceleration under our credit facility would also result in a default under the indenture governing our convertible notes 
in order for anr llc to be permitted to pay dividends or make distributions to the parent to make payments of principal or premium on the convertible notes in excess of million that become due solely as a result of the conversion of convertible notes  we must be able to satisfy the following two financial performance tests both immediately before and immediately after giving effect to the payment of any such dividend or distribution  in addition to being in compliance with the maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios described above we must have a maximum senior secured leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of consolidated debt that is secured by a lien less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to adjusted ebitda  of or starting january  we must satisfy a liquidity test  ie  the sum of the unused commitments under the credit facility s revolving line of credit plus our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents must not be less than million 

table of contents at december   our leverage ratio was less than zero  therefore it is not meaningful  and our interest coverage ratio was  and the sum of the unused commitments under the credit facility s revolving line of credit plus our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents was million 
the senior secured leverage ratio was  due to our cash and cash equivalent balance exceeding our term loan amount 
if certain circumstances exist as described in the supplemental indenture where all of our million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes were converted at the option of the holders  we would have adequate liquidity to satisfy the obligations under the notes and remain in compliance with any required covenants 
adjusted ebitda is used in our credit agreement to determine compliance with many of the covenants under the facility 
adjusted ebitda is defined in our credit agreement as ebitda  further adjusted to exclude non recurring items  non cash items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our credit facility  as shown in the table below 
we believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financial covenants 
three months ended march  three months ended june  three months ended september  three months ended december  twelve months ended december  in thousands net income interest expense  net interest income income tax expense depreciation  depletion  and amortization ebitda unrestricted subsidiary change in fair value of derivative instruments write off of assets other allowance adjustments accretion expense amortization of deferred gains loss on early extinguishment of debt stock based compensation charges adjusted ebitda leverage ratio nm interest coverage ratio leverage ratio is defined in our credit facility as total debt divided by adjusted ebitda 
interest coverage ratio is defined in our credit facility as adjusted ebitda divided by cash interest expense 

table of contents other as a regular part of our business  we review opportunities for  and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning  the acquisition of coal mining assets and interests in coal mining companies and related businesses  and acquisitions of  or combinations with  coal mining companies and related businesses 
when we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our growth plans and our acquisition criteria  we will make bids or proposals and or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements  which may be binding or nonbinding  that are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if  among other things  we are not satisfied with the results of our due diligence investigation 
any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of december  in thousands after total long term debt and capital leases equipment purchase commitments operating leases minimum royalties coal purchase commitments coal contract buyout total long term debt and capital leases include principal amounts due in the years shown 
cash interest payable on these obligations  with interest rates ranging between and on our loans and capital leases  would be approximately million in  million in to  million in to  and million after additionally  we have long term liabilities relating to asset retirement obligations  workers compensation and black lung benefits and postretirement benefits 
the table below reflects the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these obligations in thousands after total asset retirement obligation postretirement workers compensation benefits and black lung benefits total 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
from time to time  we provide guarantees to financial institutions to facilitate the acquisition of mining equipment by third parties who mine coal for us 
this arrangement is beneficial to us because it helps insure a continuing source of coal production 
federal and state laws require us to secure payment of certain long term obligations such as mine closure and reclamation costs  federal and state workers compensation  coal leases and other obligations 
we typically secure these payment obligations by using surety bonds  an off balance sheet instrument 
the use of surety bonds is less expensive for us than the alternative of posting a cash bond or a bank letter of credit  either of which would require a greater use of our credit facility 
in addition  due to the current instability and volatility of the financial markets  our current surety bond providers may experience difficulties in providing new surety bonds to us  maintaining existing surety bonds  or satisfying liquidity requirements under existing surety bond contracts 
in that event  we would be required to find alternative sources of funding to satisfy our payment obligations  which may require greater use of our credit facility 
to the extent that surety bonds may become unavailable  we would seek to secure our reclamation obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral 
as of december   we have a committed bonding facility with travelers casualty and surety company of america  pursuant to which travelers has agreed  subject to certain conditions  to issue surety bonds on our behalf in a maximum amount of million 
we also have a committed bonding facility with the chubb group of insurance companies  pursuant to which chubb has agreed  subject to certain conditions  to issue surety bonds on our behalf in a maximum amount of million 
we further have a facility with safeco insurance company of america pursuant to which they have agreed  subject to certain conditions  to issue surety bonds on our behalf in a maximum amount of million 
as of december   we have posted an aggregate of million in reclamation bonds and million of other types of bonds under these facilities and maintained letters of credit totaling million to secure reclamation and other surety bond obligations 
as part of the sale of gallatin on september   an escrow balance of million was established and we have agreed to indemnify and guarantee the buyer against breaches of representations and warranties in the sale agreement as well as contingencies that may have existed at closing and materialize within one year from the date of sale 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions  including the current economic environment that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we adjust such estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances require 
illiquid credit markets  volatile equity  foreign currency  and energy markets and declines with the end demand for steel products due to the current economic environment have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods 
reclamation 
our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  and sealing portals at deep mines 
we account for the costs of our reclamation activities in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
we determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage  cost estimates  and assumptions regarding productivity 
estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data 
cost estimates are based upon third party costs 
productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  our asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value  or the amount at which obligations could be settled in a current transaction between willing third parties 
in order to determine fair value  we must also estimate a discount rate and third party margin 
each is discussed further below discount rate 
sfas requires that asset retirement obligations be initially recorded at fair value 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations 
we base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives  adjusted for our credit standing 
third party margin 
sfas requires the measurement of an obligation to be based upon the amount a third party would demand to assume the obligation 
because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources  a third party margin was added to the estimated costs of these activities 
this margin was estimated based upon our historical experience with contractors performing similar types of reclamation activities 
the inclusion of this margin will result in a recorded obligation that is greater than our estimates of our cost to perform the reclamation activities 
if our cost estimates are accurate  the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded as a gain at the time that reclamation work is completed 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  as of december   we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closures is approximately million 

table of contents coal reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of economically recoverable coal reserves  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists and reviewed by a third party consultant 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
variances could affect our projected future revenues and expenditures  as well as the valuation of coal reserves and depletion rates 
at december   we had million tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
postretirement medical benefits 
we have long term liabilities for postretirement benefit cost obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded 
the liability is actuarially determined  and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefit costs 
the discount rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement benefits other than pensions was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  at december   we had postretirement medical benefit obligations of million 
health care cost trend rate one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on a accumulated postretirement benefit obligation discount rate one half percentage point increase one half percentage point decrease in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on a accumulated postretirement benefit obligation workers compensation 
workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain personal injuries due to job related accidents are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer fatal injuries receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee who is injured in the course of employment 
our operations are covered through a combination of a self insurance program and an insurance policy 
we accrue for any self insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarial studies 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
at december   we had workers compensation obligations of million 

table of contents coal workers pneumoconiosis 
we are required by federal and state statutes to provide benefits to employees for awards related to coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
these claims are covered by a third party insurance provider in all locations where we operate with the exception of west virginia 
the company is self insured for state black lung related claims at certain locations in west virginia 
we account for self insured black lung obligations under the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefit other than pension sfas  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
charges are made to operations for state black lung claims in west virginia  as determined by an independent actuary at the present value of the actuarially computed liability for such benefits over the employee s applicable term of service 
as of december   we had black lung obligations of million 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we analyze both positive and negative evidence as required by sfas such evidence includes objective evidence obtained from our historical earnings  future sales commitments  outlooks on the coal industry by us and third parties  expected level of future earnings with sensitivities on expectations considered  timing of temporary difference reversals  ability or inability to meet forecasted earnings  unsettled industry circumstances  ability to carry back and utilize a future tax loss if a loss were to occur  available tax planning strategies  limitations on deductibility of temporary differences  and the impact the alternative minimum tax has on utilization of deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is monitored and reviewed quarterly 
if our conclusions change in the future regarding the realization of a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the determination is made  which may have a material impact on our results 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million less a valuation allowance of million 
new accounting pronouncements issued and not yet adopted in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp accounting principles board apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb  which applies to convertible debt instruments that  by their stated terms  may be settled in cash or other assets upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  unless the embedded conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under sfas fsp apb requires issuers of such instruments to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted and retroactive application to all periods presented is required 
upon adoption of fsp apb  on january   we will retrospectively apply the change in accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if the principle has always been used 
the adoption of fsp apb will result in an estimated pre tax increase to non cash interest expense in future annual periods of approximately million 
upon retrospective application in  the adoption will also result in pretax decrease of non cash interest expense of million  which is comprised of the reversal of million of previously written off deferred loan costs net of million of additional interest expense for the accretion of the liability component of the debt and million of deferred loan cost amortization 
adoption of the standard will also result in the following pre tax balance sheet impacts at december   a reduction of debt by approximately million and an increase in paid in capital by million and an increase to deferred loan costs by approximately million  an increase to paid in capital by million with a pre tax credit of million to the income statement to record deferred loan costs previously written off when the notes became convertible and to allocate those costs between the portion related to the debt and equity components 
we are continuing to analyze the tax impacts of adopting the new standard  but currently expect that adoption will also result in an increase to deferred tax liabilities and a decrease to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets with the offsetting impact of these entries being recorded to paid in capital 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which amends sfas sfas is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the new standard also improves transparency about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in an entity s financial statements  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
since sfas requires only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging activities  adoption of sfas will not affect our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations sfas r  and sfas no 
 accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas r and sfas will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas r retains the underlying concepts of sfas no 
 business combinations  in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but sfas r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  until either abandoned or completed  at which point the useful lives will be determined  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests  and classified as a component of equity 
these pronouncements will become effective january  upon adoption  sfas r will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  however  any business combination we enter into after the adoption may significantly impact our financial position and results of operations when compared to acquisitions accounted for under existing us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and result in more earnings volatility and generally lower earnings due to the expensing of deal costs and restructuring costs of acquired companies 
upon adoption  sfas will not impact our consolidated financial statements until  if or when we effectuate a business combination post adoption that has noncontrolling minority interests 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to risks inherent in operations  we are exposed to market risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to the risks of changing coal and diesel fuel prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk we are exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling coal 
at january   of our planned production was committed and priced and approximately was committed and unpriced  with approximately million tons uncommitted 
the uncommitted or unpriced tons are subject to future market price volatility 
at january   we had entered into commitments to purchase million tons of coal from others during we use significant quantities of diesel fuel in our operations and are also exposed to risk in the market price for diesel fuel 
we have entered into swap agreements and diesel fuel put options to reduce the volatility in the price of diesel fuel for our operations 
the diesel fuel swap agreements and put options have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes  accordingly  the changes in the fair value for these derivative contracts are required to be recorded in cost of sales 
as a result  changes in the market price of diesel fuel can have a material impact on our earnings 
these diesel fuel swaps and put options use the nymex new york harbor no 
heating oil no 
heating oil futures contract as the underlying commodity reference price 
as of december   we had in place swap agreements with respect to million gallons of diesel fuel  at fixed prices ranging from to per gallon  which mature in to the fair value of these diesel fuel swap agreements is a liability of million which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the amount of million and in other liabilities in the amount of million as of december  we have also employed an options strategy both purchasing and selling put options to protect cash flows in the event diesel fuel prices decline 
as of december   we had purchased put options for million gallons for the first six months of at a strike price of per gallon 
in the event that no 
heating oil prices decline below the strike price  we can exercise the put options and sell the million gallons at the strike price  therefore reducing the negative impact of any of the swap agreements that have settlement prices above market 
as of december   we had sold put options for million gallons for the first six months of at a strike price of per gallon 
this was part of a put spread strategy that effectively provided protection for market prices between and 
in the event that no 
heating oil prices decline below the strike price  then the sold put options will offset the purchased put options with no net benefit or cost 
the net fair value of all these diesel fuel put options is a net asset of million of which million is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of december  we purchase coal in the otc market and directly from third parties to supplement and blend with our produced and processed coal in order to provide coal of the quality and quantity to meet certain of our customer s requirements 
we also sell in the otc market to fix the price of uncommitted future production from our mines 
certain of these purchase and sale contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument 
any derivative instruments that we hold are held for purposes other than trading 
our risk management policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purpose 
the use of purchase and sales contracts which are considered derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations as a result of the requirement to mark them to market at the end of each reporting period 
these transactions give rise to commodity price risk  which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the price of coal 
outstanding purchase and sales contracts at december  that are considered derivative instruments are summarized as follows purchase price tons fair value in millions purchase contracts range outstanding delivery period asset liability selling price tons fair value in millions sales contracts range outstanding delivery period asset liability interest rate risk all of our borrowings under our credit facility are at a variable rate  exposing us to the effect of rising interest rates in the united states 
as of december   we had a million term loan outstanding under our credit facility with a variable interest rate based upon the month london interbank offered rate libor at december  plus an applicable margin at december  
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates  effective may  we entered into a pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap on the notional amount of million for a period of approximately six and one half years 
in effect  this swap converted the variable interest rates based on the libor to a fixed interest rate of plus the applicable margin defined in the debt agreement at december  for the remainder of our term loan 
we account for the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and accordingly changes in fair value of the swap are recorded to other comprehensive income loss 
the fair value of the swap at year end december  was a liability of million million net of tax
