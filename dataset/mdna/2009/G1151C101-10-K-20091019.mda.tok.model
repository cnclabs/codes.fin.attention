overview our results of operations are affected by economic conditions  including macroeconomic conditions  credit market conditions and levels of business confidence 
revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges 
we add value to clients and drive revenues based on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 
the global economic downturn in fiscal was widespread  leading to economic contraction in many industries and geographies where we operate 
it also impacted the needs of our clients and the revenues in our consulting and outsourcing businesses 
these changing demand patterns have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our new contract bookings and revenue growth  compared to the prior fiscal year 
revenues before reimbursements net revenues for fiscal were billion  compared with billion in fiscal  a decrease of in us dollars and flat in local currency 
net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were billion  compared with billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decrease of in us dollars and in local currency 

table of contents in our consulting business  net revenues for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal  a decrease of in us dollars and in local currency 
consulting net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were billion  compared with billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decrease of in us dollars and in local currency 
starting in january  the global economic downturn led to lower current demand for new consulting services 
many clients are focused on initiatives designed to deliver near and medium term cost savings and performance improvement 
some clients continue to exercise caution and to seek flexibility in launching new large consulting commitments and instead have shifted to a more phased approach to contracting work 
certain clients have slowed the pace of on going projects and or have deferred decisions to expand scope beyond current commitments 
in addition  we are experiencing pricing pressures from some clients and in response  where practicable  have shifted to lower cost resources at reduced price levels  particularly in our systems integration business 
in our outsourcing business  net revenues for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal  a decrease of in us dollars and an increase of in local currency 
outsourcing net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were billion  compared with billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decrease of in us dollars and an increase of in local currency 
in response to clients seeking to reduce operating costs with requests for price concessions and more favorable contract terms  we have shifted and expect to continue to shift to lower cost resources at a reduced price level 
in addition  we have experienced a lower volume of scope expansions on existing contracts 
client strategy changes and consolidations have also resulted in more contract terminations and restructuring  primarily in financial services  and to a lesser extent in communications high tech and resources 
as we are a global company  our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
during the majority of fiscal  the us dollar weakened against many currencies  resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported us dollar revenues 
however  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the us dollar began to strengthen against many currencies and this trend continued until the fourth quarter of fiscal the foreign exchange impact on our full fiscal revenue growth was approximately lower growth in us dollars  compared to our growth in local currency 
in the future  if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  our revenue growth in us dollars may be lower than our growth in local currency 
if the us dollar weakens against other currencies  our revenue growth in us dollars may be higher than our growth in local currency 
the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs 
cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client service personnel  which consists mainly of compensation  sub contractor and other personnel costs  and non payroll outsourcing costs 
cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services  the utilization of our client service personnel and the level of non payroll costs associated with the growth of new outsourcing contracts 
utilization represents the percentage of our professionals time spent on billable consulting work 
utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal was approximately  an increase from for the third quarter of fiscal  and was at the top of the range we expected 
utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal was approximately 
sales and marketing expense is driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities  the development of new service offerings and client targeting  image development and brand recognition activities 
general and administrative costs primarily include costs for non client facing personnel  information systems and office space  which we seek to manage  as a percentage of revenues  at levels consistent with or lower than levels in prior year periods 
operating expenses in fiscal also included restructuring costs of million recorded in the fourth quarter 
these costs included million related to global consolidation of our office space and 
table of contents million related to realignment of our workforce  primarily at the senior executive level  to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future 
restructuring costs are reflected in operating expenses  along with reorganization costs and benefits  which may vary substantially from year to year 
reorganization costs and benefits were immaterial in both fiscal and fiscal gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared with for fiscal gross margin for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal the increase for both periods was driven primarily by improved overall outsourcing contract profitability 
our cost management strategies include anticipating changes in demand for our services and executing cost management initiatives 
in addition to the workforce actions included in the restructuring costs  we aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs and take on going actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services  given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
based on current and projected future demand  we have reduced our headcount to approximately  as of august   compared with more than  as of august  annualized attrition  excluding involuntary terminations  for fiscal was  compared to for fiscal we evaluate voluntary attrition and have used increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand 
our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage headcount  attrition and severance costs  recover increases in compensation and or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 
sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in selling costs as a percentage of net revenues and a bad debt provision of million  or of net revenues 
this provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables  in light of the current global economic conditions  particularly from clients in high risk industries or with potential liquidity issues 
operating income for fiscal was  million  compared with  million for fiscal operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  compared with million for the fourth quarter of fiscal operating margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared with for the fourth quarter of fiscal the restructuring costs of million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal reduced operating margin by basis points for fiscal excluding the effects of the restructuring costs  operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal increased basis points compared with fiscal our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs 
due to the significant strengthening of the us dollar against many other currencies  this impact was unfavorable during fiscal most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues 
where practical  we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues  by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs 
we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues 
for more information on our hedging programs  see note derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item  financial statements 

table of contents bookings and backlog new contract bookings for fiscal were billion  with consulting bookings of billion and outsourcing bookings of billion 
new contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal were billion  with consulting bookings of billion and outsourcing bookings of billion 
we provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time 
however  new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts 
information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to  nor should it be substituted for  an analysis of our revenues over time 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings 
new contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals  extensions and changes to existing contracts 
we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years 
new contract bookings are recorded using then existing currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations 
the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice 
accordingly  we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog 
normally  if a client terminates a project  the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project  services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 
revenue recognition our contracts have different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  the terms of which frequently require accenture to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues 
we have many types of contracts  including time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types 
in addition  some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred  benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts 
we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 
we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting  which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract 
estimated revenues for applying the percentage of completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable 
this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made 
estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract  and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or 
table of contents decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities 
contract loss provisions recorded as of august   and are immaterial 
revenues from contracts for non technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in such contracts  our efforts  measured by time incurred  typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure  which is the contractual earnings pattern 
for non technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees  we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms  provided the billable amounts are not contingent  are consistent with the services delivered  and are earned 
contingent or incentive revenues relating to non technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 
outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery  often through multiple workforces in different countries 
in a number of these arrangements  we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations 
revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms  unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sab  as amended by sab revenues from time and materials or cost plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
in such contracts  our effort  measured by time incurred  represents the contractual milestones or output measure  which is the contractual earnings pattern 
revenues from unit priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output 
revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized on a straight line basis  unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients 
revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 
we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability 
circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs outputs on which we are paid  failure to deliver agreed benefits  variances from planned internal external costs to deliver our services  and other factors affecting revenues and costs 
costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set up of processes  personnel and systems  which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided 
the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services 
generally  deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment 
impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets 
amounts billable to the client for transition or set up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided 

table of contents revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element 
if the amount of non contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services  then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non contingent 
fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately 
revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand alone basis  fair value of the separate elements exists and  in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element  performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control 
while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment  generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 
revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services 
billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met 
client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 
our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter  which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays 
consequently  since our first and third quarters typically have approximately more work days than our second and fourth quarters  our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 
net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts  as well as revenues from alliance agreements  neither of which is material to us 
reimbursements include billings for travel and other out of pocket expenses and third party costs  such as the cost of hardware and software resales 
in addition  reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs  where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses 
we report revenues net of any revenue based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment 
as a global company  we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly 
factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located 
valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 
we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense 
in accordance with fin  a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs 
in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 

table of contents no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities  and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged 
in evaluating a tax position  we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences  judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable 
however  final determinations of prior year tax liabilities  either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations  could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions 
the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions 
revenues by segment operating group our five reportable operating segments in fiscal were our operating groups  which were communications high tech  financial services  products  public service and resources 
for presentation purposes  all discussions and operating group financial results relating to periods through the end of our fiscal year on august  refer to the historical stand alone public service operating group  exclusive of the payer and provider components of the health life sciences industry group  which were included in our products operating group in fiscal operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues 
in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group  we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing  which represent the services sold by our operating groups 
consulting net revenues  which include management and technology consulting and systems integration  reflect a finite  distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables 
outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing  repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition  run and or manage operations of client systems or business functions 
from time to time  our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts 
the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups 
generally  operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors  pressures and challenges 
however  the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees 
the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups 
local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently  depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

table of contents while we provide discussion about our results of operations below  we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume 
management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume 
instead  our measures of volume and price are extremely complex  as each of our services contracts is unique  reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements 
pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided  the skills required and outcome sought  as well as estimated cost  risk  contract terms and other factors
