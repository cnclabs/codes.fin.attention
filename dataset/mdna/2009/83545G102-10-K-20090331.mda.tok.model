item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our ability to resume acquisition activity in the future will depend on many factors  including the availability of financing and the existence of any contractual provisions that restrict our acquisition activity  including any restrictions under the credit facility 
the automotive retailing industry remains highly fragmented  and we believe that further consolidation may occur over the long term 
we believe that attractive acquisition opportunities continue to exist for dealership groups with the capital and experience to identify  acquire and professionally manage dealerships 
we also believe manufacturers may begin to take steps to reduce the number of dealership franchisees as a result of declines in demand and in order to operate more efficiently 
also  during  domestic manufacturers general motors gm  ford and chrysler experienced substantial declines in demand due to challenging economic conditions  including the tightening of consumer credit and declines in consumer confidence 
this has forced these domestic manufacturers to seek alternative sources of capital and or government financing to maintain sufficient liquidity in order to operate 
our business will be materially and adversely impacted if any of these manufacturers cannot remain solvent or continue to further limit their lending and financing practices 
import manufacturers have also experienced declines in demand 
although we currently believe most of the import manufacturers that we represent are sufficiently capitalized and possess sufficient liquidity in order to efficiently operate  in the event the import manufacturers are severely affected by the current economic environment  our business may also be materially and adversely impacted 
recent developments our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its audit report on our consolidated financial statements that indicated there is an uncertainty that we will remain in compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements and that this uncertainty raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the issuance of a going concern explanatory paragraph by our independent registered public accounting firm would  by itself  violate a separate covenant of our revolving credit facility and associated new and used floor plan facilities with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of commercial banks and commercial finance entities the credit facility 
however  on march   we executed an amendment to the credit facility which resulted in no default arising by virtue of the going concern explanatory paragraph through may  and  as a result  we are in compliance with the covenants in the credit facility as of the date of this filing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate an extension of the amendment beyond may  in connection with the amendment executed march   we agreed to increase the interest rates for amounts outstanding and the quarterly commitment fees payable by us on the unused portion of the credit facility 
before april   the credit facility bore interest at a specified percentage above libor according to a performance based pricing grid determined by our total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter 
the quarterly commitment fees were also determined according to a performance based pricing grid determined by our total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter 
on and after april   the credit facility will bear interest as follows above libor for amounts outstanding under the revolving credit 
table of contents sub facility as defined below under the credit facility  above libor for amounts outstanding under the new vehicle floor plan sub facility under the credit facility  and above libor for amounts outstanding under the used vehicle floor plan sub facility under the credit facility 
the quarterly commitment fee on and after april  will be on the unused portion of the revolving credit sub facility under the credit facility  on the unused portion of the new vehicle floor plan sub facility under the credit facility  on the unused portion of the used vehicle floor plan sub facility under the credit facility  and for a letter of credit fee 
there were also certain other concessions we provided to the lenders under the credit facility in connection with the amendment  which includes the following 
we agreed to limit our use of proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility to ordinary course of business expenditures  and in any event  not for the repayment of certain indebtedness  including the convertible senior subordinated notes due may the convertible notes  the convertible senior subordinated notes due november and redeemable at the option of the holders in november the convertible notes and the senior subordinated notes due august the notes 
in addition  we are prohibited from making any acquisitions and we agreed that net proceeds from certain asset sales until may  would be used to permanently reduce the amount available under the revolving credit sub facility as defined below 
in addition  on march   we amended a guaranty and subordination agreement with the landlord of many of our facility leases 
this amendment adjusted the calculation of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio contained in the original guaranty and subordination agreement and added two additional financial covenants a consolidated liquidity ratio covenant and a consolidated total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio covenant 
we continue to explore options related to our debt obligations with the assistance of our financial advisor 
we are currently in discussions with our senior secured lenders to amend our credit facility to  among other things  avoid potential defaults under that facility and permit the restructuring of our other outstanding debt obligations 
if we are unable to restructure our debt obligations  we may not have funds available to repay the million principal amount of our convertible notes that mature on may  if we do not refinance or repay the convertible notes on or before may   we will be in default under our credit facility and other material indebtedness  including our convertible notes and our notes 
in addition  absent further amendments to our credit facility  we may violate the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in our credit facility as of the quarter ending june  and be in default of the terms of that facility  which would otherwise mature in february finally  we are evaluating restructuring options for million principal amount outstanding of convertible notes that we may be required to repurchase at the option of the holders on november  although we will attempt to restructure these debt obligations to avoid events of default under one or more of these arrangements  we cannot assure our investors that we will succeed in these efforts 
a default under one or more of our debt arrangements  including the credit facility  could cause cross defaults of other debt  lease facilities and operating agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and operations and raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to restructure these upcoming debt maturities  we may not be able to continue our operations  and we may be unable to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection and or have an involuntary bankruptcy case filed against us 
business strategy portfolio management 
we continue to evaluate our portfolio of franchises 
efforts are made to divest franchises that do not yield  or are not expected to yield  adequate long term returns  although we may be unable to divest franchises as quickly as we would like  if at all  given current market conditions 
we may also divest 
table of contents profitable franchises to fund our capital needs 
there are no assurances that we will be able to sell these franchises on favorable terms  if at all 
in the most recent amendment to the credit facility  we are prohibited from making any acquisitions and we agreed that net proceeds from certain asset sales until may  would be used to permanently reduce the amount available under the revolving credit sub facility as defined below 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
although we are not currently pursuing acquisition opportunities  our long term growth strategy is focused on large metropolitan markets  predominantly in the southeast  southwest  midwest and california 
we also seek to acquire stable franchises that we believe have above average sales prospects 
a majority of our dealerships are either luxury or mid line import brands 
for the year ended december   of our total revenue was generated by import and luxury dealerships  which generally have higher operating margins  more stable fixed operations departments  lower associate turnover and lower inventory levels 
we expect this trend toward acquiring more luxury and mid line import dealerships to continue over the long term 
the following table depicts the breakdown of our new vehicle revenues by brand brand percentage of new vehicle revenue year ended december  bmw toyota honda mercedes general motors lexus ford cadillac audi volkswagen porsche land rover hyundai other luxury nissan volvo infiniti chrysler acura other total in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

table of contents increase sales of higher margin products and services 
we continue to pursue opportunities to increase our sales of higher margin products and services by expanding the following finance  insurance and other aftermarket products f i each sale of a new or used vehicle provides us with an opportunity to earn financing fees and insurance commissions and to sell extended service contracts and other aftermarket products 
we currently offer a wide range of nonrecourse financing  leasing  other aftermarket products  service contracts and insurance products to our customers 
we emphasize menu selling techniques and other best practices to increase our sales of f i products at both newly acquired and existing dealerships 
parts  service repair each of our dealerships offers a fully integrated service and parts department 
manufacturers permit warranty work to be performed only at franchised dealerships such as ours 
as a result  our franchised dealerships are uniquely qualified and positioned to perform work covered by manufacturer warranties on increasingly complex vehicles 
we believe we can continue to grow our profitable parts and service business over the long term by increasing service capacity  investing in sophisticated equipment and well trained technicians  using variable rate pricing structures  focusing on customer service and efficiently managing our parts inventory 
in addition  we believe our emphasis on selling extended service contracts associated with new and used vehicle retail sales will drive further service and parts business in our dealerships as we increase the potential to retain current customers beyond the term of the standard manufacturer warranty period 
certified pre owned vehicles 
various manufacturers provide franchised dealers the opportunity to sell certified pre owned cpo vehicles 
this certification process extends the standard manufacturer warranty on the cpo vehicle 
we typically earn higher revenues and gross profits on cpo vehicles compared to non certified pre owned vehicles 
we also believe the extended manufacturer warranty increases our potential to retain the pre owned purchaser as a future parts and service customer 
since cpo warranty work can only be performed at franchised dealerships  we believe the used vehicle business will become more clearly segmented and cpo sales and similar products will increase in volume 
value used vehicle 
due to our favorable luxury and import brand mix  our used vehicle strategy has historically been focused on cpo vehicles and other higher cost of sale vehicles 
a market segment that drives used vehicle volume that we historically participated in on only a limited basis is vehicles with retail prices below  until recent years  if we received a trade in which did not meet our then existing internal criteria for used vehicles in many instances these would be value vehicles  we would wholesale the vehicle 
we believe the market for these value vehicles is deeper today  and not as sensitive to market fluctuations as higher priced used vehicles 
as a result  we have shifted our strategy to more aggressively market and retail these vehicles 
emphasize expense control 
we continually focus on controlling expenses and expanding margins at the dealerships we acquire and integrate into our organization 
we manage these costs  such as advertising and variable compensation expenses  so that they are generally related to vehicle sales and can be adjusted in response to changes in vehicle sales volume 
the majority of our non clerical dealership personnel are paid either a commission or a modest salary plus commissions 
in addition  dealership management compensation is tied to individual dealership profitability 
we believe we can further manage these types of costs through best practices  standardization of compensation plans  controlled oversight and accountability  reducing associate turnover and centralizing and standardizing processes and systems such as accounting office consolidation  payroll system consolidation and inventory management technology 
expand our ecommerce capabilities 
automotive customers have become increasingly more comfortable using technology to research their vehicle buying alternatives and communicate with dealership personnel 
our conversion to a single dealer management system has given us the ability to leverage technology to more efficiently integrate systems  customize our dealership websites and use our customer data to improve the effectiveness of our advertising and interaction with our customers 

table of contents achieve high levels of customer satisfaction 
we focus on maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction 
our personalized sales process is designed to satisfy customers by providing high quality vehicles in a positive  consumer friendly buying environment 
several manufacturers offer specific financial incentives on a per vehicle basis if certain customer satisfaction index csi levels which vary by manufacturer are achieved by a dealership 
in addition  all manufacturers consider csi scores in approving acquisitions 
in order to keep management focused on customer satisfaction  we include csi results as a component of our incentive based compensation programs 
train and develop associates 
we believe that our well trained dealership personnel are key to our long term prospects 
our employees  from service technicians to regional vice presidents  participate in our in house training programs each year 
we believe that our comprehensive training of all employees provide us with a competitive advantage over other dealership groups 
relationships with manufacturers each of our dealerships operates under a separate franchise or dealer agreement that governs the relationship between the dealership and the manufacturer 
in general  each dealer agreement specifies the location of the dealership for the sale of vehicles and for the performance of certain approved services in a specified market area 
the designation of such areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory 
in addition  most manufacturers allocate vehicles on a turn and earn basis that rewards high volume 
a dealer agreement requires the dealer to meet specified standards regarding showrooms  facilities and equipment for servicing vehicles  inventories  minimum net working capital  personnel training and other aspects of the business 
each dealer agreement also gives the related manufacturer the right to approve the dealer operator and any material change in management or ownership of the dealership 
each manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances  such as a change in control of the dealership without manufacturer approval  the impairment of the reputation or financial condition of the dealership  the death  removal or withdrawal of the dealer operator  the conviction of the dealership or the dealership s owner or dealer operator of certain crimes  the failure to adequately operate the dealership or maintain new vehicle financing arrangements  insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealership or a material breach of other provisions of the dealer agreement 
many automobile manufacturers have developed policies regarding public ownership of dealerships 
policies implemented by manufacturers include the following restrictions the ability to force the sale of their respective franchises upon a change in control of our company or a material change in the composition of our board of directors  the ability to force the sale of their respective franchises if an automobile manufacturer or distributor acquires more than of the voting power of our securities  and the ability to force the sale of their respective franchises if an individual or entity other than an automobile manufacturer or distributor acquires more than of the voting power of our securities  and the manufacturer disapproves of such individual s or entity s ownership interest 
to the extent that new or amended manufacturer policies restrict the number of dealerships which may be owned by a dealership group  or the transferability of our common stock  such policies could have a material adverse effect on us 
we believe that we will be able to renew at expiration all of our existing franchise and dealer agreements 
many states have placed limitations upon manufacturers and distributors ability to sell new motor vehicles directly to customers in their respective states in an effort to protect dealers from practices they believe constitute unfair competition 
in general  these statutes make it unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor to compete with a new motor vehicle dealer in the same brand operating under an agreement or franchise from the manufacturer or distributor in the relevant market area 
certain states  such as florida  georgia  oklahoma  south carolina  north carolina and virginia  limit the amount of time that a manufacturer may temporarily operate a dealership 

table of contents in addition  all of the states in which our dealerships currently do business require manufacturers to show good cause for terminating or failing to renew a dealer s franchise agreement 
further  each of the states provides some method for dealers to challenge manufacturer attempts to establish dealerships of the same brand in their relevant market area 
competition the retail automotive industry is highly competitive 
depending on the geographic market  we compete both with dealers offering the same brands and product lines as ours and dealers offering other manufacturers vehicles 
we also compete for vehicle sales with auto brokers  leasing companies and services offered on the internet that provide customer referrals to other dealerships or who broker vehicle sales between customers and other dealerships 
we compete with small  local dealerships and with large multi franchise auto dealerships 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in vehicle sales are the location of dealerships  the marketing campaigns conducted by manufacturers  the ability of dealerships to offer an attractive selection of the most popular vehicles  pricing including manufacturer rebates and other special offers and the quality of customer service 
other competitive factors include customer preference for makes of automobiles and manufacturer warranties 
in addition to competition for vehicle sales  we also compete with other auto dealers  service stores  auto parts retailers and independent mechanics in providing parts and service 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are price  the use of factory approved replacement parts  factory trained technicians  the familiarity with a dealer s makes and models and the quality of customer service 
a number of regional and national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than our prices 
in arranging or providing financing for our customers vehicle purchases  we compete with a broad range of financial institutions 
in addition  financial institutions are now offering f i products through the internet  which may reduce our profits on these items 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in providing financing are convenience  interest rates and contract terms 
our success depends  in part  on national and regional automobile buying trends  local and regional economic factors and other regional competitive pressures 
conditions and competitive pressures affecting the markets in which we operate  such as price cutting by dealers in these areas  or in any new markets we enter  could adversely affect us  even though the retail automobile industry as a whole might not be affected 
governmental regulations and environmental matters numerous federal and state regulations govern our business of marketing  selling  financing and servicing automobiles 
we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to business corporations generally 
under the laws of the states in which we currently operate as well as the laws of other states into which we may expand  we must obtain a license in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or operate an automotive repair service 
these laws also regulate our conduct of business  including our sales  operating  advertising  financing and employment practices 
these laws also include federal and state wage hour  anti discrimination and other employment practices laws 
our financing activities with customers are subject to federal truth in lending  consumer privacy  consumer leasing and equal credit opportunity regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws  installment finance laws  usury laws and other installment sales laws 
some states regulate finance fees that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales 

table of contents federal  state and local environmental regulations  including regulations governing air and water quality  the clean up of contaminated property and the use  storage  handling  recycling and disposal of gasoline  oil and other materials  also apply to us and our dealership properties 
we believe that we comply in all material respects with the laws affecting our business 
however  claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of laws may be asserted against us or our dealerships by individuals or governmental entities  and may expose us to significant damages or other penalties  including possible suspension or revocation of our licenses to conduct dealership operations and fines 
as with automobile dealerships generally  and service  parts and body shop operations in particular  our business involves the use  storage  handling and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes and other environmentally sensitive materials 
our business also involves the past and current operation and or removal of above ground and underground storage tanks containing such substances or wastes 
accordingly  we are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities that establish health and environmental quality standards  provide for liability related to those standards  and in certain circumstances provide penalties for violations of those standards 
we are also subject to laws  ordinances and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities we own or operate or to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
we do not have any known material environmental liabilities and we believe that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
however  soil and groundwater contamination is known to exist at certain properties used by us 
further  environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change 
in addition  in connection with our acquisitions  it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities  some of which may be material 
we cannot assure you that compliance with current or amended  or new or more stringent  laws or regulations  stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions will not require additional expenditures by us  or that such expenditures will not be material

table of contents item a risk factors risks related to our sources of financing and liquidity if we do not restructure or obtain additional financing to satisfy our substantial debt obligations  we may not be able to continue as a going concern or we may be unable to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection 
on december   we had billion in total outstanding indebtedness including  but not limited to  approximately million in principal outstanding related to our convertible senior subordinated notes that mature on may  the convertible notes  million under the revolving credit sub facility defined below that matures in february  million in principal outstanding related to our convertible senior subordinated notes redeemable at the holder s option on november  the convertible notes and million in principal outstanding related to our senior subordinated notes due august the notes 
on february   we announced that we hired moelis company as financial advisor to assist us in evaluating alternatives to enhance liquidity and address our debt obligations coming due in and this comprehensive evaluation involves  among other things  amending the revolving credit sub facility as defined below that matures on february  and restructuring the convertible notes and or the convertible notes 
no assurance can be given that we will have sufficient time to implement any alternatives resulting from this evaluation before may  to avoid a payment default under the convertible notes 
such a default could cause a default under our other material indebtedness 
we have no commitment or agreement with respect to any transactions as of the date of the filing of this form k and there can be no assurance that any transaction will be completed 
if we are unable to restructure these upcoming debt obligations  we may not be able to continue our operations and we may be unable to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection and or have an involuntary bankruptcy case filed against us 
as a result  there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
based on current estimates  we may be in default under certain covenants of our credit facility and other indebtedness in based on the near term maturity of our convertible notes if we do not restructure our convertible notes on or prior to may   we believe we will violate covenants under the credit facility  other outstanding indebtedness and agreements related to many of our facility operating leases 
although we have received amendments and modifications to these debt and operating lease agreements in the past  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain amendments and or modifications to avoid or cure events of default in the future 
our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its audit report on our consolidated financial statements that indicated there is an uncertainty that we will remain in compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements and that this uncertainty raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern

see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  on march   we amended a guaranty and subordination agreement with the landlord of many of our facility leases 
this amendment adjusted the calculation of the consolidated fixed charge coverage 
table of contents ratio contained in the original guaranty and subordination agreement and added two additional financial covenants  a consolidated liquidity ratio covenant and a consolidated total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio covenant

a default under one or more of our debt arrangements  including the credit facility  could cause cross defaults of other debt  lease facilities and operating agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and operations and raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our significant indebtedness and near term debt maturities could materially adversely affect our financial health  limit our ability to finance future acquisitions and capital expenditures and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 
as of december   our total outstanding indebtedness was approximately billion  including the following million under the revolving credit sub facility as defined below  classified as current   million under the secured new and used inventory floor plan facilities  including million classified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale  million in convertible notes representing million in aggregate principal amount outstanding less unamortized discount of approximately million  million in convertible notes  classified as current  representing million in aggregate principal amount outstanding less unamortized discount of approximately million  million in notes  classified as current  representing million in aggregate principal amount outstanding less unamortized net discount of approximately million  million of mortgage notes  representing million in aggregate principal amount plus unamortized premium of approximately million  due from june  to september   classified as current  with a weighted average interest rate of  and million of other secured debt  classified as current  representing million in aggregate principal amount plus unamortized premium of approximately million 
as of december   we had million available for additional borrowings under the revolving credit sub facility based on the borrowing base calculation on that date  which is affected by 
table of contents numerous factors including eligible asset balances  the market value of certain collateral and historical consolidated ebitda as defined 
we are also able to borrow under our revolving credit sub facility as defined below only if we are in compliance with our financial and other covenants and all of our representations and warranties contained in the revolving credit sub facility are true on the date of borrowing 
based on the most recent amendment to the credit facility  we can only use proceeds from borrowings for ordinary course of business expenditures 
we also have additional capacity under new and used inventory floor plan facilities 
in addition  the indentures relating to our notes  convertible notes  convertible notes and our other debt instruments allow us to incur additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness  as long as we are in compliance with the terms thereunder 
we refer to the million of availability under a revolving credit facility revolving credit sub facility  up to million in borrowing availability for new vehicle inventory floor plan financing and up to million in borrowing availability for used vehicle inventory floor plan financing collectively as our credit facility 
in addition  the majority of our dealership properties are leased under long term operating lease arrangements that generally have initial terms of fifteen to twenty years with one or two ten year renewal options 
these operating leases require compliance of financial and operating covenants similar to those under our credit facility  monthly payments of rent that may fluctuate based on interest rates and local consumer price indices 
the total future minimum lease payments related to these operating leases and certain equipment leases are significant and are disclosed in the notes to our financial statements under the heading commitments and contingencies in this annual report on form k 
we have approximately billion of debt that mature or which holders may force us to repay in and this leverage could have important consequences to the holders of our securities  including the following we may be forced to sell certain assets at prices below where we might otherwise consider selling such assets in order to repay current maturities of debt  our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital or general corporate purposes or to refinance existing indebtedness may be impaired in the future  a substantial portion of our current cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and rents under long term operating leases  thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations and other purposes  some of our borrowings and facility leases are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which exposes us to the risk of increasing interest rates  significant additional equity could be issued in connection with restructuring our and debt obligations  future interest rates may be higher than those currently applicable to our outstanding debt  the indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility and other floor plan facilities are secured by a pledge of substantially all the assets of our dealerships  which may limit our ability to borrow money from other sources  and we may be substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to changing market conditions and regulations 
in addition  our debt agreements contain numerous covenants that limit our discretion with respect to certain business matters  including mergers or acquisitions  paying dividends  incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or disposing of assets 
these covenants may become more restrictive as a result of refinancing in the current environment 
it is likely that  in connection with restructuring our credit facility  the covenants relevant to these matters will be significantly more restrictive to our business 

table of contents an acceleration of our obligation to repay all or a substantial portion of our outstanding indebtedness or lease obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our credit facility  the indenture governing our notes and many of our facility operating leases contain numerous financial and operating covenants 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement or indenture 
if a default were to occur  we may be unable to adequately finance our operations and the value of our common stock would be materially adversely affected because of acceleration and cross default 
in addition  a default under one agreement or indenture could result in a default and acceleration of our repayment obligations under the other agreements or indentures  including the indentures governing our outstanding convertible notes  convertible notes and the notes  under the cross default provisions in those agreements or indentures 
if a cross default were to occur  we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
even if new financing were available  it may not be on terms acceptable to us 
as a result of this risk  we could be forced to take actions that we otherwise would not take  or not take actions that we otherwise might take  in order to comply with the covenants in these agreements and indentures 
our ability to make interest and principal payments when due to holders of our debt securities depends upon our future performance 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  domestic and foreign economic conditions  the regulatory environment and other factors  many of which we are unable to control 
if our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt as it becomes due  we may be required to refinance the debt  sell assets or sell shares of our stock on terms that we do not find attractive  if it can be done at all 
further  our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to the credit facility and the indentures pertaining to our outstanding notes could result in a default under these agreements that would prevent us from borrowing under the revolving credit sub facility  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to make interest and principal payments when due to holders of our debt securities depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries 
substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries and substantially all of our consolidated cash flow and net income are generated by our subsidiaries 
accordingly  our cash flow and ability to service debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with cash 
we may receive cash from our subsidiaries in the form of dividends  loans or otherwise 
we may use this cash to service our debt obligations or for working capital 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to distribute cash to us or to make funds available to service debt 
in addition  the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make loans to us are subject to contractual limitations under the floor plan facilities  minimum net capital requirements under manufacturer franchise agreements and laws of the state in which a subsidiary is organized and depend to a significant degree on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and other business considerations 
in addition  if we sell a dealership subsidiary  our cash flows will decline and  consequently  the sale of a significant portion of our dealership subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
we may need to sell certain assets to raise capital in connection with restructuring our and maturities 
we may need to sell certain assets including dealerships and subsidiaries in order to satisfy our and debt obligations 
we may determine to sell profitable dealerships that we may otherwise want to retain 
there are no assurances that we will be able to sell such assets on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  in the most recent amendment to the credit facility  we agreed that net proceeds from certain assets sales until may  would be used to repay loans made under the credit facility 
the sale of profitable assets will reduce our profitability in future periods 

table of contents we depend on the performance of sublessees to offset costs related to certain of our lease agreements 
in most cases when we sell a dealership franchise  the buyer of the franchise will sublease the dealership property from us  but we are not released from the underlying lease obligation to the primary landlord 
we rely on the sublease income from the buyer to offset the expense incurred related to our obligation to pay the primary landlord 
we also rely on the buyer to maintain the property in accordance with the terms of the sublease which in most cases mirror the terms of the lease we have with the primary landlord 
although we assess the financial condition of a buyer at the time we sell the franchise  and seek to obtain guarantees of the buyer s sublease obligation from the stockholders or affiliates of the buyer  the financial condition of the buyer and or the sublease guarantors may deteriorate over time 
in the event the buyer does not perform under the terms of the sublease agreement due to the buyer s financial condition or other factors  we may not be able to recover amounts owed to us under the terms of the sublease agreement or the related guarantees 
our operating results  financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected if sublessees do not perform their obligations under the terms of the sublease agreements 
our use of hedging transactions could limit our gains and result in financial losses 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flow due to interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into  and in the future expect to enter into  derivative instruments or hedging agreements 
no hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates  as of december  sonic had interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of its libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
see derivative instruments and hedging activities under note to our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to december   we settled our million notional  pay and million notional  pay swaps with a payment to the counterparty of million 
we generally intend to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as management determines is in our best interests given the cost of such hedging transactions 
our hedging transactions expose us to certain risks and financial losses  including  among other things counterparty credit risk  available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which we seek protection  the duration of the amount of the hedge may not match the duration or amount of the related liability  the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction  and the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value 
downward adjustments  or mark to market losses  would reduce our stockholders equity 
a failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
such issuances may dilute the value of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we believe we will require additional capital in and or to i address the and debt obligations discussed above  ii expand our business and increase revenues  iii add liquidity in response to continued negative economic conditions  and iv meet unexpected liquidity needs caused by industry volatility and or uncertainty 
to the extent that our existing capital and borrowing capabilities are insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses  we will need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings  
table of contents including offerings of our common stock  securities convertible into our common stock or rights to acquire our common stock or curtail our growth and reduce our assets or restructure arrangements with existing security holders 
any equity or debt financing  or additional borrowings  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
equity financings could result in dilution to our stockholders  and the securities issued in future financings may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock 
if our need for capital arises because of significant losses  the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms if and when needed  we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities  grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
we may need to issue significant amounts of equity to the holders of our and debt obligations in connection with any debt restructuring 
because of the currently depressed price of our common stock  if we raise funds through an equity offering  we would need to issue a large amount of common stock to raise a significant amount of cash  which will be dilutive  will decrease the ownership percentage of current outstanding stockholders and may result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
any large issuance may also result in a change in control of the company which could result in a default under our debt instruments or make such debt instruments effectively due and payable 
our depressed stock price could jeopardize our listing on the new york stock exchange nyse  affect our ability to raise equity in the future and enable the holders of our convertible notes to require us to redeem their convertible notes 
current conditions in both the capital markets as well as in the automotive retailing industry have depressed the value of our common stock 
at december   our common stock closed at per share and we had a market capitalization of million  representing a and decline in our stock price and market capitalization  respectively  from december  as of march   our common stock closed at per share and we had a market capitalization of approximately million 
nyse rules require  among other things  that the average closing price of our class a common stock be not less than over a consecutive day period or the average global market capitalization over a consecutive day trading period be more than million 
during two consecutive days during the month of march  our stock traded at levels below per share 
although the nyse has temporarily suspended or modified these listing standards  we cannot assure you that we will comply with these and other listing standards in the future 
if we do not satisfy such listing standards our class a common stock could be delisted from the nyse and traded only in the over the counter market 
this could limit our ability to raise new equity capital in the future and cause our existing equity securities to trade at lower values  and would give holders of our convertible notes the right to require us to repurchase the convertible notes 
such a repayment event could have a material adverse effect on our business and our liquidity 
risks related to our relationships with vehicle manufacturers our operations may be adversely affected if one or more of our manufacturer franchise agreements is terminated or not renewed 
each of our dealerships operates under a franchise agreement with the applicable automobile manufacturer or distributor 
without a franchise agreement  we cannot obtain new vehicles from a manufacturer 
as a result  we are significantly dependent on our relationships with these manufacturers 
manufacturers exercise a great degree of control over the operations of our dealerships through the franchise agreements 
the franchise agreements govern  among other things  our ability to purchase vehicles from the manufacturer and to sell vehicles to customers 
each of our franchise agreements provides for termination or non renewal for a variety of causes  including certain changes in the financial condition of the dealerships and any unapproved change of ownership or management 
manufacturers may also have a right of first refusal if we seek to sell dealerships 

table of contents actions taken by manufacturers to exploit their superior bargaining position in negotiating the terms of franchise agreements or renewals of these agreements or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we cannot guarantee you that any of our existing franchise agreements will be renewed or that the terms and conditions of such renewals will be favorable to us 
our sales volume and profit margin on each sale may be materially adversely affected if manufacturers discontinue or change their incentive programs 
our dealerships depend on the manufacturers for certain sales incentives  warranties and other programs that are intended to promote and support dealership new vehicle sales 
manufacturers routinely modify their incentive programs in response to changing market conditions 
some of the key incentive programs include customer rebates or below market financing on new vehicles  employee pricing  dealer incentives on new vehicles  manufacturer floor plan interest and advertising assistance  warranties on new and used vehicles  and sponsorship of used vehicle sales by authorized new vehicle dealers 
manufacturers frequently offer incentives to potential customers 
a reduction or discontinuation of a manufacturer s incentive programs may materially adversely impact vehicle demand and affect our profitability 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  general motors delayed payments related to certain incentive programs 
in the event this delay was longer or of greater scale  the effect on our overall liquidity could have been material 
our sales volume may be materially adversely affected if manufacturer captives change their customer financing programs or are unable to provide floor plan financing 
one of the primary finance sources used by consumers in connection with the purchase of a new or used vehicle is the manufacturer captive finance companies 
these captive finance companies rely  to a certain extent  on the public debt markets to provide the capital necessary to support their financing programs 
in addition  the captive finance companies will occasionally change their loan underwriting criteria to alter the risk profile of their loan portfolio 
a limitation or reduction of available consumer financing for these or other reasons could affect a consumer s ability to purchase a vehicle  and thus  could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume 
for example  for a period of time in the fourth quarter  gmac stated they would not make loans to customers with fico credit scores below if this continues or if consumer credit is further restricted  the adverse effect on our overall liquidity could be material 
our parts and service sales volume and profitability are dependent on manufacturer warranty programs 
franchised automotive retailers perform service work and sell replacement parts on vehicles covered by warranties issued by the automotive manufacturer 
dealerships which perform work covered by a manufacturer warranty are reimbursed at rates established by the manufacturer 
for the year ended december   approximately of our parts and service revenue was for work covered by manufacturer warranties 
to the extent a manufacturer reduces the labor rates or markup of replacement parts for such warranty work  our fixed operations sales volume and profitability could be adversely affected 
we depend on manufacturers to supply us with sufficient numbers of popular and profitable new models 
manufacturers typically allocate their vehicles among dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership 
supplies of popular new vehicles may be limited by the applicable manufacturer s production 
table of contents capabilities 
popular new vehicles that are in limited supply typically produce the highest profit margins 
we depend on manufacturers to provide us with a desirable mix of popular new vehicles 
our operating results may be materially adversely affected if we do not obtain a sufficient supply of these vehicles 
adverse conditions affecting one or more key manufacturers may negatively impact our profitability 
during the year ended december   approximately of our new vehicle revenue was derived from the sale of new vehicles manufactured by bmw  honda including acura  toyota including lexus  mercedes  general motors including cadillac and ford 
our success depends to a great extent on these manufacturers financial condition  marketing  vehicle design  publicity concerning a particular manufacturer or vehicle model  production capabilities  management  reputation  and labor relations 
events such as labor strikes that may adversely affect a manufacturer may also adversely affect us 
in particular  labor strikes at a manufacturer that continue for a substantial period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business 
similarly  the delivery of vehicles from manufacturers at a time later than scheduled  which may occur particularly during periods of new product introductions  could limit sales of those vehicles during those periods 
this has been experienced at some of our dealerships from time to time 
adverse conditions affecting these and other important aspects of manufacturers operations and public relations may adversely affect our ability to sell their automobiles and  as a result  significantly and detrimentally affect our profitability 
in recent years and particularly in the latter half of  the financial condition and operating results of ford  general motors and chrysler have deteriorated significantly 
as of december   we owned ford franchises including volvo  general motors franchises including cadillac  saab  saturn  chevrolet  buick  gmc  hummer and pontiac and chrysler franchises including jeep  dodge and chrysler 
if the financial condition and operating results of ford  general motors or chrysler do not improve or if the us government discontinues or limits aid to these manufacturers  it is possible that each manufacturer could file for bankruptcy protection 
such a bankruptcy filing by any of ford  general motors or chrysler could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in general and our domestic brand dealerships specifically 

table of contents the following reflects certain balance sheet data regarding our general motors  ford including volvo and chrysler assets as of december  and december  dollars in millions general motors new vehicle inventory parts inventory factory receivables franchise assets ford including volvo new vehicle inventory parts inventory factory receivables franchise assets chrysler new vehicle inventory parts inventory factory receivables franchise assets in addition  we rely on the manufacturer captive finance companies of general motors  ford and chrysler for new vehicle floor plan financing 
the bankruptcy of any of these domestic manufacturers could result in an attempt by the related captive finance company to terminate our floor plan financing  which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and liquidity position 
manufacturer stock ownership restrictions may impair our ability to maintain or renew franchise agreements or issue additional equity 
some of our franchise agreements prohibit transfers of any ownership interests of a dealership and  in some cases  its parent  without prior approval of the applicable manufacturer 
a number of manufacturers impose restrictions on the transferability of our class a common stock and our ability to maintain franchises if a person acquires a significant percentage of the voting power of our common stock 
our existing franchise agreements could be terminated if a person or entity acquires a substantial ownership interest in us or acquires voting power above certain levels without the applicable manufacturer s approval 
violations of these levels by an investor are generally outside of our control and may result in the termination or non renewal of existing franchise agreements or impair our ability to negotiate new franchise agreements for dealerships we acquire in the future 
in addition  if we cannot obtain any requisite approvals on a timely basis  we may not be able to issue additional equity or otherwise raise capital on terms acceptable to us 
these restrictions may also prevent or deter a prospective acquirer from acquiring control of us 
this could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and also may limit our ability to restructure our debt obligations 
the current holders of our class b common stock maintain voting control over us 
however  we are unable to prevent our stockholders from transferring shares of our common stock  including transfers by holders of the class b common stock 
if such transfer results in a change in control  it could result in the termination or non renewal of one or more of our existing franchise agreements  the triggering of provisions in our agreements with certain manufacturers requiring us to sell our dealerships franchised with such manufacturers and or a default under our credit arrangements 

table of contents our dealers depend upon vehicle sales and  therefore  their success depends in large part upon customer demand for the particular vehicles they carry 
the success of our dealerships depends in large part on the overall success of the vehicle lines they carry 
new vehicle sales generate the majority of our total revenue and lead to sales of higher margin products and services such as finance  insurance  vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products  and parts and service operations 
although we have sought to limit our dependence on any one vehicle brand and our parts and service operations and used vehicle sales may serve to offset some of this risk  we have focused our new vehicle sales operations in mid line import and luxury brands 
our failure to meet a manufacturer s customer satisfaction  financial and sales performance and facility requirements may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships and our profitability 
many manufacturers attempt to measure customers satisfaction with their sales and warranty service experiences through manufacturer determined csi scores 
the components of csi vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and are modified periodically 
franchise agreements also may impose financial and sales performance standards 
under our agreements with certain manufacturers  a dealership s csi scores  sales and financial performance may be considered a factor in evaluating applications for additional dealership acquisitions 
from time to time  some of our dealerships have had difficulty meeting various manufacturers csi requirements or performance standards 
we cannot assure you that our dealerships will be able to comply with these requirements in the future 
a manufacturer may refuse to consent to an acquisition of one of its franchises if it determines our dealerships do not comply with its csi requirements or performance standards  which could impair the execution of our acquisition strategy 
in addition  we receive incentive payments from the manufacturers based  in part  on csi scores  which could be materially adversely affected if our csi scores decline 
in addition  a manufacturer may condition its allotment of vehicles  participation in bonus programs  or acquisition of additional franchises upon our compliance with its facility standards 
this may put us in a competitive disadvantage with other competing dealerships and may ultimately result in our decision to sell a franchise when we believe it may be difficult to recover the cost of the required investment to reach the manufacturer s facility standards 
if state dealer laws are repealed or weakened  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their franchise agreements 
state dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or nonrenewal 
some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or nonrenewal 
though unsuccessful to date  manufacturers lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of state dealer laws 
if dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice  an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of state dealer laws  it may also be more difficult for our dealers to renew their franchise agreements upon expiration 
in addition  these laws restrict the ability of automobile manufacturers to directly enter the retail market in the future 
however  the ability of a manufacturer to grant additional franchises is based on several factors which are not within our control 
if manufacturers grant new franchises in areas near or within our existing markets  this could significantly impact our revenues and or profitability 
further  if manufacturers obtain the ability to directly retail vehicles and do so in our markets  such competition could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents risks related to our acquisition strategy pursuant to the terms of the most recent amendment to the credit facility  our ability to make acquisitions is restricted 
pursuant to the most recent amendment to the credit facility  we are prohibited from making acquisitions 
this restriction will continue until we either further amend or refinance the credit facility 
we may be forced to sell dealerships in connection with such an amendment or restructuring 
without the ability to make acquisitions  our growth strategy will be limited 
in addition  due to these restrictions  we may forfeit the opportunity to acquire profitable dealerships at attractive valuations and may forfeit the opportunity for additional franchise awards from manufacturers 
we may not be able to capitalize on acquisition opportunities because our ability to obtain capital to fund these acquisitions is limited 
we intend to finance our acquisitions with cash generated from operations  through issuances of our stock or debt securities and through borrowings under credit arrangements 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing by issuing stock or debt securities due to the market price of our class a common stock  overall market conditions or the need for manufacturer consent to the issuance of equity securities 
using cash to complete acquisitions could substantially limit our operating or financial flexibility 
in addition  we are dependent to a significant extent on our ability to finance our new vehicle inventory with floor plan financing 
floor plan financing arrangements allow us to borrow money to buy a particular vehicle from the manufacturer and pay off the loan when we sell that particular vehicle 
we must obtain new floor plan financing or obtain consents to assume existing floor plan financing in connection with our acquisition of dealerships 
substantially all the assets of our dealerships are pledged to secure the indebtedness under the credit facility and our separate floor plan indebtedness with lenders  including the captive finance subsidiaries of bmw  chrysler  ford  general motors and mercedes 
these pledges may impede our ability to borrow from other sources 
moreover  because the identified manufacturer captive finance subsidiaries are either owned or affiliated with bmw  mercedes  chrysler  ford  general motors  nissan and toyota  respectively  any deterioration of our relationship with the particular captive finance subsidiary could adversely affect our relationship with the affiliated manufacturer  and vice versa 
manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions could limit our future growth 
although we have currently suspended our plans to grow our business through acquisitions  we intend to grow through acquisitions in the future 
we are required to obtain the approval of the applicable manufacturer before we can acquire an additional dealership franchise of that manufacturer 
in determining whether to approve an acquisition  manufacturers may consider many factors such as our financial condition and csi scores 
obtaining manufacturer approval of acquisitions also takes a significant amount of time  typically three to five months 
we cannot assure you that manufacturers will approve future acquisitions or do so on a timely basis  which could impair the execution of our acquisition strategy 
certain manufacturers also limit the number of its dealerships that we may own  our national market share of that manufacturer s products or the number of dealerships we may own in a particular geographic area 
in addition  under an applicable franchise agreement or under state law  a manufacturer may have a right of first refusal to acquire a dealership that we seek to acquire 
a manufacturer may condition approval of an acquisition on the implementation of material changes in our operations or extraordinary corporate transactions  facilities improvements or other capital expenditures 
if we are unable or unwilling to comply with these conditions  we may be required to sell the assets of that manufacturer s dealerships or terminate our franchise agreement 

table of contents failure to effectively integrate acquired dealerships with our existing operations could adversely affect our future operating results 
our future operating results depend on our ability to integrate the operations of recently acquired dealerships  as well as dealerships we acquire in the future  with our existing operations 
in particular  we need to integrate our management information systems  procedures and organizational structures  which can be difficult 
our growth strategy has focused on the pursuit of strategic acquisitions that either expand or complement our business 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively and profitably integrate the operations of these dealerships without substantial costs  delays or operational or financial problems  due to the difficulties of managing operations located in geographic areas where we have not previously operated  the management time and attention required to integrate and manage newly acquired dealerships  the difficulties of assimilating and retaining employees  the challenges of keeping customers  and the challenge of retaining or attracting appropriate dealership management personnel 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not adequately anticipate all of the demands that growth through acquisitions will impose 
in pursuing a strategy of acquiring other dealerships  we face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions 
these risks include  but are not limited to incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses  failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of acquired dealerships  entering new markets with which we are unfamiliar  potential undiscovered liabilities and operational difficulties at acquired dealerships  disrupting our ongoing business  diverting our management resources  failing to maintain uniform standards  controls and policies  impairing relationships with employees  manufacturers and customers as a result of changes in management  increased expenses for accounting and computer systems  as well as integration difficulties  failure to obtain a manufacturer s consent to the acquisition of one or more of its dealership franchises or renew the franchise agreement on terms acceptable to us  and incorrectly valuing entities to be acquired 
we may not adequately anticipate all of the demands that growth will impose on our systems  procedures and structures 
we may not be able to reinstitute our acquisition strategy without the costs of future acquisitions escalating 
we have grown our business primarily through acquisitions 
we may not be able to consummate any future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms or identify suitable candidates 
in addition  increased competition for 
table of contents acquisition candidates could result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us and higher acquisition prices 
the magnitude  timing  pricing and nature of future acquisitions will depend upon various factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  competition with other dealer groups for suitable acquisitions  the negotiation of acceptable terms with the seller and with the manufacturer  our financial capabilities and ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms  our stock price  and the availability of skilled employees to manage the acquired companies 
we may not be able to determine the actual financial condition of dealerships we acquire until after we complete the acquisition and take control of the dealerships 
the operating and financial condition of acquired businesses cannot be determined accurately until we assume control 
although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses we purchase  in light of the circumstances of each transaction  an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual operating condition of these businesses 
similarly  many of the dealerships we acquire  including some of our largest acquisitions  do not have financial statements audited or prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we may not have an accurate understanding of the historical financial condition and performance of our acquired entities 
until we actually assume control of business assets and their operations  we may not be able to ascertain the actual value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired entities and their operations 
although o 
bruton smith  our chairman and chief executive officer  and his affiliates have previously assisted us with obtaining financing  we cannot assure you that he or they will be willing or able to do so in the future 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured with a pledge of five million shares of speedway motorsports  inc common stock  a publicly traded owner and operator of automobile racing facilities 
these shares of speedway motorsports  inc common stock are owned by sonic financial corporation sfc  an entity controlled by mr 
smith 
presently  the million borrowing limit of our revolving credit sub facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation that is based  in part  on the value of the speedway motorsports shares pledged by sfc 
consequently  a withdrawal of this pledge by sfc or a significant decrease in the value of speedway motorsports common stock could reduce the amount we can borrow under the revolving credit sub facility 
in the past  mr 
smith has also guaranteed additional indebtedness incurred to complete certain dealership acquisitions 
mr 
smith may not be willing or able to provide similar guarantees or credit support in the future 
this could impair our ability to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms 
risks related to the automotive retail industry increasing competition among automotive retailers reduces our profit margins on vehicle sales and related businesses 
further  the use of the internet in the car purchasing process could materially adversely affect us 
automobile retailing is a highly competitive business 
our competitors include publicly and privately owned dealerships  some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
many of our competitors sell the same or similar makes of new and used vehicles that we offer in our markets at competitive prices 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers due to economies of scale or otherwise 
in addition  the popularity of short term vehicle leasing in the past few years has resulted  as 
table of contents these leases expire  in a large increase in the number of late model used vehicles available in the market  which puts added pressure on new and used vehicle margins 
we typically rely on advertising  merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation and dealership location to sell new vehicles 
our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected if manufacturers decide to enter the retail market directly 
our f i business and other related businesses  which have higher margins than sales of new and used vehicles  are subject to strong competition from various financial institutions and other third parties 
the internet has become a significant part of the sales process in our industry 
customers are using the internet to compare pricing for cars and related f i services  which may further reduce margins for new and used cars and profits for related f i services 
if internet new vehicle sales are allowed to be conducted without the involvement of franchised dealers  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  other franchise groups have aligned themselves with services offered on the internet or are investing heavily in the development of their own internet capabilities  which could materially adversely affect our business 
our franchise agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer s product within a given geographic area 
our revenues or profitability could be materially adversely affected if any of our manufacturers award franchises to others in the same markets where we operate or if existing franchised dealers increase their market share in our markets 
we may face increasingly significant competition as we strive to gain market share through acquisitions or otherwise 
our operating margins may decline over time as we expand into markets where we do not have a leading position 
our business will be harmed if overall consumer demand continues to suffer from a severe or sustained downturn 
our business is heavily dependent on consumer demand and preferences 
our revenues have been materially and adversely affected by the recent downturn in overall levels of consumer spending 
we expect this downturn to continue through at least retail vehicle sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
these cycles are often dependent on general economic conditions and consumer confidence  as well as the level of discretionary personal income and credit availability 
economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our retail business  particularly sales of new and used automobiles 
in addition  severe or sustained increases in gasoline prices may lead to a reduction in automobile purchases or a shift in buying patterns from luxury and sport utility vehicle models which typically provide high margins to retailers to smaller  more economical vehicles which typically have lower margins 
a decline of available financing in the lending market has  and may continue to  adversely affect our vehicle sales volume 
a significant portion of vehicle buyers  particularly in the used car market  finance their purchases of automobiles 
sub prime lenders have historically provided financing for consumers who  for a variety of reasons including poor credit histories and lack of down payment  do not have access to more traditional finance sources 
in the event lenders further tighten their credit standards or there is a further decline in the availability of credit in the lending market  the ability of these consumers to purchase vehicles could be limited which could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues and profitability 
our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions and foreign trade risks that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles profitably 
a significant portion of our new vehicle business involves the sale of vehicles  parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  our operations are subject to customary risks of 
table of contents importing merchandise  including fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  import duties  exchange controls  trade restrictions  work stoppages and general political and socio economic conditions in other countries 
the united states or the countries from which our products are imported may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adjust presently prevailing quotas  duties or tariffs  which may affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and or parts at reasonable prices 
the seasonality of our business magnifies the importance of second and third quarter operating results 
our business is subject to seasonal variations in revenues 
in our experience  demand for automobiles is generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
we therefore receive a disproportionate amount of revenues generally in the second and third quarters and expect our revenues and operating results to be generally lower in the first and fourth quarters 
consequently  if conditions surface during the second and third quarters that impair vehicle sales  such as higher fuel costs  depressed economic conditions or similar adverse conditions  our revenues for the year could be adversely affected 
general risks related to investing in our securities concentration of voting power and anti takeover provisions of our charter  bylaws  delaware law and our dealer agreements may reduce the likelihood of any potential change of control 
our common stock is divided into two classes with different voting rights 
this dual class stock ownership allows the present holders of the class b common stock to control us 
holders of class a common stock have one vote per share on all matters 
holders of class b common stock have votes per share on all matters  except that they have only one vote per share on any transaction proposed or approved by the board of directors or a class b common stockholder or otherwise benefiting the class b common stockholders constituting a going private transaction  disposition of substantially all of our assets  transfer resulting in a change in the nature of our business  or merger or consolidation in which current holders of common stock would own less than of the common stock following such transaction 
the holders of class b common stock currently hold less than a majority of our outstanding common stock  but a majority of our voting power which include o 
bruton smith sonic chairman  chief executive officer and director  his family members and entities they control 
this may prevent or discourage a change of control of us even if the action was favored by holders of class a common stock 
our charter and bylaws make it more difficult for our stockholders to take corporate actions at stockholders meetings 
in addition  stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under our stock option plan and stock incentive plan become immediately exercisable or automatically vest upon a change in control 
delaware law also makes it difficult for stockholders who have recently acquired a large interest in a company to consummate a business combination transaction with the company against its directors wishes 
finally  restrictions imposed by our dealer agreements may impede or prevent any potential takeover bid 
generally  our franchise agreements allow the manufacturers the right to terminate the agreements upon a change of control of our company and impose restrictions upon the transferability of any significant percentage of our stock to any one person or entity who may be unqualified  as defined by the manufacturer  to own one of its dealerships 
the inability of a person or entity to qualify with one or more of our manufacturers may prevent or seriously impede a potential takeover bid 
in addition  provisions of our lending arrangements create an event of default on a change in control 
these agreements  corporate governance documents and laws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or preventing stockholders from realizing a premium on the sale of their shares if we were acquired 

table of contents the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings we are or may become involved in could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and profitability 
we are involved  and expect to continue to be involved  in numerous legal and administrative proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business  including regulatory investigations and private civil actions brought by plaintiffs purporting to represent a potential class or for which a class has been certified 
several private civil actions have been filed against sonic automotive  inc and several of our dealership subsidiaries that purport to represent classes of customers as potential plaintiffs and make allegations that certain products sold in the finance and insurance departments were done so in a deceptive or otherwise illegal manner 
one of these private civil actions has been filed in south carolina state court against sonic automotive  inc and of our south carolina subsidiaries 
this group of plaintiffs attorneys has filed another one of these private civil class action lawsuits in state court in north carolina seeking certification of a multi state class of plaintiffs 
the south carolina state court action and the north carolina state court action have since been consolidated into a single proceeding in private arbitration 
the outcomes of the civil actions brought by plaintiffs purporting to represent a class of customers  as well as other pending and future legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes  class actions  purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities  cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or prospects 
our company is a defendant in the matter of galura  et al 
v 
sonic automotive  inc  a private civil action filed in the circuit court of hillsborough county  florida 
in this action  originally filed on december   the plaintiffs allege that we and our florida dealerships sold an antitheft protection product in a deceptive or otherwise illegal manner  and further sought representation on behalf of any customer of any of our florida dealerships who purchased the antitheft protection product since december  the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief on behalf of this class of customers 
in june  the court granted the plaintiffs motion for certification of the requested class of customers  but the court has made no finding to date regarding actual liability in this lawsuit 
we have subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the court s class certification ruling with the florida court of appeals 
in april  the florida court of appeals affirmed a portion of the trial court s class certification  and overruled a portion of the trial court s class certification 
we intend to continue our vigorous defense of this lawsuit  including the aforementioned appeal of the trial court s class certification order  and to assert available defenses 
however  an adverse resolution of this lawsuit could result in the payment of significant costs and damages  which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our business may be adversely affected by claims alleging violations of laws and regulations in our advertising  sales and finance and insurance activities 
our business is highly regulated 
in the past several years  private plaintiffs and state attorney generals have increased their scrutiny of advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles 
the conduct of our business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding unfair  deceptive and or fraudulent trade practices including advertising  marketing  sales  insurance  repair and promotion practices  truth in lending  consumer leasing  fair credit practices  equal credit opportunity  privacy  insurance  motor vehicle finance  installment finance  closed end credit  usury and other installment sales 
claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or any of our dealers by individuals  either individually or through class actions  or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings 
such actions may expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses and franchises to conduct dealership operations 

table of contents our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in our local markets  even if those conditions are not prominent nationally 
our performance is subject to local economic  competitive  weather and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate 
we may not be able to expand geographically and any geographic expansion may not adequately insulate us from the adverse effects of local or regional economic conditions 
in addition  due to the provisions and terms contained in our operating lease agreements  we may not be able to relocate a dealership operation to a more favorable location without incurring significant costs or penalties 
the loss of key personnel and limited management and personnel resources could adversely affect our operations and growth 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team  particularly our senior management  and service and sales personnel 
additionally  manufacturer franchise agreements may require the prior approval of the applicable manufacturer before any change is made in franchise general managers 
we do not have employment agreements with certain members of our senior management team  our dealership managers and other key dealership personnel 
consequently  the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  as we expand we may need to hire additional managers 
the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate  particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel  is highly competitive and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 
the loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the lack of qualified management or employees employed by potential acquisition candidates may limit our ability to consummate future acquisitions 
governmental regulation and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
we are subject to a wide range of federal  state and local laws and regulations  such as local licensing requirements  retail financing and consumer protection laws and regulations  and wage hour  anti discrimination and other employment practices laws and regulations 
our facilities and operations are also subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety  including those governing wastewater discharges  air emissions  the operation and removal of underground and aboveground storage tanks  the use  storage  treatment  transportation  release  recycling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated property or water 
the violation of these laws and regulations can result in administrative  civil or criminal penalties against us or in a cease and desist order against our operations that are not in compliance 
our future acquisitions may also be subject to regulation  including antitrust reviews 
we believe that we comply in all material respects with all laws and regulations applicable to our business  but future regulations may be more stringent and require us to incur significant additional compliance costs 
our past and present business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required by these laws to pay the full amount of the costs of investigation and or remediation of contaminated properties  even if we are not at fault for disposal of the materials or if such disposal was legal at the time 
like many of our competitors  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  soil and groundwater contamination exists at certain of our properties 
we cannot assure you that our other properties have not been or will not become similarly contaminated 
in addition  we could become subject to potentially material new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities because of our acquisitions

sonic recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge in continuing operations of million at december  and a million charge related to franchises held for sale in discontinued operations 
an estimate was recorded because we had not finalized the valuation of certain assets and liabilities that are necessary for us to complete our evaluation 
we expect to complete this evaluation and finalize the amounts related to the impairment charge which will be reflected in our form q for the fiscal quarter ended march   with any adjustment to the estimate recorded at december  affecting the results of the first quarter of as of december   after recording this charge for impairment  our balance sheet reflected a carrying amount of approximately million in goodwill including goodwill classified as assets held for sale

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
economic conditions beginning near the end of the second quarter and throughout the third and fourth quarters of  the automobile retailing industry was severely negatively affected by prevailing economic conditions 
the uncertainty that exists related to the overall economy in the united states continues through the date of this report 
during the second and third quarters of  increases in fuel prices affected consumer preferences and shifted the sales mix between traditionally more profitable trucks and suvs to more fuel efficient vehicles 
fuel prices began to decline during the fourth quarter of  however there is much uncertainty as to how they will trend in the future 
as discussed in the paragraphs that follow  the demand for new and used vehicles has declined significantly and has negatively impacted our results of operations 
due to the turmoil in the financial services industry  the availability of credit has declined substantially for all consumers except those with high credit scores 
typical sources of financing  including captive finance companies associated with vehicle manufacturers  have also reduced the amount of credit available 
for example  general motors acceptance corporation gmac historically has been a substantial source of lease financing to customers and floor plan financing to dealers  announced during the third quarter of that it was reducing the scope of its leasing activities 
for a period of time in the fourth quarter  gmac stated they would not make loans to customers with fico credit scores below the lack of liquidity resulting from the financial services industry crisis has also hindered our ability to refinance our upcoming debt obligations in and certain industry analysts believe current industry conditions will continue through the latter part of without any noticeable improvement and for recovery to begin in early we cannot predict when the recovery will begin and the timing of its impact on our business 
as discussed in item a  risk factors in this report  our business is cyclical in nature and dependent on consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the sonic automotive  inc and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the financial and statistical data contained in the following discussion for all periods presented reflects our december  classification of franchises between continuing and discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states 
as of march   we operated dealership franchises  representing different brands of cars and light trucks  at locations and collision repair centers in states 
our dealerships provide comprehensive services including sales of both new and used cars and light trucks  sales of replacement parts  performance of vehicle maintenance  manufacturer warranty repairs  paint and collision repair services  and arrangement of extended service contracts  financing  insurance and other aftermarket products for our customers 
although vehicle sales are cyclical and are affected by many factors  including general economic conditions  consumer confidence  levels of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit  our parts  service and collision repair services are not closely tied to vehicle sales and are not as dependent upon near term sales volume 
the automobile industry s total amount of new vehicles sold decreased by to million vehicles in from million vehicles in from an industry perspective  new vehicle unit sales on a year over year basis declined for import brands and for domestic brands 
current industry expectations for new vehicle sales volume in are between and million vehicles  an additional to decrease from further declines in consumer confidence  continued disruption in consumer financing availability or continued deterioration of the automotive manufacturers financial stability could cause these industry expectations to decline further 
many factors such as brand and geographic concentrations have caused our past results to differ from the industry s overall trend 

table of contents as a result of the way we manage our business  we have a single operating segment for purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate our dealership franchises for possible disposition based on various performance criteria 
during the year ended december   we disposed of ten franchises and  at december   had an additional franchises or physical dealerships held for sale 
these franchises have been identified as held for sale because of unprofitable operations or other strategic considerations 
in the future we may also sell other franchises that are not currently held for sale 
we believe the disposition of these franchises will  in addition to providing additional liquidity  allow us to focus our management attention on the remaining stores 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in disposing these franchises at reasonable values given the current market 
although we focus on managing our inventory levels in accordance with consumer demand  we maintain a minimum level of inventory at our lower volume stores necessary to represent the full line of vehicles offered by manufacturers 
this may result in a higher days supply of inventory than would otherwise result in a better economic environment 
however  given our inventory management practices such as managing our inventory purchases based on our sales forecasts and sharing inventory among our stores within a local market  we do not believe the current business climate is likely to result in material impairment charges related to new vehicle inventory 
we continue to monitor our new vehicle inventory balances closely based on current economic conditions and will adjust them as required 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the following is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
finance  insurance and service contracts we arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the lender either in a flat fee amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the actual interest rates charged to customers and the predetermined base rates set by the financing institution 
we also receive commissions from the sale of various insurance contracts and non recourse third party extended service contracts to customers 
under these contracts  the applicable manufacturer or third party warranty company is directly liable for all warranties provided within the contract 
in the event a customer terminates a financing  insurance or extended service contract prior to the original termination date  we may be required to return a portion of the commission revenue originally recorded to the third party provider chargebacks 
the commission revenue for the sale of these products and services is recorded net of estimated chargebacks at the time of sale 
our estimate of future chargebacks is established based on our historical chargeback rates  termination provisions of the applicable contracts and industry data 
while chargeback rates vary depending on the type of contract sold  a basis point change in the estimated chargeback rates used in determining our estimates of future chargebacks would have changed our estimated reserve for chargebacks at december  by approximately million 
our estimate of chargebacks 
table of contents million as of december  is influenced by early contract termination events such as vehicle repossessions  refinancings and early pay off 
if these factors change  the resulting impact would be a change in our future estimate for chargebacks 
we believe our actual chargeback experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates 
we do not anticipate significant changes from our historical chargeback experience during goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment might have occurred 
in completing step one or our impairment analyses as of december   we used a discounted cash flow model dcf to calculate fair value 
we also analyzed our market capitalization along with potential adjustments to market capitalization such as control premium  cost synergies and non public information in evaluating our estimate of fair value 
the results of our dcf model were then compared to our adjusted market capitalization at december  to determine whether the dcf model provided an accurate measure of fair value for the purpose of the impairment test 
our estimate of fair value was then compared to our book value at december  to determine whether an indicator of impairment existed 
we believe a discounted cash flow model is the most reliable valuation method to use because the fair value of our business is dependent on our ability to generate cash through sales and service of new and used vehicles 
in the years prior to  we utilized a combination of an earnings multiple approach and a discounted cash flow approach 
we discontinued the use of the earnings multiple approach in for several reasons 
first  the earnings multiple approach only measures the value of our equity component and ignores the capital provided by debt investors  which is an important characteristic of sonic s capital structure 
secondly  an earnings multiple approach is limited by the fact it is based on historical performance and thus reflects the market s prior assessments based on conditions in prior periods 
the dcf method is based on forward looking projections that incorporate current trends and market expectations 
finally  an earnings multiple approach requires us to make assumptions regarding non public information related to the components of the earnings of the associated companies ie  understanding various charges  reserve levels  unusual gains losses  etc 
to ensure that the multiples are actually comparable 
since our book value at december  exceeded our estimated fair value  we were required to proceed to step two of the impairment analysis 
the second step involved allocating the calculated fair value to all of the assets of the reporting unit as if the calculated fair value was the purchase price in a business combination 
this allocation included assigning value to any previously unrecognized identifiable assets including franchise assets which means the remaining fair value that was allocated to goodwill was reduced 
see discussion regarding franchise agreements acquired prior to july  in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we then compared the fair value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation process to the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit with the difference representing the amount of impairment 
based on criteria established by the applicable accounting pronouncements  we have one reporting unit 
the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow model include projected earnings  weighted average cost of capital and estimates in the weighted average cost of capital inputs and residual growth rates 
to the extent the reporting unit s earnings decline significantly or there are changes in one or more of these assumptions that would result in lower valuation results  it could cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to exceed its fair value and thus require us to conduct the second step of the impairment test described above 
in projecting our reporting unit s earnings  we develop many assumptions based on our expectations 
these assumptions would include  but are not limited to  new and used vehicle unit sales  internal revenue enhancement initiatives  cost control initiatives  internal investment programs such as training and technology infrastructure and inventory floor plan borrowing rates 
our expectation of new vehicle unit sales is driven by our expectation of the industry wide seasonally adjusted annual rate saar of new vehicles 
the estimate of the industry saar in future periods is the basis of our assumptions related to new vehicle unit sales volume in our dcf model because we believe the historic and projected saar level of the saar has been a reliable indicator of sonic s 
table of contents new vehicle unit sales trends 
the level of saar assumed in our projection of earnings for was million units with a gradual increase in the level of saar to million units in  and remaining level thereafter 
our dcf model is dependent on the assumptions used and is sensitive to changes in assumptions 
for example  assuming all other factors remain the same  a change in projected earnings would change the calculated fair value estimate as of december  by approximately million 
in the event the weighted average cost of capital changed basis points  assuming all other factors remain the same  the calculated fair value estimate as of december  would change by approximately million 
finally  if the residual growth estimate changed basis points  assuming all other factors remain the same  the calculated fair value estimate as of december  would change by approximately million 
upon completion of step two of the impairment evaluation as of december   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in continuing operations as of december  since we have not finalized the valuation of certain assets and liabilities that are necessary for us to complete our step two evaluation the recorded impairment charge is an estimate 
we will report the final results of our impairment charge in our quarterly report on form q for the period ended march   with any adjustment to the estimate recorded as of december  affecting the results of the first quarter of we also recorded a goodwill impairment charge associated with franchises held for sale in discontinued operations totaling million at december  based on our estimate that goodwill associated with those franchises was not recoverable 
we continue to face a challenging automotive retail environment and an uncertain economic environment in general 
as a result of these conditions  there can be no assurances that an additional material impairment charge will not occur in a future period 
we will continue to monitor events in future periods to determine if additional asset impairment testing should be performed 
if we are required to apply the second step of the goodwill impairment test in future periods  we could be required to record an additional impairment charge to goodwill which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
we estimate the value of our franchise assets using a discounted cash flow model 
the discounted cash flow model used contains inherent uncertainties  including significant estimates and assumptions related to growth rates  projected earnings  and cost of capital 
we are subject to financial risk to the extent that our franchise assets become impaired due to deterioration of the underlying businesses 
the risk of a franchise asset impairment loss may increase to the extent the underlying businesses earnings or projected earnings decline 
franchise assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually 
as a result of our impairment testing in  we recorded franchise asset impairment charges of million at december  of this impairment charge  million was included in continuing operations and million was included in discontinued operations 
the balance of our franchise assets related to continuing operations and discontinued operations totaled million at december  insurance reserves we have various self insured and high deductible insurance programs which require us to make estimates in determining the ultimate liability we may incur for claims arising under these programs 
we accrue for insurance reserves on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on the expected year end liability 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly by our management based on available information and take into consideration annual actuarial evaluations based on historical claims experience  claims processing procedures  medical cost trends and  in certain cases  a discount factor 
if our management receives information which causes us to change our estimate of the year end liability  the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we estimate the ultimate liability under these programs is between million and million 
at december   we had million reserved for such programs 
we used a discount rate of to calculate the present value of our estimated workers compensation claims and our general liability claim 
table of contents reserves 
the biggest driver in worker s compensation and garage liability is historical and future loss experience 
we believe our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates 
lease exit accruals the majority of our dealership properties are leased under long term operating lease arrangements 
when leased properties are no longer utilized in operations  we record lease exit accruals 
these situations could include the relocation of an existing facility or the sale of a franchise where the buyer will not be subleasing the property for either the remaining term of the lease or for an amount equal to our obligation under the lease 
the lease exit accruals represent the present value of the lease payments  net of estimated sublease rentals  for the remaining life of the operating leases and other accruals necessary to satisfy lease commitments to the landlords 
at december   we had million accrued for lease exit costs 
a significant change in our assumptions regarding the time period to obtain a subtenant or the amount of the anticipated sublease income could have a material effect on our accrual and  as a result  earnings 
in addition  based on the terms and conditions negotiated in the sale of franchises in the future  additional accruals may be necessary if the purchaser of the franchise does not assume the lease of the associated franchise  or we are unable to negotiate a sublease with the buyer of the franchise on terms that are identical to or better than those associated with the original lease 
legal proceedings we are involved  and expect to continue to be involved  in numerous legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes and actions brought by governmental authorities 
as of december   we had accrued million in legal reserves 
although sonic vigorously defends itself in all legal and administrative proceedings  the outcomes of pending and future proceedings arising out of the conduct of sonic s business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes  class actions  purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities  cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on sonic s business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or prospects 
classification of franchises in continuing and discontinued operations we classify the results from operations of our continuing and discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income based on the provisions of sfas no 
many of these provisions involve judgment in determining whether a franchise will be reported as continuing or discontinued operations 
such judgments include whether a franchise will be sold or terminated  the period required to complete the disposition and the likelihood of changes to a plan for sale 
if in future periods we determine that a franchise should be either reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations or from discontinued operations to continuing operations  previously reported consolidated statements of income will be reclassified in order to reflect that classification 
during the year ended december   we identified franchises to be held for sale that were included in continuing operations in our annual report on form k dated december   and three franchises that were held for sale and included in discontinued operations in our annual report on form k dated december   that we chose to continue to hold and operate in continuing operations in income taxes as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and from time to time these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
we believe that our tax positions comply  in all material respects  with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
included in other accrued liabilities at december  is million in reserves that we have provided for these matters including 
table of contents estimates related to possible interest and penalties 
from time to time  we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty 
examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals  including consideration paid or received in connection with such transactions 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities  as well as changes in tax laws  regulations and precedent 
the effects on our financial statements of income tax uncertainties are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have million in deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and management reviews these carryforward positions  the time remaining until expiration and other opportunities to utilize these carryforwards in making an assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that these carryforwards will be utilized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million in based on our judgment that all state carryforwards will not be utilized 
however  the results of future operations  regulatory framework of these taxing authorities and other related matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
therefore  actual utilization of the losses which created these deferred tax assets which differs from the assumptions used in the development of management s judgment could occur 
additionally  due to the overall downturn in the economy of the united states and  in particular  the automotive retail industry  and the historical operating loss principally generated by the goodwill impairment charges recorded in  we recorded additional valuation allowances of million related to other certain deferred tax assets based on our judgment that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the recorded balances 
we accrue for income taxes on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on the expected year end liability 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly by our management based on available information and take into consideration estimated income taxes based on prior year income tax returns  changes in income tax law  our income tax strategies and other factors 
if our management receives information which causes us to change our estimate of the year end liability  the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our operating results  financial position and cash flows

during the year ended december   we disposed of ten franchises  and  at december   had an additional franchises or physical dealerships held for sale 
the results of operations of these dealerships  including gains or losses on disposition  have been included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented

impairments and other charges as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of december   we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of million in continuing operations 
due to a portion of the goodwill impairment being associated with entities obtained in stock purchase transactions  million of the impairment charge is not deductible for income tax purposes 
as a result  our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was negatively affected by this impairment charge 
the impairment charge recorded in discontinued operations totaled million as of december  of the total charge recorded in discontinued operations  million is not deductible for income tax purposes and  as a result  also negatively impacted the effective income tax rate related to discontinued operations for the year ended december  in addition to our goodwill impairment test  we reviewed franchise asset and property and equipment valuation 
as a result of changes in various operating initiatives  we determined that the planned use of certain leased properties or the completion of certain capital projects would not occur 
accordingly  we recorded lease exit accruals and impairment charges on construction in progress projects 
based on historical and projected operating losses for certain continuing operations dealerships  we also determined that certain dealerships would not be able to recover recorded franchise asset and property and equipment asset balances 
in addition  due to lowering the estimate of proceeds from the sale of certain dealership franchises held for sale based on current market conditions  we recorded goodwill  franchise asset and property and equipment asset impairment charges in discontinued operations 
during  we recorded an additional million in income tax valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryforwards based on our judgment that all state carryforwards will not be utilized 
additionally  due to the overall downturn in the economy of the united states and  in particular the automotive retail industry  and the historical operating losses principally generated by the goodwill impairment charges recorded in  we recorded additional valuation allowances of million related to other certain deferred tax assets based on our judgment that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the recorded balances 
in addition  during  our results of operations were negatively impacted by the effects of hurricane ike and hail storms on our stores in the houston and mid west markets 
we estimate the overall impact physical damage and business interruption on lowered pretax earnings by approximately million 
during the second quarter of  we recorded various charges in connection with the decision to exit certain facility leases and cancel various facility improvement projects  asset impairments and other asset write offs  finance chargeback reserves  litigation matters and an adjustment of certain tax strategies

new vehicle revenues are highly dependent on manufacturer incentives  which vary from cash back incentives to low interest rate financing 
new vehicle revenues are also dependent on manufacturers to provide adequate vehicle allocations to meet customer demands 
they are also highly dependent on the availability of consumer credit 
the automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
as an automotive retailer  we seek to mitigate the effects of this cyclicality by maintaining a diverse mix of branded dealerships 
our brand diversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower priced  or economy vehicles  to luxury vehicles 
for the year ended december   of our total new vehicle revenue was generated by import and luxury dealerships compared to for the automobile retail industry uses the seasonally adjusted annual rate saar as one benchmark to measure the amount of new vehicle unit sales activity within the united states market 
the saar averages below reflect a blended average of all brands sold in the united states market 
change change saar in millions of vehicles year ended december  
table of contents during  sonic  like other automotive retailers  experienced significant declines in customer traffic at its dealerships 
we believe this was caused in part by rising gas prices which caused an abrupt shift in consumer buying habits away from larger trucks and suvs to more fuel efficient passenger cars 
this shift disrupted customer traffic especially at our domestic and certain luxury branded stores 
we believe the declines in the second half of the year were also caused in part by a lack of credit availability for consumers and a general concern by consumers regarding the overall economy 
although the united states government has made various attempts to seek to ease the lack of credit availability and strengthen consumer confidence  we believe these conditions will continue well into industry expectations for the saar are currently between and million vehicles which  if realized  would be a decline of to from for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total new vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total new vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total new vehicle unit price same store total dealerships as reported our overall same store unit retail declines in tracked closely to the average industry declines 
we experienced unit declines across all of our major brands  both import and domestic 
our import dealerships experienced a decrease of  units  or  while our domestic dealerships experienced a decrease of  units  or from to these overall import and domestic same store new vehicle unit decreases can also be attributed to a decline in new truck and suv units from to of  units  or  as well as a decline in new car units of  units  or 
our most significant declines came from our cadillac and lexus brands  posting declines of and  respectively 
our import dealerships average price per new unit decreased  or  while our domestic dealerships average price per unit remained more stable  declining  or 
our new vehicle price per unit decreased primarily due to a change in sales mix to lower cost  more fuel efficient vehicles 
during  our import dealerships experienced a decrease in new unit volume of  units  or  while our domestic dealerships experienced a decrease of units  or  as compared to these overall import and domestic same store new vehicle unit decreases can be attributed to a decline in new truck and suv units from to of  units  or 
declining truck and suv sales resulted from increasing gasoline prices  a downturn in the housing market and other economic uncertainties 
the increase in our average price per unit in as compared to can be attributed mainly to a larger percentage of our sales being generated by higher priced luxury vehicles 
many of our import dealerships experienced average price per unit increases 
used vehicles used vehicle revenues are directly affected by a number of factors including the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
in addition  various manufacturers provide franchised dealers the opportunity to certify pre owned vehicles based on criteria established by the manufacturer 
this certification process extends the 
table of contents standard manufacturer warranty 
in  our sales of cpo vehicles increased to of total used vehicle units from in this percentage increase was driven in part by a decrease in our sales of non cpo used vehicles of  units or during we believe our used vehicle volume in was adversely affected by consumer confidence levels and a challenging consumer credit environment

although we saw a decline in used unit sales volume for  we were able to outperform the national average in used vehicle unit volume  with the national average declining for we believe we were able to outperform the national average due to our continued implementation of our standardized used vehicle merchandising process 
the first generation process allowed us to retail many used vehicles we historically would have disposed of through the wholesale market 
the second generation process involves physically moving certain used vehicles to specific dealerships within a particular region that have shown success in retailing the specific type of used vehicle 
we believe these processes will allow us to continue to outperform the industry even in the current challenging sales environment 
in  the overall increase when compared to can be mainly attributed to a continuing shift in our dealership mix towards more import and luxury dealerships which tend to retail higher priced used vehicles 
wholesale vehicles wholesale vehicle revenues are highly correlated with new and used vehicle retail sales and the associated trade in volume 
wholesale revenues are also significantly affected by our corporate inventory management policies  which are designed to optimize our total used vehicle inventory

table of contents during  lower wholesale vehicle revenues resulted from a decline in wholesale unit sales along with a decrease in average wholesale price per unit 
the decrease in wholesale unit volume can be primarily attributed to our increased focus on retailing used vehicles which historically we would have disposed of through the wholesale market and fewer vehicles received in trades for new and used vehicles due to declines in overall retail activity 
lower wholesale vehicle revenues realized during were driven by a decline in wholesale unit sales coupled with a decrease in average wholesale price per unit 
the decrease in unit volume can be primarily attributed to our increased focus on retail used vehicles see used vehicles above 
the wholesale price per unit decrease can also be attributed to the merchandising process 
this process allowed us to retail vehicles that historically would have had a positive effect on our wholesale per unit price 
parts  service and collision repair fixed operations parts and service revenue consists of customer requested repairs customer pay  warranty repairs  retail parts  wholesale parts and collision repairs 
parts and service revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs  available service capacity  vehicle quality  customer loyalty and manufacturer warranty programs 
same store revenue from these items was as follows amounts in thousands for the year ended change change for the year ended change change parts service collision repair same store we believe that over time  vehicle quality will improve  but vehicle complexity will offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality 
we also believe that over the long term we have the ability to continue to add service capacity and increase revenues 
however  based on current market conditions  we do not anticipate a near term increase in additional service capacity 
manufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty coverage 
these factors  over the long term  combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on cpo vehicles see the discussion in business business strategy certified pre owned vehicles above  should facilitate long term growth in our service and parts business 
barriers to long term growth may include reductions in the rate paid by manufacturers to dealers for warranty work performed 
as of december   we operated collision repair centers 
collision revenues are heavily impacted by trends in the automotive insurance industry

warranty sales at our import dealerships declined million  or  as compared to our mercedes dealerships continued to experience significant decreases in warranty sales  declining million  or  as compared to  due to continued improvements in vehicle quality and changes in their vehicle warranty programs

in connection with vehicle financing  service contracts  other aftermarket products and insurance contracts  we receive commissions from the providers for originating contracts 
rate spread is another term for the commission earned by our dealerships for arranging vehicle financing for consumers 
the amount of the commission could be zero  a flat fee or an actual spread between the interest rate charged to the consumer and the interest rate provided by the direct financing source bank  credit union or manufacturers captive finance company 
we have established caps on the potential rate spread our dealerships can earn with all finance sources 
we believe the rate spread we earn for arranging financing represents value to the consumer in numerous ways  including the following lower cost  below market financing is often available only from the manufacturers captives and franchised dealers  lease financing alternatives are largely available only from manufacturers captives or other indirect lenders  customers with substandard credit frequently do not have direct access to potential sources of sub prime financing  and customers with significant negative equity in their current vehicle ie  the customer s current vehicle is worth less than the balance of their vehicle loan or lease obligation frequently are unable to pay off the loan on their current vehicle and finance the purchase or lease of a replacement new or used vehicle without the assistance of a franchised dealer 
finance  insurance and other revenues are driven by the level of new and used vehicle unit sales  manufacturer financing or leasing incentives and our f i penetration rate 
the f i penetration rate represents the percentage of vehicle sales on which we are able to originate financing or sell extended service contracts  other aftermarket products or insurance contracts 
our finance and extended service contract penetration rates were relatively flat when comparing to we realized an increase in our maintenance contract penetration rate from in to in we have an opportunity for our f i penetration rate to increase over time as we continue to emphasize the use of menu selling techniques 
finance penetration rates may come under pressure in in the event manufacturers offer attractive financing rates from their captive finance affiliates since we tend to earn lower commissions under these programs

gross profit and gross margins our overall gross profit and gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenues generally vary depending on changes in our revenue mix 
although sales of new vehicles comprise the majority of our total revenues  new vehicles generally carry the lowest margin rate of any product or service we offer 
as a result  sales of new vehicles comprise a relatively small portion of total gross profits 
retail sales of used vehicles generally carry a slightly higher gross margin rate than new vehicles 
parts  service and collision repair carry a much higher gross margin rate than vehicle sales 
brand mix also has an impact on the gross margins that we realize 
historically  our import and luxury brands generally provide higher overall gross profits and gross margins than our domestic brands due to a stronger parts and service business 
our same store revenue mix is shown in the following table for the year ended basis point change for the year ended basis point change revenues as a percentage of total revenues new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles fixed operations finance  insurance and other same store for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total gross profit in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported 
table of contents the overall gross margin rates on our various revenue lines on a same store basis were as follows for the year ended basis point change for the year ended basis point change new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles parts  service and collision repair finance and insurance overall gross margin the basis point decrease in the new vehicle gross margin can be attributed to weakening economic and market conditions as well as a shift toward lower cost vehicles 
gross margin rates for used vehicles declined in compared to primarily due to sourcing more vehicles through wholesale auctions versus trades  actively managing our vehicle days supply to offer more favorable pricing to customers  and a shift in demand to more certified pre owned vehicles  which typically generate lower margin rates 
gross margin rates for parts  service and collision repair in declined compared to primarily due to a higher proportion of the sales being comprised of lower margin activities such as standard oil changes and tire sales and a proportionately lower amount of sales being comprised of higher margin business such as significant repair and maintenance work 
we believe customers are choosing to forgo or delay significant repair and maintenance work due to the current economic environment 
our same store gross margin percentage was relatively flat in  when compared to gross margin improvements experienced in fixed operations were offset by declines in new  used and wholesale vehicle gross margin percentages 
our mercedes dealerships posted the most significant increase in fixed operations gross margin percentage among our import dealerships  improving by basis points 
in addition  the majority of our domestic dealerships contributed to the fixed operations increase 
specifically  our gm excluding cadillac and cadillac dealerships experienced fixed operations margin increases of basis points and basis points  respectively  when compared to selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised of four major groups compensation expense  advertising expense  rent and rent related expense  and other expense 
compensation expense primarily relates to dealership personnel who are paid a commission or a modest salary plus commission which typically vary depending on gross profits realized and support personnel who are paid a fixed salary 
due to the salary component for certain dealership and corporate personnel  gross profits and compensation expense are not correlated 
advertising expense and other expenses vary based on the level of actual or anticipated business activity and number of dealerships owned 
rent and rent related expense typically varies with the number of dealerships owned  investments made for facility improvements and interest rates 
although not completely correlated  we believe the best way to measure sg a expenses is as a percentage of gross profit 
compared to total sg a expenses increased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of gross profit  reported sg a expenses increased from in to in both the dollar increase and the increase as a percentage of gross profit are primarily attributed to current year acquisitions  hail and hurricane damage  loss on marketable securities  lease exit charges and legal expenses incurred in in  total reported compensation expense decreased by million  or  when compared to as a percentage of gross profit  total compensation expense increased to in from in the unfavorable increase as a percentage of gross profit was primarily the result of overall declines in gross profit due to the slow sales environment 

table of contents advertising expense decreased million  or  in  as compared to as a percentage of gross profit  advertising expense remained flat at in both and total advertising costs were lower versus prior year due to adjustments in advertising strategies in response to the soft operating environment 
rent and rent related expenses increased million  or  in  compared to acquisitions contributed million of the overall increase 
rent and rent related expenses were also negatively impacted by lease exit charges recorded in discussed under the previous heading impairments and other charges 
as a percentage of gross profit  rent and rent related expenses increased to in from in other sg a expenses increased million  or  in  as compared to  primarily due to the lease exit charges discussed in the previous heading impairments and other charges  in addition to increases in service loaner expense  hail and hurricane damage and loss on marketable securities 
compared to in  total sg a expenses increased million  or  compared to as a percentage of gross profit  reported sg a expense decreased by basis points  from in to in the increase in absolute dollars includes million from acquisitions 
the decrease as a percentage of gross profit is primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume and a resulting gross profit increase of million  or  from to total reported compensation expense increased million  or  in  as compared to due to acquisitions and higher gross profit levels 
however  as a percentage of gross profit  total compensation expense improved by basis points to in from in in  advertising expense increased million  or  remaining flat as a percentage of gross profit when compared to approximately million of the increase in was related to acquisitions and the remaining increase is attributed to our targeted approach to allocate advertising dollars to certain brands in key markets

in addition  we experienced rent increases as a result of the completion of facility improvement projects and the resulting sale leaseback of these facilities and the effect of rising interest rates on our variable rate leases 
other sg a expenses increased million  or  in  as compared to  primarily as a result of a million increase from acquisitions and a million increase in service loaner expense and a million increase in outside services 
impairment charges impairment charges increased million from to due to impairment charges recorded in related to goodwill  franchise assets and fixed assets as a result of the adverse change in general business climate and a decline in our anticipated future cash flows 
of the total increase  million  or  was related to an estimated goodwill impairment charge recorded as of december  in continuing operations in association with our goodwill impairment test 
based on the results of our step one test we were required to complete step two of the impairment evaluation 
the goodwill impairment charge at december  is an estimate because we had not finalized the valuation of certain assets and liabilities that are necessary for us to complete our step two evaluation

at the beginning of  we had five separate interest rate swaps that effectively converted a portion of our fixed rate debt to libor based variable rate debt the variable swaps 
the variable swaps required us to pay a variable rate equal to the fixed six month libor rate which was fixed on february and august of each year plus a spread ranging from to with a weighted average spread of

as such  we expect interest expense to increase in subsequent years 
see further discussion related to refinancing under the subsequent heading liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents other income expense  net the increase in other income of million as compared to is primarily due to the repurchase of million of our convertible notes in open market transactions  which resulted in a gain of million 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations was in  in and in the tax rate for is lower than prior years primarily because a large portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in is not deductible for tax purposes  the application of a valuation allowance on the remaining deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards and additional valuation allowances recorded on other deferred tax asset balances based on our evaluation that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion of the recorded deferred tax asset balances 
absent these events our effective tax rate generally varies from year to year based on the distribution of taxable income between states in which we operate 
we expect the effective tax rate in future periods to fall within a range of to 
discontinued operations the pre tax income losses from operations and the sale of discontinued franchises were as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands income from operations gain loss on disposal of franchises lease exit charges property impairment charges goodwill impairment charges franchise agreement and other asset impairment charges favorable lease asset impairment charges pre tax income loss total revenues due to the adverse change in the general business climate in and our plan to generate liquidity through asset sales  we added dealerships to assets held for sale and lowered our estimate of the expected proceeds from the sale of certain dealerships previously held for sale 
as a result  we recorded goodwill  franchise agreement and other asset and property and equipment impairment charges 
in addition  we recorded lease exit charges in connection with our decision to cease using several dealership properties which are leased under operating leases 
for the year ended december   we recorded property and franchise agreement impairment charges based upon changes in estimated expected proceeds for certain dealerships classified as held for sale during the year 
lease exit charges were recorded as a result of our decision to exit certain facility leases 
during the year ended december   we recorded lease exit charges  asset impairment charges and other asset write offs in connection with our decision to exit certain facility leases and cancel various facility improvement projects 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we require cash to finance acquisitions and fund debt service and working capital requirements 
we rely on cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  real estate mortgage financing  asset sales and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements 
our liquidity could be negatively affected if we fail to comply with the financial covenants in our existing debt or lease arrangements 
because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries  the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flows and ability to service debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash based on their ability to generate cash 
uncertainties in the economic environment have severely and negatively affected our overall liquidity 
in  our liquidity was negatively affected by the downturn in the overall economy and particularly the severe downturn experienced in the automotive retail industry 
in the latter half of  the saar seasonally adjusted annual rate of new vehicle sales was at a level not experienced in the last twenty years with the saar rate at million units in october  million units in november and million units in december the annual average saar since was million units and the annual saar for the years and were million units and million units  respectively 
industry expectations for the saar are currently between and million units 
this would represent a further decline of to from the saar 
we are currently faced with substantial amounts of our debt maturing or becoming payable between may and november these obligations include our convertible notes  our convertible notes and amounts outstanding related to our credit facility 
the amounts outstanding at december   related to these different debt issues were million principal related to our convertible notes  million under our revolving credit sub facility and associated new and used floor plan borrowings which totaled million and million principal of our convertible notes 
the lack of credit availability resulting from the financial services industry crisis has also hindered our ability to obtain additional debt financing to refinance our existing indebtedness 
certain industry analysts believe it is possible for current conditions to continue through the latter part of without any noticeable improvement and for recovery to begin in early due to lack of credit availability in the debt markets  sonic has retained the services of a financial advisory firm to assist us in evaluating alternatives to address our and debt obligations 
we believe the ultimate resolution of these near term debt obligations could result in higher interest rates  the issuance of equity to holders of the convertible notes and the convertible notes as part of the refinancing plan and modifications to the debt on terms less favorable to us than our existing debt instruments 
we may also have to sell equity or higher cost debt or dealerships which are not currently held for sale or which we might not otherwise sell in different circumstances 
we do not have any agreement yet with holders of our and obligations to restructure these obligations and cannot predict or provide assurance we will obtain such agreement 
we will likely need consent from our senior secured lenders to restructure the and debt obligations 
cash flows provided by our dealerships are derived from various sources 
the primary sources include individual consumers  automobile manufacturers  automobile manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries and finance companies 
disruptions in these cash flows can have a material and adverse impact on our operations and overall liquidity 
long term debt and credit facilities credit facility our syndicated credit facility is comprised of financial institutions  including five manufacturer affiliated finance companies providing for up to billion in revolving credit and floor plan financing

a withdrawal of this pledge by sonic financial corporation sfc  who holds the  shares of common stock of speedway motorsports  inc  or a significant decline in the value of speedway motorsports  inc common stock could reduce the amount we can borrow under the revolving credit sub facility 
at december   these shares contributed million to our borrowing base compared to million at december  the borrowing base was approximately million at december  the amount available to be borrowed under our revolving credit sub facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative face amount of any outstanding letters of credit

the collateral for the credit facility also includes the pledge of the stock or equity interests of our dealership franchise subsidiaries  except where such a pledge is prohibited by the applicable vehicle manufacturer 
we agreed under the credit facility not to pledge any assets to any third party  subject to certain stated exceptions  including floor plan financing arrangements 
in addition  the credit facility contains certain negative covenants  including covenants which could restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends  capital expenditures and material dispositions of assets as well as other customary covenants and default provisions 
specifically  the credit facility permits cash dividends on our class a and class b common stock so long as no event of default or unmatured default as defined in the credit facility has occurred and is continuing and provided that  after giving effect to the payment of a dividend  we remain in compliance with other terms and conditions of the credit facility 
the credit facility contains events of default  including cross defaults to other material indebtedness  change of control events and events of default customary for syndicated commercial credit facilities 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts under the credit facility 
on march   we executed an amendment to the credit facility which resulted in no default arising by virtue of the going concern explanatory paragraph our independent registered public accounting firm included in its audit report for our consolidated financial statements through may  in connection with the amendment  we agreed to increase the interest rates for amounts outstanding and the quarterly commitment fees payable by us on the unused portion

there were also certain other concessions we provided to the lenders under the credit facility in connection with the amendment 
we agreed to limit our borrowing under the credit facility to ordinary course of business expenditures  and in any event  not for the repayment of certain indebtedness  including the convertible notes  the convertible notes and the notes 
in addition  we are prohibited from making any acquisitions and we agreed that net proceeds from certain asset sales until may  would be used to permanently reduce the amount available under the revolving credit sub facility 
we anticipate having to further amend or refinance the credit facility during in connection with restructuring the convertible notes and in anticipation of the february maturity date of the credit facility 
to the extent the current economic conditions continue  the interest rates  borrowing capacity and other terms of a new credit agreement may be less favorable than those terms that currently exist

see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding these conversion conditions 
also see off balance sheet arrangements subsequent heading also within this item for a discussion regarding the off balance sheet aspects of this financing and the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
none of the conversion features on the convertible notes were triggered in notes payable to a finance company three notes payable totaling million in aggregate principal were assumed with the purchase of certain dealerships during the second quarter of the assumed notes 
the assumed notes bear interest rates from to with a weighted average of  have a combined monthly principal and interest payment of million  mature november  through september  and are collateralized by letters 
table of contents of credit 
we recorded the assumed notes at fair value using an interest rate of 
although the assumed notes allow for prepayment  the penalties and fees are disproportionately burdensome relative to the assumed notes principal balance 
therefore  we do not currently intend to prepay the assumed notes 
mortgage notes in  we began to adjust our strategy on ownership of dealership properties and began to mortgage properties we own rather than finance them using sale leaseback transactions 
we expect this trend to continue in the future  thereby reducing the frequency of future sale leaseback transactions 
prior to  we sought to minimize the ownership of real property in order to preserve capital to fund our acquisition strategy 
during  we paid million to purchase existing dealership properties which were previously financed through long term operating leases 
we obtained mortgage financing of million to fund the purchase of these previously leased dealership properties 
in addition  we obtained million and million in mortgage financing on newly completed dealership facilities in and  respectfully 
since beginning this strategy of owning more of our dealership properties in late  we have added million in mortgage financing to our capital structure on ten of our dealership properties 
these mortgage notes require monthly payments of principal and interest through maturity and are secured by the underlying properties 
maturity dates range between june and september the weighted average interest rate was at december  proceeds received were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit sub facility 
floor plan facilities we finance all of our new and certain of our used vehicle inventory through standardized floor plan facilities which are due on demand 
these floor plan facilities bear interest at variable rates based on libor and prime 
the weighted average interest rate for our floor plan facilities was for and for we receive floor plan assistance from certain manufacturers 
floor plan assistance received is capitalized in inventory and charged against cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold 
we received approximately million and million in and  respectively  and recognized approximately million and million in and  respectively  in manufacturer assistance 
interest payments under each of our floor plan facilities are due monthly and we are generally not required to make principal repayments prior to the sale of the vehicles 
covenants and default provisions our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its audit report on our consolidated financial statements that indicated there is an uncertainty that we will remain in compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements and that this uncertainty raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the issuance of a going concern explanatory paragraph by our independent registered public accounting firm would  by itself  violate a separate covenant of our credit facility 
on march   we executed an amendment to the credit facility which resulted in no default arising by virtue of the going concern explanatory paragraph through may  and  as a result  we are in compliance with the covenants in the credit facility as of the date of this filing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate an extension of the amendment beyond may  in addition  on march   we amended a guaranty and subordination agreement with the landlord of many of our facility leases 
this amendment adjusted the calculation of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio contained in the original guaranty and subordination agreement and added two additional financial covenants  a consolidated liquidity ratio covenant and a consolidated total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio covenant 
we continue to explore options related to our debt obligations with the assistance of our financial advisor 
we are currently in discussions with our senior secured lenders to amend our credit facility to  among 
table of contents other things  avoid potential defaults under that facility and permit the restructuring of our other outstanding debt obligations 
if we are unable to restructure our debt obligations  we may not have funds available to repay the million principal amount of our convertible notes that mature on may  if we do not refinance or repay the convertible notes on or before may   we will be in default under our credit facility and other material indebtedness  including our convertible notes and our notes 
in addition  absent further amendments to our credit facility  we may violate the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in our credit facility as of the quarter ending june  and be in default of the terms of that facility  which would otherwise mature in february finally  we are evaluating restructuring options for million principal amount outstanding of convertible notes that we may be required to repurchase at the option of the holders on november  although we will attempt to restructure these debt obligations to avoid events of default under one or more of these arrangements  we cannot assure our investors that we will succeed in these efforts 
a default under one or more of our debt arrangements  including the credit facility  could cause cross defaults of other debt  lease facilities and operating agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and operations and raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to restructure these upcoming debt maturities  we may not be able to continue our operations  and we may be unable to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection and or have an involuntary bankruptcy case filed against us 
noncompliance with covenants  including a failure to make any payment when due  under our credit facility  floor plan facilities  operating lease agreements  notes  convertible notes and convertible notes collectively  our material debt agreements could result in a default and an acceleration of our repayment obligation under our credit facility 
a default under our credit facility would constitute a default under our floor plan facilities and could entitle these lenders to accelerate our repayment obligations under the one or more of the floor plan facilities 
a default under our credit facility and one or more floor plan facilities would not result in a default under our notes  convertible notes or convertible notes unless our repayment obligations under the credit facility and or one or more of the floor plan facilities were accelerated 
an acceleration of our repayment obligation under any of our material debt agreements could result in an acceleration of our repayment obligations under our other material debt agreements 
the failure to repay principal amounts of the material debt agreements when due would create cross default situations related to other indebtedness 
the credit facility includes the following financial covenants covenant required december  actual consolidated liquidity ratio consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio consolidated total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio in addition  many of our facility leases are governed by guarantee agreements between the landlord and us that contain financial and operating covenants 
the financial covenants are identical to those under the credit facility with the exception of one financial covenant related to the ratio of ebtdar to rent with a required ratio of no less than to at december   the ratio was to we were in compliance with all of the restrictive and financial covenants on all of our floor plan  long term debt facilities and lease agreements as of december  to the extent the current economic conditions result in decreased profitability  our senior secured debt increases  including borrowing under our revolving credit sub facility  or the availability under our revolving credit sub facility which is a component of our consolidated liquidity ratio declines significantly or we need to borrow for other purposes  it is possible that we could violate one or more of these covenants in the future or be restricted from borrowing amounts we need to fund our operations and capital requirements 

table of contents acquisitions and dispositions in the past a significant portion of our cash flow was used to fund dealership acquisitions 
following is a summary of acquisition activity in recent years year of acquisition subsequent year revenues cash portion of purchase price net of cash acquired in millions a a revenues are estimated during  we acquired or were awarded five franchises for a combined purchase price of million in cash  net of cash acquired 
the cash utilized for these acquisitions was financed by cash generated from our existing operations and by borrowings under our credit facility 
although the pricing on dealership acquisitions may improve in due to the economic downturn  we do not currently anticipate any dealership acquisitions in in an effort to preserve liquidity for our upcoming debt maturities 
during  we disposed of ten franchises 
these disposals generated cash of million 
in addition  as of december   we had additional franchises at physical dealerships held for sale 
assets to be disposed of in connection with franchises not yet sold have been classified in assets held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures include the purchase of land  construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers  building improvements and equipment purchased for use in our dealerships 
we selectively construct new dealership facilities to maintain compliance with manufacturer s image requirements 
we often finance these projects first through new mortgages and secondly through cash flow from operations and availability from our revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures in were approximately million 
of this amount  million was related to the buy out of long term operating leases on existing facilities  million was related to facility construction projects and million was for equipment utilized in our dealership operations 
of this million  million was financed through new mortgages and was funded through operations and use of our revolving credit facility 
see the previous discussion in this section under the heading mortgage notes 
as of december   commitments for facilities construction projects totaled approximately million 
we expect investments related to capital expenditures to be reduced to minimum levels in we do not anticipate significant refurbishment projects of dealership properties to occur beyond those already underway at the end of stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase shares of our class a common stock or redeem securities convertible into class a common stock 
we use our share repurchase authorization to offset dilution caused by the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock awards and to maintain our desired capital structure 
at the beginning of  our remaining repurchase authorization was approximately million 
during  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of class a common stock or securities convertible into class a common stock 
during  we repurchased  shares for approximately million  with million occurring during the first quarter ended march  at that time we believed that it was in our best interest to expend capital to repurchase outstanding shares of our class a common stock 
subsequently  due to current economic conditions and liquidity concerns we have curtailed our stock repurchase activities and do not anticipate significant activity during as of december   we had million remaining under our board authorization 

table of contents our share repurchase activity is subject to the business judgment of management and our board of directors  taking into consideration our historical and projected results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital requirements  covenant compliance and economic and other factors considered relevant 
these factors are considered each quarter and will be scrutinized as management and our board of directors determines our share repurchase policy throughout dividends our board of directors approved four quarterly cash dividends totaling per share during the payment of any future dividend is subject to the business judgment of our board of directors  taking into consideration our historic and projected results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital requirements  covenant compliance  share repurchases  current economic environment and other factors considered relevant

see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of restrictions on the payment of dividends 
subsequent to december   our board of directors indefinitely suspended our recurring quarterly dividend program 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  we arrange our inventory floor plan financing through both manufacturer captive finance companies and a syndicate of captive finance companies and commercial banks 
generally  our floor plan financed with manufacturer captives is recorded as trade floor plan liabilities with the resulting change being reflected as an operating cash flow 
our dealerships that obtain floor plan financing from a syndicate of captive finance companies and commercial banks record their obligation as non trade floor plan liabilities with the resulting change being reflected as a financing cash flow 
due to the presentation differences for changes in trade floor plan and non trade floor plan in the statement of cash flows  decisions made by us to move dealership floor plan financing arrangements from one finance source to another which may require the approval of the syndicate of captive finance companies and commercial banks may cause significant variations in operating and financing cash flows without affecting our overall liquidity  working capital  or cash flow 
during  general motors corporation sold a controlling interest in its finance subsidiary  general motors acceptance corporation gmac  resulting in our floor plan note payable balance with gmac being presented as non trade floor plan beginning in the year ended december  although the effect of this sale had no overall impact on our cash flows  cash from operating activities were negatively impacted as the balance of notes payable floor plan trade borrowings declined and the balance of notes payable floor plan non trade  which affects cash flows from financing activities  increased 
if our floor plan liabilities with gmac had been considered non trade floor plan in the years prior to  our statement of cash flows would have changed as follows amounts in thousands as reported effect of gmac change pro forma cash flows used in operating activities cash flows provided by investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities net increase in cash 
table of contents net cash used in combined trade and non trade floor plan financing was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by combined trade and non trade floor plan financing was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we began to finance used vehicle inventory through our floor plan facilities for the first time  which accounted for million of the million provided by combined trade and non trade floor plan financing 
differences in cash flows from floor plan financing are related to changes in inventory balances and the timing of floor plan payoffs related to year end transactions 
during  reductions of accounts receivable generated cash of million 
a combination of a high volume new vehicle sales month in december and a low volume new vehicle sales month in december resulted in the reduction in receivables 
during the third quarter of  we generated cash of approximately million from the sale of a portion of cornerstone s notes receivable to a third party 
this inflow of cash is included in cash flows from operating activities  change in receivables  in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  this transaction resulted in no material gains or losses 
the proceeds from the sale were used to repurchase our common stock and pay down our credit facility 
cornerstone s outstanding notes receivable at december  were million  net of an allowance for credit losses of million 
during the third quarter of  we sold the remaining assets of cornerstone and included million in proceeds in cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities during  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the majority of the investing activities cash outflow is related to dealership acquisitions and capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds received from dealership dispositions and the sales of property and equipment 
dealership acquisitions  net of cash acquired  used million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
due to our near term debt maturities and the lack of available financing due to the current disruption in the credit markets  we do not expect to complete any significant acquisitions in the significant components of capital expenditures relate primarily to dealership renovations and the purchase of our existing dealership facilities which had previously been financed under long term operating leases 
in connection with the shift in management s strategy to own  rather than lease  more of our dealership properties  during  we spent million to purchase several previously leased dealership properties 
these purchases were partially funded by proceeds from mortgage financing see cash flows from financing activities below in the amount of million and the remainder through borrowings under our revolving credit sub facility 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flow used in financing activities is comprised primarily of dividends paid to shareholders and our share repurchase activity 
in addition  during the years ended december  and  proceeds from long term debt amounted to million and million  respectively 
the proceeds from long term debt were obtained from mortgage financing on four dealership properties 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million of our convertible notes in open market transactions 
see our previous discussion under cash flows from operating activities regarding the combined cash flow impact of trade and non trade floor plan financing 
cash flows from discontinued operations our consolidated statement of cash flows includes both continuing and discontinued operations 
net cash used in operating activities associated with discontinued operations for the year ended december  was approximately million and was substantially comprised of changes in assets and liabilities that relate to dealership operations  including non cash asset impairment charges of approximately million 
in our consolidated statement of cash flows  cash flows from investing activities includes the line item proceeds from sale of franchises which is entirely related to 
table of contents discontinued operations 
with the exception of proceeds from sale of franchises in the amount of million and net payments on notes payable floor plan non trade in the amount of million  cash flows from investing and financing activities contain an immaterial amount of cash flows from discontinued operations 
guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the operation and disposition of dealership franchises  we have entered into various guarantees and indemnifications 
when we sell dealership franchises  we attempt to assign any related lease to the buyer of the franchise to eliminate any future liability 
however  if we are unable to assign the related leases to the buyer  we will attempt to sublease the leased properties to the buyer at a rate equal to the terms of the original leases 
in the event we are unable to sublease the properties to the buyer with terms at least equal to our lease  we may be required to record lease exit accruals 
at december   our future gross minimum lease payments related to properties subleased to buyers of sold franchises totaled approximately million 
future sublease payments expected to be received related to these lease payments were million at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding lease accruals  guarantees and indemnifications

future liquidity outlook although it is our intention to restructure or refinance the indebtedness related to near term debt obligations to avoid an event of default and to amend our credit facility to permit such restructuring or refinancing if necessary  we can give no assurances that we will be successful in our restructuring or refinancing activities 
a default under the credit facility or our other indebtedness could also cause cross defaults of other debt  lease facilities and operating agreements  all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and operations and raise substantial doubt about sonic s ability to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to restructure or refinance these upcoming debt obligations  we may not be able to continue our operations and we may be unable to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection and or have an involuntary bankruptcy case filed against us 
in accordance with applicable financial reporting requirements  as a result of the uncertainty related to our compliance with the covenants under our credit facility for the fiscal year  we have classified certain of our indebtedness as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  due to the cross default provisions governing our other indebtedness 
our future contractual obligations  taking into consideration the current classification of all of our outstanding long term debt  are as follows see notes and below for amounts for each year based on stated maturities and associated interest costs of those balances for the years stated below based on stated maturities amounts in thousands thereafter total floor plan facilities long term debt letters of credit estimated interest payments on floor plan facilities estimated interest payments on long term debt operating leases net of sublease rentals construction contracts other purchase obligations fin liability total floor plan facilities include amounts classified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale 

table of contents absent a restructuring of the amounts due under the convertible subordinated notes  we believe we will be in default under the terms of the credit facility 
the lenders associated with the credit facility have the ability to accelerate payment of amounts due under the terms of that agreement 
this acceleration will cause cross defaults under the terms of our other indebtedness which will also allow the holders of our other indebtedness to accelerate payments of outstanding principal 
accordingly  we have classified all of our indebtedness as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  the classification of all of our debt as current is reflected in the amounts in the table above 
in the event the holders of our debt did not have the ability to accelerate payment the scheduled maturities for the periods above      and thereafter would have been million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
floor plan facilities balances including amounts classified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale are correlated with the amount of vehicle inventory and are generally due at the time that a vehicle is sold 
estimated interest payments were calculated using the december  floor plan facilities balance  the weighted average interest rate for the fourth quarter of of and the assumption that floor plan facilities balances at december  would be relieved within sixty days in connection with the sale of the associated vehicle inventory 
in the event the holders of our debt did not the ability to accelerate payment on scheduled maturities as described in footnote  the estimated interest payments for the periods     and thereafter would have been million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
other purchase obligations include contracts for office supplies  utilities  and various other items or services 
amount represents recorded liability  including interest and penalties  related to fin see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe our best source of liquidity for operations and debt service remains cash flows generated from operations combined with our availability of borrowings under our floor plan facilities or any replacements thereof  our credit facility  selected dealership and other asset sales and our ability to raise funds in the capital markets  though it will be difficult to raise funds in the capital markets in the near term 
currently  we may only use the proceeds from borrowings for ordinary course of business expenditures 
continued uncertainties in the economic environment  the lack of availability of consumer credit  and uncertainty regarding the domestic automotive manufacturers will affect our ability to generate cash from operations as well as our ability to raise funds in the capital markets 
because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries  the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flows and ability to service debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash based on their ability to generate cash 
uncertainties in the economic environment have severely and negatively affected our overall liquidity in and we expect the conditions that existed at the end of to continue through therefore  we expect cash flows generated through operations in to be lower than those generated through operations in we will attempt to mitigate the impact of declines in cash flow from operations by limiting acquisitions  increasing asset sales  reducing capital expenditures  reducing or eliminating share repurchases and suspending our dividend 
due to the lack of liquidity in the capital markets  we have retained the services of a financial advisory firm to assist us in evaluating alternatives to address our and debt obligations 
we believe the ultimate resolution of these near term debt obligations could result in higher interest rates and other terms less favorable to us than our existing debt instruments 
we continue to explore options related to our debt obligations with the assistance of our financial advisor 
we are currently in discussions with our senior secured lenders to amend our credit facility to  among other things  avoid potential defaults under that facility and permit the restructuring of our other outstanding debt obligations 
if we are unable to restructure our debt obligations  we may not have funds available to repay the million principal amount of our convertible notes that mature on may  if we do not refinance or repay the convertible notes on or before may   we will be in default under our credit facility and other material indebtedness  including our convertible notes and our notes 
in addition  absent further amendments to our credit facility  we 
table of contents may violate the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in our credit facility as of the quarter ending june  and be in default of the terms of that facility  which would otherwise mature in february this default could occur due to the payment of the convertible notes being considered a fixed charge in the denominator of the fixed charge coverage ratio calculation  or the generation of lower ebitda due to reduced earnings as a result of the current operating environment 
finally  we are evaluating restructuring options for million principal amount outstanding of convertible notes that we may be required to repurchase at the option of the holders on november  although we will attempt to restructure these debt obligations to avoid events of default under one or more of these arrangements  we cannot assure our investors that we will succeed in these efforts 
a default under one or more of our debt arrangements  including the credit facility  could cause cross defaults of other debt  lease facilities and operating agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and operations and raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to restructure these upcoming debt maturities  we may not be able to continue our operations  and we may be unable to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection and or have an involuntary bankruptcy case filed against us 
on march   we executed an amendment to the credit facility which resulted in no default arising by virtue of the going concern explanatory paragraph our independent registered public accounting firm included in its audit report for our consolidated financial statements through may  in connection with the amendment  we agreed to higher pricing terms and other concessions to the lenders 
see liquidity and capital resources long term debt and credit facilities credit facility 
we anticipate having to further amend or refinance the credit facility during in connection with restructuring the convertible notes and in anticipation of the february maturity date of the credit facility 
to the extent the current economic conditions continue  the interest rates  borrowing capacity and other terms of a new credit agreement may be less favorable than those terms that currently exist 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first and fourth quarters generally contribute less operating profits than the second and third quarters 
weather conditions  the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers cause seasonality in  and may adversely affect vehicle demand and  as a result  our profitability 
parts and service demand remains more stable throughout the year 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the operation and disposition of dealership franchises  we have entered into various guarantees and indemnifications 
we expect the aggregate amount of the obligations we guarantee to increase as we dispose of additional franchises 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding these guarantees and indemnifications 
past performance under these guarantees and indemnifications and their estimated fair value has been immaterial to our liquidity and capital resources 
although we seek to mitigate our exposure in connection with these matters  these guarantees and indemnifications  including environmental exposures and the financial performance of lease assignees and sub lessees  cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources

since the holders of the convertible notes can force us to repurchase these notes on november   and we can redeem these notes at our option on or after november   we expect that either a conversion  repurchase or a redemption of these notes will occur in this type of financing arrangement was selected by us in order to achieve a more favorable interest rate as opposed to other forms of available financing 
the convertible notes are material to our liquidity and capital resources 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes we entered into convertible hedge and warrant transactions 
the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are designed to increase the effective conversion price per share of our class a common stock from to and  therefore  mitigate the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes at the time of conversion

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our variable rate floor plan facilities  revolving credit facility borrowings and other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates 
the total outstanding balance of such variable instruments after considering the effect of our interest rate swaps see below was approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  a change of basis points in the underlying interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately million in and approximately million in of the total change in interest expense  approximately million in and approximately million in would have resulted from the floor plan facilities 
in addition to our variable rate debt  as of december  approximately in of our dealership lease facilities have monthly lease payments that fluctuate based on libor interest rates 
a change in interest rates of basis points would have had an estimated impact on rent expense of approximately million in and approximately million in we had five separate interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts totaling million collectively  the variable swaps to effectively convert a portion of our fixed rate debt under the notes to a libor based variable rate debt 
under the variable swaps  we received on the respective notional amounts and paid interest payments on the respective notional amounts at a rate equal to the six month libor which is fixed on february and august of each year plus a spread ranging from to with a weighted average spread of 
all the variable swaps were settled in 
table of contents we also have interest rate swap agreements collectively  the fixed swaps to effectively convert a portion of its libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
under the terms of the fixed swaps interest rates reset monthly 
the fair value of these swap positions at december  was a liability of million 
we will receive and pay interest based on the following notional pay rate receive rate maturing date in millions one month libor may  one month libor june  one month libor june  one month libor july  one month libor july  one month libor september  one month libor september  one month libor october  one month libor december  one month libor august  one month libor july  the one month libor rate was at december  subsequent to december   we settled our million notional  pay and million notional  pay swaps above with a payment to the counterparty for approximately million 
absent the acceleration of payments of principal that may result from non compliance with financial and operational covenants under our various indebtedness future maturities of variable and fixed rate debt  and related interest rate swaps are as follows thereafter total fair value liabilities amounts in thousands  except for interest rates long term debt fixed rate average stated interest rate variable rate average stated interest rate variable to fixed average pay rate receive rate one month libor one month libor one month libor one month libor one month libor one month libor one month libor foreign currency risk in common with other automotive retailers  we purchase certain of our new vehicle and parts inventories from foreign manufacturers 
although we purchase our inventories in us dollars  our business is subject to foreign exchange rate risk which may influence automobile manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the united states 
to the extent that we cannot recapture this volatility in prices charged to customers or if this volatility negatively impacts consumer demand for our products  this volatility could adversely affect our future operating results
