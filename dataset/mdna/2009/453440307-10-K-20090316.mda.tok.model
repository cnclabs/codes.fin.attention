ihc does not sell health products for the senior market 
with respect to ihc s life and disability business  madison national lif e has historically sold almost all of this business through one distribution source specializing in serving school districts and municipalities 
in  ihc successfully began to diversify the marketing of these products through other channels  including its health insurance distribution  and expects to build upon this success in while management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning and decision making  underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as the primary goal in all decisions as to whether or not to increase our retention in a core line  expand into new products  acquire an entity or a block of business  or otherwise change our business model 
management s assessment of trends in healthcare and morbidity  with respect to medical stop loss  fully insured medical  disability and dbl  mortality rates with respect to life insurance  and changes in market conditions in general play a significant role in determining the rates charged  deductibles and attachment points quoted  and the percentage of business retained 
the company believes that the acquisition of amc has further enabled it to make these assessments 
ihc also seeks transactions that permit it to leverage its vertically integrated organizational structu re by generating fee income from production and administrative operating companies as well as risk income for its carriers and profit commissions

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies and practices is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis 
insurance premium revenue recognition and policy charges life traditional life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits  primarily term and whole life insurance products 
premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when due 
annuities and interest sensitive life contracts  such as universal life and interest sensitive whole life  are contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed 
premiums from these policies are reported as funds on deposit 
policy charges consist of fees assessed against the policyholder for cost of insurance mortality risk  policy administration and early surrender 
these revenues are recognized when assessed against the policyholder account balance 
policies that do not subject the company to significant risk arising from mortality or morbidity are considered investment contracts 
deposits received from such contracts are reported as other policyholder funds 
policy charges for investment contracts consist of fees assessed against the policyholder account for maintenance  administration and surrender of the policy prior to contractually specified dates  and are recognized when assessed against the policyholder account balance 
health premiums for short duration medical insurance contracts are intended to cover expected claim costs resulting from insured events that occur during a fixed period of short duration 
the company has the ability to cancel the annual contract or to revise the premium rates at the beginning of each annual contract period to cover future insured events 
insurance premiums from annual health contracts are collected monthly and are recognized as revenue evenly as insurance protection is provided 
premiums related to long term and short term disability contracts are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term 
insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  where material  including legal  other fees  and costs not associated with specific claims but related to the claims payment function for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these loss reserves are based on actuarial assumptions and are maintained at levels that are in accordance with gaap 
the company s estimate of loss reserves represents management s best estimate of the company s liability at the balance sheet date 
loss reserves differ for short duration and long duration insurance policies  including annuities 
reserves are based on approved actuarial methods  but necessarily include assumptions about expenses  mortality  morbidity  lapse rates and future yield on related investments 
all of the company s short duration contracts are generated from its accident and health business  and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
management believes that the company s methods of estimating the liabilities for insurance reserves provided appropriate levels of reserves at december  changes in the company s reserve estimates are recorded through a charge or credit to its earnings 
life for traditional life insurance products  the company computes insurance reserves primarily using the net premium method based on anticipated investment yield  mortality  and withdrawals 
these methods are widely used in the life insurance industry to estimate the liabilities for insurance reserves 
inherent in these calculations are management and actuarial judgments and estimates that could significantly impact the ending reserve liabilities and  consequently  operating results 
actual results may differ  and these estimates are subject to interpretation and change 
policyholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products  such as universal life  interest sensitive life and annuities 
policyholder funds are comprised primarily of deposits received and interest credited to the benefit of the policyholder less surrenders and withdrawals  mortality charges and administrative expenses 
interest credited interest credited to policyholder funds represents interest accrued or paid on interest sensitive life policies and investment policies 
amounts charged to operations including interest credited and benefit claims incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances are reported as insurance benefits  claims and reserves life and annuity 
credit rates for certain annuities and interest sensitive life policies are adjusted periodically by the company to reflect current market conditions  subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates 
health the company believes that its recorded insurance reserves are reasonable and adequate to satisfy its ultimate liability 
the company primarily uses its own loss development experience  but will also supplement that with data from its outside actuaries  reinsurers and industry loss experience as warranted 
to illustrate the impact that loss ratios have on the company s loss reserves and related expenses  each hypothetical change in the loss ratio for the health business ie  the ratio of insurance benefits  claims and settlement expenses to earned health premiums for the year ended december   would increase reserves in the case of a higher ratio or decrease reserves in the case of a lower ratio by approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
dependi ng on the circumstances surrounding a change in the loss ratio  other pre tax amounts reported in the consolidated statement of operations could also be affected  such as amortization of deferred acquisition costs and commission expense 
the company s health reserves by segment are as follows in thousands december  claim policy total health reserves claims reserves medical stop loss fully insured health group disability individual accident and health and other december  claim policy total health reserves claims reserves medical stop loss fully insured health group disability individual accident and health and other medical stop loss the company s medical stop loss segment is comprised of employer stop loss  hmo reinsurance and provider excess 
all of the company s medical stop loss policies are short duration and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims or open claims from prior periods  including losses incurred for claims that have not been reported ibnr 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
the two primary assumptions underlying the calculation of loss reserves for medical stop loss business are i projected net loss ratio  and ii claim development patterns 
the projected net loss ratio is set at expected levels consistent with the underlying assumptions projected net loss ratio 
claim development patterns are set quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history claim development patterns 
the company uses the projected net loss ratio to establish reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
the company has concluded that a reasonably likely change in the projected net loss ratio assumption could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liqui dity material effect but a reasonably likely change in the claim development pattern would not have a material effect 
projected net loss ratio generally  during the first twelve months of an underwriting year  reserves for medical stop loss are first set at the projected net loss ratio  which is set using assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward 
the projected net loss ratio is the company s best estimate of future performance until such time as developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results 
while the company establishes a best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  actual experience may deviate from this estimate 
this was the case with the  and underwriting years which deviated by  and net loss ratio points  respectively 
after the recorded reserve increase  it is reasonably likely that the actual experience will fall within a range up to five net loss ratio points above or below the expected projected net loss ratio for at december  the impact of these reasonably likely changes at december   would be an increase in net reserves in the case of a higher ratio or a decrease in net reserves in the case of a lower ratio of up to approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop loss relate to i frequency and severity of claims  ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols  and iii the adherence by the mgus that produce and administer this business to the company s underwriting guidelines 
changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio as discussed above 
claim development patterns subsequent to the first twelve months of an underwriting year  the company s developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate losses 
at this point  claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
development factors based on historical patterns are applied to paid and reported claims to estimate fully developed claims 
claim development patterns are reviewed quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history 
the company must determine whether changes in development represent true indications of emerging experience or are simply due to random claim fluctuations 
the company also establishes its best estimates of claim development factors to be applied to more developed treaty year experience 
while these factors are based on historical claim development patterns  actual claim development may vary from these estimates 
the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its actual claim development patterns would have a material effect 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is more complex than fully insured medical and disability business due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
the level of these deductibles makes it more difficult to predict the amount and payment pattern of such claims 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims  whereas fluctuations in aggregate coverage are largely attributable to frequency of underlying claims rather than severity 
liabilities for first dollar medical reserves and disability coverages are computed using completion factors and expected net loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies or deficiencies will typically emerge during the course of the following year rather than over a number of years 
for employer stop loss  as noted above  the company maintains its reserves based on underlying assumptions until it determines that an adjustment is appropriate based on emerging experience from all of its mgus for prior underwriting years 
reserves for hmo reinsurance and provider excess are adjusted on a policy by policy basis 
because of the small number of hmo reinsurance and provider excess policies it writes  the company is able to evaluate each policy individually for potential liability by reviewing open claims with each hmo or provider group and applying completion factors using historical data 
fully insured health reserves for fully insured medical and dental business are established using historical claim development patterns 
claim development by number of months elapsed from the incurred month is studied each month and development factors are calculated 
these claim development factors are then applied to the amount of claims paid to date for each incurred month to estimate fully complete claims 
the difference between fully complete claims and the claims paid to date is the estimated reserve 
total reserves are the sum of the reserves for all incurred months 
the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured reserves is that historical claim development patterns tend to be representative of future claim development patterns 
factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures  changes in product design  changes in time delay in submission of claims  and the incidence of unusually large claims 
the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications  the potential impacts of any changes in these factors are minimal 
the time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility 
since our analysis considered a variety of outcomes related to these factors  the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect 
group disability the company s group disability segment is comprised of long term disability ltd and disability benefits law dbl 
the two primary assumptions on which group disability reserves are based are i morbidity levels  and ii recovery rates 
if morbidity levels increase  for example due to an epidemic or a recessionary environment  the company would increase reserves because there would be more new claims than expected 
in regard to the assumed recovery rate  if disabled lives recover more quickly than anticipated then the existing claims reserves would be reduced  if less quickly  the existing claims reserves would be increased 
advancements in medical treatments could affect future recovery  termination  and mortality rates 
with respect to ltd only  other assumptions are i changes in market interest rates  ii changes in offsets  iii advancements in medic al treatments  and iv cost of living 
changes in market interest rates could change reserve assumptions since the payout period could be as long as years 
changes in offsets such as social security benefits  retirement plans and state disability plans also impact reserving 
as a result of the forgoing assumptions  it is possible that the historical trend may not be an accurate predictor of the future development of the block 
as with most long term insurance reserves that require judgment  the reserving process is subject to uncertainty and volatility and fluctuations may not be indicative of the claim development overall 
while the company believes that larger variations are possible  the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its primary assumptions would have a material effect 
individual accident and health and other this segment is a combination of closed lines of business as well as certain small existing lines 
while the assumptions used in setting reserves vary between these different lines of business  the assumptions would generally relate to the following i the rate of disability  ii the morbidity rates on specific diseases  and iii accident rates 
the reported reserves are based on management s best estimate for each line within this segment 
general uncertainties that surround all insurance reserving methodologies would apply 
however  since the company has so few policies of this type  volatility may occur due to the small number of claims 
deferred acquisition costs costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring insurance policies and investment type contracts are deferred and recorded as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
these costs are principally broker fees  agent commissions  and the purchase prices of acquired blocks of business 
dac is amortized to expense and reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
all dac within a particular product type is amortized on the same basis using the following methods life for traditional life insurance and other premium paying policies accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amortization of dac is charged to expense over the related premium revenue recognition period 
assumptions used in the amortization of dac are determined based upon the conditions as of the date of policy issue or assumption and are not generally revised during the life of the policy 
for long duration type contracts accounted for under sfas no 
 such as annuities and universal life business  amortization of dac is charged to expense over the life of the book of such contracts based on the present value of the estimated gross profits egps expected to be realized over the life of the book of contracts 
egps consist of margins based on expected mortality rates  persistency rates  interest rate spreads  and other revenues and expenses 
the company regularly evaluates its egps to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
if the company determines that the current assumptions underlying the egps are no longer the best estimate for the future due to changes in actual versus expected mortality rates  persistency rates  interest rate spreads  or other revenues and expenses  the future egps are updated using the new assumptions and prospective unlocking occurs 
these updated egps are utilized for future amortization calculations 
the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted through a current charge or credit to the consolidated statement of operations 
health for credit health insurance policies accounted for under sfas no 
 amortization of dac is charged to expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
investments the company accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company has classified all of its investments as available for sale or trading securities 
these investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in either accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets for available for sale securities or as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations for trading securities 
fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
premiums and discounts on debt securities purchased at other than par value are amortized and accreted  respectively  to interest income in the consolidated statements of operations  using the constant yield method ove r the period to maturity 
net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
declines in value of securities available for sale that are judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as realized losses 
the factors considered by management in determining when a decline is other than temporary include but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies  subordinated credit support  whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments  current expected cash flows  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions including  in the case of fixed maturities  t he effect of changes in market interest rates  and the company s intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value 
for structured securities  such as mortgage backed securities  an impairment loss is recognized when there has been a decrease in expected cash flows and or a decline in the security s fair value below cost 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill related to the company s equity method investment in amic is considered in the evaluation of whether there has been an other than temporary decline in value of the overall investment in amic 
all other goodwill carrying amounts are evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  further evaluation is required to determine if a write down of goodwill is required 
other intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing 
any impairment write down of goodwill and other intangible assets would be charged to expense 
no impairment charge was required in  or if we experience a sustained decline in our results of operations and cash flows  or other indicators of impairment exist  we may incur a material non cash charge to earnings relating t o impairment of our goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our results 
deferred income taxes the provision for deferred income taxes is based on the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to temporary differences between amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recognized for the portion of deferred tax assets that  in management s judgment  is not likely to be realized 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company has certain tax planning strategies that were used in determining that a valuation allowance was not necessary on its deferred taxes

net realized investment gains losses net realized investment gains losses decreased million to a net loss of million in from a net gain of million in these amounts include gains and losses from sales of fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale  as well as trading securities and other investments 
decisions to sell securities are based on management s ongoing evaluation of investment opportunities and economic and market conditions  thus creating fluctuations in gains and losses from period to period

in addition  the company has recently become aware of certain activities engaged in by the non affiliate broker dealer that managed the trading accounts of the company 
the company reduced the value of the assets held in such accounts to their estimated recoverable amounts 
as a result  the company recorded a million pre tax loss  net of expected recoveries  in the fourth quarter of related to such accounts 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information about net realized investment gains and losses 
fee income and other income fee income decreased million to million from million in  primarily due to a decrease in administrative fees in the fully insured health segment primarily as a result of decreases in gross premiums from the short term medical and small group lines of business 
total other income decreased 
million to million from million in  primarily due to adjustments in in settlement of a reinsurance agreement 
insurance benefits  claims and reserves benefits  claims and reserves decreased million 
the decrease is mainly due to i a decrease of million in the medical stop loss segment  primarily resulting from a million charge  before income taxes  in for reserve strengthening  as described in further detail in the results of operations for the year ended december   ii a decrease of million in the group disability  life  annuities and dbl segment primarily due to decreases in the dbl million and group term life million lines due to improved loss ratios and claims experience offset by an increase in the ltd line million due to increased retention and higher loss ratios  offset by iii a 
million increase in the fully insured health segment  primarily due to the increases in dental million and student accident million lines which correspond to premium growth  offset by decreases in the small group million and short term medical million lines due to lower volumes of business and improved loss ratios  and iv a million increase in the individual life  annuities and other segment primarily as a result of the acquisition of a block of life and annuity business 
amortization of deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased 
million in compared to partially as a result of the acquisition of a block of life and annuity policies in the second quarter of interest expense on debt interest expense decreased 
million primarily as a result of a lower average outstanding principal balance under a line of credit during compared to combined with lower variable interest rates on the junior subordinated debt securities in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to the increase is primarily due to i a million increase in commission and administrative expenses associated with the operation of the fully insured health segment  primarily due to a increases in commission and administrative expenses for the dental million and student accident million lines due to increased volume  b increase of million primarily in commission expenses in the small group line due to higher profit commissions on business  offset by c a decrease of 
million in short term medical expenses due to lower production  and d a decrease of million primarily from administrative expenses at the third party administrators due in part to cost reductions  ii a million increase in commission and administration expenses in the individual life  annuities and othe r segment as a result of increased volume from the recent acquisition of a block of life and annuity policies  iii a million increase in the group disability  life  annuities and dbl segment primarily due to the increase in retention of the ltd business  and iv a million decrease in corporate overhead expenses primarily employee benefits  audit expenses  interest income on accrued income tax refunds and a higher allocation of expenses to the subsidiaries 
income taxes income tax expense decreased million resulting in a tax benefit of million for from an expense of

equity income from amic equity income from amic in was comparable to fee income and other income fee income increased million to million from million in  primarily due to an increase in administrative fees in the fully insured health segment including an increase of million earned by iac acquired january  in addition to million of fees earned by ihc health solutions  inc acquired january  and amc acquired april  
total other income increased million to million from million in  primarily due to adjustments in in settlement of a reinsurance agreement 
insurance benefits  claims and reserves benefits  claims and reserves increased million 
the increase is mainly due to i an increase of million in the medical stop loss segment  primarily resulting from an increase in claims experience and reserve strengthening of million related to business and million due to an increase in the projected net loss ratio on business  as described in further detail below  and the remainder  as a result of the increase in assumed premiums  and ii an increase of million in the fully insured health segment  primarily due to the increase in volume and adverse development of million related to the year  as described below in reserve strengthening 
reserve strengthening medical stop loss in accordance with our reserving methodology  the company initially establishes its medical stop loss reserves based on its best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  which is set based on underlying assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward projected net loss ratio 
this use of projections reflects the fact that actual claims on medical stop loss cases typically are not fully reported until after the end of the policy period 
we use the projected net loss ratio to set reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
ihc s typical practice is to then increase or decrease claims reserves once we know the actual claims experience 
we then review quarterly the projected net loss ratios and claim development patterns as we develop reserve estimates based on recent claim develop ment history claim development patterns 
medical stop loss business is excess coverage with a short duration 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is especially complicated due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies and deficiencies will typically emerge during the following year rather than over a number of years 
consistent with our experience  the industry as a whole has succumbed to the pricing pressures caused by an unexpectedly long down cycle or soft market for medical stop loss business 
the medical stop loss market has been soft for the past four years  including cases written in and  which means that many of the company s competitors have been willing to write business at little or no margin 
we had been aware of these market conditions and had curtailed our growth in order to attempt to achieve higher profit margins 
the company believed that it had taken sufficient action to insure that business written in would produce better margins than that written in and formulated a projected net loss ratio reflecting such expectations 
as is typical with medical stop loss business  mgus do have some discretion with in our underwriting guidelines to make pricing concess ions on certain cases  particularly as it relates to maintaining their core renewal business and production sources 
in the third quarter of  during our quarterly review of claim development patterns  we identified a material increase in claims and reserves with respect to business written in such adverse development was primarily driven by the frequency of claims relative to the business written in that year proving significantly higher than what would have been predicted by prior loss development patterns 
this increased frequency of medical stop loss claims was due  in part  to increased severity of primary claims 
the company determined that this increase in claims was an indication of a pattern of higher loss frequency 
while claims related to business written in have not yet developed to a level where claim development patterns would provide reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels  we determined that it was appropriate to re estimate the projected net loss ratio to take into account developing losses with respect to business written in as a result of these actions  the company increased the projected net loss ratio on the business written in by and increased the net loss ratio defined as insurance benefits  claims and reserves divided by premiums earned less underwriting expenses on the business written in by 
this resulted in a charge of million  before income taxes  in primarily relating to the re estimation of unpaid losses from the prior year 
in addition  the company booked higher reserves of million related to the business due to the increase of in the projected net loss ratio from the rate at which new business was reserved for in the company recorded net loss ratios for the medical stop loss line of  and for the years ended december   and respectively 
the net loss ratio equation primarily differs from the combined ratio in that it subtracts out expenses from the premiums prior to dividing by the insurance benefits  claims and reserves 
we primarily use net loss ratios from a reserving standpoint and as a management tool to measure the profitability of medical stop loss with respect to each program 
the company primarily uses combined ratios as an accounting measurement for reporting purposes 
fully insured health the adverse development recorded in in the fully insured health segment was largely related to i overestimating the value of certain new initiatives started in that were intended to manage and reduce claims costs  including medical care management services to insureds  negotiation of out of network claims  and auditing provider bills cost containment program  and ii underestimating in the seasonality patterns that are a result of an increasing portion of the business having high deductible health plans hdhps 
although this cost containment program did have a positive impact on the results of the small group major medical line  during the company determined that the impact was not as large as it had anticipated when setting reserves in with respect to the seasonality patterns  hdhps have fewer claims in the first quarter of a plan year and higher claims in the last quarter of the plan year 
primarily as a result of these two factors during  the company believed that its small group major medical business had significantly better loss ratios than we later determined 
amortization of deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased 
million 
interest expense on debt interest expense increased 
million primarily as a result of a higher average outstanding principal balance and a higher interest rate paid under a line of credit during compared to an average of in compared to in 
selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to the increase is primarily due to i a million increase in commission and administrative expenses associated with the operation of the fully insured segment  primarily due to a from the acquisitions of cam and amc  b an overall increase in costs of million due to the increase in business reported as sga expenses  previously described  and c a million increase in amortization expenses as a result of the purchase accounting for recent acquisitions  and ii a million increase in commissions and other general expenses in the medical stop loss segment due to higher volume 
income taxes income tax expense decreased million to 
million for from million in  primarily due to the decrease in pre tax income in the decrease in the effective tax rate to in from in is primarily due to a higher ratio of dividend received deductions drd and tax exempt income to pre tax income in compared to although the amount of drd and tax exempt income has not increased substantially  their proportion to pre tax income has due to the decrease in operating income in resulting in a lower effective tax rate in liquidity insurance group the insurance group normally provides cash flow from i operations  ii the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed maturities  and iii earnings on investments 
such cash flow is partially used to fund liabilities for insurance policy benefits 
these liabilities represent long term and short term obligations 
corporate corporate derives its funds principally from i dividends from the insurance group  ii management fees from its subsidiaries  and iii investment income from corporate liquidity 
regulatory constraints historically have not affected the company s consolidated liquidity  although state insurance laws have provisions relating to the ability of the parent company to use cash generated by the insurance group 
cash flows as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents compared with as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily offset by an increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell of million 
total investments  net of amounts due to and from brokers  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was million 
net cash used by operating activities of discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million primarily due to cash used for the settlement of the credit life and disability segment 
net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was million primarily as a result of net purchases of million of fixed maturities and million of securities under resale and repurchase agreements  partially offset by million in net proceeds on sales of equity securities in addition to million received in connection with the acquisition of a block of life insurance and annuity policies 
the company has million of insurance reserves that it expects to ultimately pay out of current assets and cash flows from future business 
if necessary  the company could utilize the cash received from maturities and repayments of its fixed maturity investments if the timing of claim payments associated with the company s insurance resources does not coincide with future cash flows 
for the year ended december   cash received from the maturities and other repayments of fixed maturities was million 
the company believes it has sufficient cash to meet its currently anticipated business requirements over the next twelve months including working capital requirements and capital investments 
balance sheet total investments  net of amounts due to and from brokers  decreased million during largely due to i a million increase in unrealized losses on available for sale securities  ii million of losses realized for other than temporary impairments  iii million of other net trading account losses  iv a million decrease in partnership investments  v offset by million of net purchases of short term investments  resale agreements  and fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale 
the company had net receivables from reinsurers of million at december  substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration 
all of such receivables are either due from highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary at december  other assets increased million primarily due to a million increase in net deferred tax assets recorded as a result of a million net loss and million of net unrealized losses on investment securities allocated to stockholders equity 
the million decrease in total stockholders equity in is primarily due to a net loss of million and a million increase in after tax net unrealized losses on investments 
asset quality and investment impairments the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations  which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
of the aggregate carrying value of the insurance group s cash and investment assets  approximately was invested in investment grade fixed maturities  resale agreements  policy loans and cash and cash equivalents at december  the company s gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities totaled million at december  also at such date  approximately of the insurance group s fixed maturities were investment grade and continues to be rated on average aa 
the company marks all of its available for sale securities to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
these investments tend to carry less default risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed matur ity investments 
at december   approximately 
or million of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in diversified non investment grade fixed maturities investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greater risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
the company has only one non performing fixed maturity at december  with a carrying value of 
million  or 
of the total carrying value of fixed maturities 
at december   the company had million invested in whole loan collateralized mortgage obligations cmos backed by alt a mortgages 
of this amount  were in cmos that originated in or earlier and were in cmos that originated in while these mortgages have seen lower market values recently  we believe that the unrealized losses on these securities are not necessarily indicative of their ultimate performance 
the company s mortgage security portfolio has no direct exposure to sub prime mortgages 
the decline in fair value for the equity securities was primarily due to wider spreads for preferred stocks issued by financial institutions following the disruption in credit markets 
some of these financial institutions have exposure to sub prime mortgages 
the unrealized loss for cmo securities is primarily attributable to alt a mortgages as described ab ove 
the unrealized losses on corporate securities and state and political subdivision securities are due to wider spreads 
spreads have widened as investors shifted funds to us treasuries in response to the current market turmoil 
the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments  as discussed in note f vi of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
for the years ended december  and the company recorded losses of million and 
million  respectively  for other than temporary impairments 
the following table summarizes the carrying value of securities with fair values less than of their amortized cost at december  by the length of time the fair values of those securities were below of their amortized cost in thousands greater than greater than months  months  less than less than less than greater than months months months months total fixed maturities equity securities total the unrealized losses on all remaining available for sale securities have been evaluated in accordance with the company s impairment policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at december  in  the company experienced an increase in net unrealized losses of million which  net of deferred tax benefits of million and net of deferred policy acquisition costs of million  decreased stockholders equity by million reflecting net unrealized losses of million at december  compared to net unrealized losses of million at december  
from time to time  as warranted  the company may employ investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
further deterioration in credit quality of the companies backing the securities  further deterioration in the condition of the financial services industry  a continuation of the current imbalances i n liquidity that exist in the marketplace  a continuation or worsening of the current economic recession  or additional declines in real estate values may further affect the fair value of these securities and increase the potential that certain unrealized losses be designated as other than temporary in future periods and the company may incur additional write downs 
health reserves the following table summarizes the prior year net unfavorable amount incurred in according to the year to which it relates  together with the opening reserve balance net of reinsurance recoverable to which it relates in thousands reserves at prior year amount january  incurred in total reserves and prior total the following sections describe  for each segment  the deficiency unfavorable development or redundancy favorable development experienced in  together with the key assumptions and changes therein affecting the reserve estimates 
medical stop loss the company experienced net unfavorable development of million in the medical stop loss segment primarily related to million of negative development on the reserves 
with respect to the reserves  the deficiency was the result of on going analysis of recent loss development trends with respect to primarily attributable to the increased frequency of claims and the severity of primary claims 
in the third quarter of  the company identified a material increase in claims and reserves with respect to business written in such adverse development was primarily driven by the frequency of claims relative to the business written in that year proving significantly higher than what would have been predicted by prior loss development patterns 
this increased frequency of medical stop loss claims was due  in part  to increased severity of primary claims 
fully insured health the company experienced million of favorable development in the fully insured health segment primarily related to million on the business 
the favorable development in the fully insured health segment in is related to overestimating the seasonality patterns of the business having hdhps in group disability the group disability segment had an unfavorable development of 
million 
this amount consists of a favorable development of million on the reserves primarily due to dbl and a net unfavorable development of million for all other years due to ltd 
due to the long term nature of ltd  in establishing loss reserves the company must make estimates for case reserves  incurred but not reported reserves ibnr  and reserves for loss adjustment expenses lae 
case reserves generally equal the company s best estimate of the present value of the liability for future benefits to be paid on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the lae reserve is calculated based on an actuarial expense study 
since the ltd block of policies is relatively small  results can vary from year to year solely on the basis of one or two policies 
it is not uncommon for a reserve of several hundred thousand dollars to be associated with one policy 
if a small number of claimants with large policy reserves were to recover or a few large claims were incurred  the results could distort the company s reserve estim ates from year to year 
however  there were no individual factors in that caused the unfavorable development in ltd 
with respect to dbl  reserves for the most recent quarter of earned premium are established using a net loss ratio methodology 
the net loss ratio is determined by applying the completed prior four quarters of historical net loss ratios to the last quarter of earned premium 
reserves associated with the premium earned prior to the last quarter are established using a completion factor methodology 
the completion factors are developed using the historical payment patterns for dbl 
the favorable development in the dbl line is due to lower than expected claims 
there were normal fluctuations to the company s experience factor 
the ibnr factors were updated to reflect the current experience 
the reserving process used by management was consistent from to individual accident and health and other the individual accident and health and other segment had favorable development of 
million 
the company experienced 
million favorable variance related to reserves on our blanket accident and sickness product that is sold to volunteer fire districts  due to lower claims experience than historically experienced 
the company had 
million favorable variance on all other individual a h lines related to and prior reserves 
the reserving process used by management was consistent from to capital resources due to its strong capital ratios  broad licensing and excellent asset quality and credit worthiness  the insurance group remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
in november  december and march  the company borrowed million  million and million  respectively  through pooled trust preferred issuances by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts 
in august  the company entered into a million line of credit  all of which was drawn down at that time 
at december   million remains outstanding du e to scheduled reductions of million in this line of credit in both august and see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
ihc enters into a variety of contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of its operations  including liabilities for insurance reserves  funds on deposit  debt and operating lease obligations 
however  ihc does not believe that its cash flow requirements can be fully assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  also will vary based upon ihc s future needs 
although some outflows are fixed  others depend on future events 
the chart below reflects the maturity distribution of ihc s contractual obligations at december  in thousands junior funds subordinated interest insurance on debt debt on debt leases reserves deposit total and thereafter totals outlook for  ihc s business plan is to i continue to maintain the profitability of our fully insured health business  while selectively pursuing new opportunities that leverage our vertically integrated strategy of generating fee income at multiple levels of marketing and administration  as well as risk profit and profit commission income  ii expand the distribution and continue to improve the profitability of our medical stop loss business  iii proactively adjust our mix of business to take advantage of market conditions  and iv continue to expand the distribution of our life and disability products 
ihc believes it will be successful in mitigating any impact from proposed federal health care reform legislation  if enacted  as well as the impact of the current economic downturn because of our reliance on controlled distribution and our mix of business 
the following summarizes what ihc has accomplish ed and the outlook for and beyond by segment 
historic core lines of business ihc has historically been a life and health insurance holding company for two insurance companies  standard security life insurance company of new york standard security life and madison national life insurance company  inc madison national life  which relied on independent general agents  managing general underwriters mgus and administrators to perform the majority of all marketing  underwriting  claims and administrative functions for our two primary product segments medical stop loss and group disability  life  annuities and dbl 
while it is always our intent to emphasize underwriting profits and not top line growth  the medical stop loss industry as a whole succumbed to pricing pressures caused by an unexpectedly long down cycle or soft market from through as a consequence of these market conditions  we made a decision to curtail our growth and our loss ratios are improved 
due to stricter underwriting guidelines and the termination of several mgus in  we expect a decline in stop loss premiums in the company expects its gross group life and disability premiums to increase in as a result of taking over an estimated million block from an insurer that exited the market  of which we will retain approximately 
with respect to distribution  standard security life is approved to write medical stop loss in all states and madison national life in states 
standard security life is currently contacted to write this product through nine mgus  and madison national life through one 
t he company has a significant ownership interest in five of these mgus including those owned by amic  which produced million of medical stop loss premium s written on ihc paper in 
fully insured health segment the fully insured health market estimated at billion in the us is a much larger market than the medical stop loss market estimated at billion 
the company limited the amount of its growth in this segment in and expects to continue to do so in in the event we determine to accelerate our growth  we are optimistic that as a result of its multiple product filings  distribution sources  and the sheer size of the market our fully insured health business could grow while maintaining profitable underwriting results 
investments due to the continued turmoil in the capital markets  ihc  like many insurance and other companies in the financial sector  recognized a loss in for other than temporary impairments 
these impairments were realized on certain investments in preferred stocks and fixed maturities primarily alt a mortgage securities 
these preferred stocks were investment grade preferred stocks issued by well known financial institutions and account for approximately of our total investment portfolio 
our fixed maturity portfolio continues to be rated on average aa  and the company considers all unrealized losses in this category to be temporary 
we have no direct investments in sub prime mortgages  although approximately of our total investment portfolio is alt a mortgages 
while these mortgages have seen lower market values recently  we believe that the unrealized losses on these securities are not necessarily indicative of their ultimate performance 
our book value per share decreased to at december  from at december  due to a net loss and changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
to the extent that the capital markets remain unsettled  we may continue to see volatility in the market price of our equity and fixed maturity securities  which could have a negative impact on our net income and book value per share 
summary in summary  the company anticipates improved operating performance in as a result of i increased profitability from its multiple f ully i nsured h ealth p roducts through varied distribution channels  ii continuing improvement in the profitability of its medical stop loss business  and iii reduced susceptibility to market cycles due to a better balance in our fully insured health business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain an investment portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities 
options may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets 
the following summarizes the estimated pre tax change in fair value based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the us treasury yield curve of the fixed income portfolio assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at december  estimated estimated change change in interest rates fair value in fair value in millions basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline the company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the insurance group will not be adversely affected by its current investments 
this monitoring includes the maintenance of an asset liability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows 
this is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the company s in force policies using current assumptions on mortality  lapses and expenses 
then  current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns 
the results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows 
additionally  various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions 
these scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates in relation to the business of the insurance group 
in the company s analysis of the asset liability model  a to basis point change in interest rates on the insurance group s liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to its liabilities  if interest rates were to increase  the risk to the company is that policies would be surrendered and assets would need to be sold 
this is not a material exposure to the company since a large portion of the insurance group s interest sensitive policies are burial policies that are not subject to the typical surrender patterns of other interest sensitive policies  and many of the insurance group s universal life and annuity policies were acquired from liquidated companies which tend to exhibit lower surrender rates than such policies of continuing companies 
additionally  there are charges to help offset the benefits being surrendered 
if interest rates were to decrease substant ially  the risk to the company is that some of its investment assets would be subject to early redemption 
this is not a material exposure because the company would have additional unrealized gains in its investment portfolio to help offset the future reduction of investment income 
with respect to its investments  the company employs from time to time as warranted investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures
