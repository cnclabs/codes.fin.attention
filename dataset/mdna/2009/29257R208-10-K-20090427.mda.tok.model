table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a clinical research organization that engages in the design and management of complex clinical trials for the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
our mission is to provide our clients with high quality  full service support for their clinical trials 
we offer therapeutic expertise  experienced team management and advanced technologies 
our headquarters is in wayne  pennsylvania and our international operations are based in espoo  finland 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
we anticipate that will meet our cash requirements through march of  assuming we are able to fully implement our current costs cutting initiatives  we are able to win additional contracts during fiscal and we are able to maintain our current customer contracts 
in the event we are unable to do so  we will be required to obtain additional capital from external sources or significantly reduce our operating costs  which may include the cessation of operations in some countries 
net revenue is derived principally from the design  management and monitoring of clinical research studies 
clinical research service contracts generally have terms ranging from several months to several years 
a portion of the contract fee is generally payable upon execution of the contract  with the balance payable in installments over the life of the contract 
several of our older contracts contain payment schedules that are weighted towards the later stages of the contract 
the majority of our net revenue is recognized from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance basis 
to measure the performance  we compare actual direct costs incurred to estimated total contract direct costs  which we believe is the best indicator of the performance of the contract obligations as the costs relate to the labor hours incurred to perform the service 
contracts generally may be terminated by clients immediately or with short notice 
clinical trials may be terminated or delayed for several reasons including  among others  unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to the drug  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the drug  budget constraints of clients or decisions by the client to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial  development efforts on a particular drug or our failure to properly perform our obligations 
depending on the size of the trial in question  a client s decision to terminate or delay a trial in which we participate could have a material and adverse effect on our backlog  future revenue and results from operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its judgments and estimates 
management bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents revenue recognition the majority of our net revenue is recognized from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance method based on assumptions regarding the estimated completion of the project 
this method is used because management considers total costs incurred to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
works is also performed under time and material contracts whereby we recognize revenue as hours are worked based on the hourly billing rate for each contract 
each month costs are accumulated on each project and compared to total estimated cost to complete to determine the degree of completion for that particular project 
this determines the percentage of completion for the project 
this percentage of completion is multiplied by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
as the work progresses  original estimates may be adjusted due to revisions in the scope of work or other factors and a contract modification may be negotiated with the customer to cover additional costs 
our accounting policy for recognizing revenue for changes in scope is to recognize revenue when the company has reached agreement with the client  the services pursuant to the change in scope have been performed  the price has been set forth in the change of scope document and collectibility is reasonably assured based on our course of dealings with the client 
we bear the risk of cost overruns on work performed absent a signed contract modification 
because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs  it is reasonably possible that the cost estimates used will change in the near term and may have a material adverse impact on our financial performance 
in the past  we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects resulting in lower gross margins on those projects 
we may experience similar situations in the future although our current contracts in process are of a shorter duration and subject to less cost volatility 
should our estimated costs on fixed price contracts prove to be low in comparison to actual costs  future margins could be reduced  absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification 
there are no standard billing and payment provisions which are present in each contract 
each contract has separate and distinct billing and payment terms which are the result of negotiation between us an the client 
billings and the related payment terms from fixed price contracts are generally determined by provisions in the contract that may include certain payment schedules and the submission of required billing detail 
the payment schedule in the contract reflects the value of services to be performed by us at the initiation of the contract 
the payment schedule may include the value of certain interim service components as well as periodic payments which are reasonably assured at the start of the contract and which we expect to receive during the duration of the contract 
accordingly  cash receipts  including the receipt of up front payments  periodic payments and payments related to the achievement of certain billing mechanisms  do not necessarily correspond to cost incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
a contract s payment structure typically requires an upfront payment of to of the contract value at or shortly after the initiation of the contract  a series of periodic payments over the life of the contract and payments based upon the achievement of certain billing mechanisms 
the upfront payments are deferred and recognized as revenues and services are performed under the proportional performance method 
periodic payments  including payments related to the achievement of certain billing mechanisms in the contract  are invoiced pursuant to the terms of the contract once the agreed upon services criteria have been achieved 
payments based upon interim billing mechanisms are included in the value of the contract because we expect to receive them during the term of the contract 
all payments received pursuant to the contract are recognized in accordance with the proportional performance method 
in a comprehensive full service drug development program  the client would not generally purchase certain service components separately but as an integrated  full service arrangement in connection with the development of the drug 
clients generally may terminate a contract on short notice which might cause unplanned periods of excess capacity and reduced revenues and earnings 
client initiated delays or cancellations for ongoing clinical trials can come suddenly and may not be foreseeable 
to offset the effects of early termination of significant contracts  we attempt to negotiate the payment of an early termination fee as part of the original contract 
generally  we have 
table of contents not been successful in negotiating such fees 
our contracts typically require payment to us of expenses incurred to wind down a study and fees earned to date 
therefore  revenue recognized prior to cancellation does not require a significant adjustment upon cancellation 
if we determine that a loss will result from the performance of a fixed price contract  the entire amount of the estimated loss is charged against income in the period in which such determination is made 
our accounting policy for recognizing revenue for terminated projects requires us to perform a reconciliation of study activities versus the activities set forth in the contract 
we negotiate with the client  pursuant to the terms of the existing contract  regarding the wind up of existing study activities in order to clarify which services the client wants us to perform 
once we and the client agree on the reconciliation of study activities and the agreed upon services have been performed by us  we would record the additional revenue provided collectibility is reasonably assured 
our operations have experienced  and may continue to experience  period to period fluctuations in net service revenue and results from operations 
because we generate a large proportion of our revenues from services performed at hourly rates  our revenues in any period are directly related to the number of employees and the number of hours worked by those employees during that period 
our results of operations in any one quarter can fluctuate depending upon  among other things  the number of weeks in the quarter  the number and related contract value of ongoing client engagements  the commencement  postponement and termination of engagements in the quarter  the mix of revenue  the extent of cost overruns  employee hiring  employee utilization  vacation patterns  exchange rate fluctuations and other factors 
reimbursable out of pocket expenses on behalf of our clients  we pay fees to investigators and other out of pocket costs for which we are reimbursed at cost  without mark up or profit 
in connection with the required implementation on january   of financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force rule no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf  out of pocket costs are included in operating expenses  while the reimbursements received are reported separately as reimbursement revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
as is customary in the industry  we will continue to exclude from revenue and expense in the consolidated statements of income fees paid to investigators and the associated reimbursement since we act as an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsors with regard to investigator payments  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force rule no

concentration of credit risk our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of related billings on uncompleted contracts are concentrated with a small number of companies within the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
the significant majority of this exposure is to large  well established firms 
credit losses have historically been minimal 
as of december   the total of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of related billings on uncompleted contracts was million 
of this amount  the exposure to our three largest clients was of the total  with the three largest clients representing  and of total exposure  respectively

income taxes the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
because the company conducts business on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings losses among jurisdictions with varying tax rates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
the company has assessed the realization of deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance has been established against excess net operating losses based on an assessment that it is more likely than not that realization cannot be assured 
the ultimate realization of this tax benefit is dependent upon the generation of sufficient operating income in the respective tax jurisdictions 
goodwill and intangible assets the company follows the provisions of sfas no

 goodwill and other intangible assets  applicable to business combinations 
the company also follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  applicable to its accounting for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with these standards  goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition of remedium was not amortized 
however  the identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of remedium will be amortized over their useful lives 
pursuant to sfas no 
 management of the company must make an assessment of goodwill impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
if carrying value exceeds current fair value  then goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings 
management made an assessment of remedium s fair value as november   one year from the acquisition date  in order to determine whether the amount of goodwill and related intangible assets acquired had been impaired 
as of november   management determined that both goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of remedium were not impaired and that no adjustment to the carrying values was necessary as of that date 
due to changes in key personnel  adverse market conditions and a significant decrease in the company s market capital during the third quarter of  the company made an interim assessment of remedium s fair value as of september  to determine whether the amount of goodwill and the identifiable intangibles acquired in connection with the acquisition of remedium were impaired 
the test for impairment involves a two step 
table of contents process 
the first step of impairment testing involves a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit  in this case remedium  with its aggregate carrying values  including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
we determined the fair value of remedium using a combination of the income approach methodology of valuation  which includes using the discounted cash flow method  and the relative market value approach methodology 
the relative market value approach methodology includes the comparison of revenue and income multiples of comparable companies within the industry that the company operates 
if the carrying amount of remedium exceeds its fair value  we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
the second step of the impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of remedium s goodwill and identifiable intangibles with the respective carrying values 
as of september   management was able to complete the first step of the impairment testing  and estimated that the amount of goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition of remedium was impaired  necessitating a non cash impairment charge of million in the third quarter of and reducing the carrying value of goodwill 
management updated its step one analysis and completed the second step of the impairment analysis in accordance with sfas no 
as of november  and  due to the continued deterioration of the underlying comparable companies within the cro industry as it relates to the market value approach methodology  has determined that an additional non cash impairment charge of million is to be recorded in the fourth quarter of results of operations the following table sets forth amounts for certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
the following table excludes revenue and costs related to reimbursable out of pocket expenses because they are not generated by the services we provide  do not yield any gross profit to us  and do not have any impact on our net income 
we believe this information is useful to our investors because it presents the net revenue and expenses that are directly attributable to the services we provide to our clients and provides a more accurate picture of our operating results and margins 
percentage of net revenue  excluding reimbursable out of pocket expenses year ended december  net revenue operating expenses direct selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization impairment charge loss from operations net loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenue for decreased million to million as compared to million for  a decrease 
the decline in revenues for was primarily due to a million decrease in revenue generated in the united states  which was offset in part by a million increase in revenue generated by the company s european operations 
net revenues for generated in the us were million as compared to million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease in net revenues in the us was primarily due to a decrease in the number of contracts and related contract values of active clinical studies being conducted by the company in the united states during net revenues generated by our european operations were million as compared to million for  an increase of million 
of the million increase in net revenues generated by our european operations  million was attributable to favorable foreign currency fluctuations for the year ended december  as compared to the same prior year period 
approximately thousand of the increase in net revenues from our european operations was attributable to organic growth 
table of contents resulting from new business awards during as a percentage of total net revenues  net revenues for from our european operations represented compared to of net revenues for  an increase 
consequently  the percentage of net revenues generated in the united states has decreased from in to for due to the decline in the number of contracts and related contract values of active studies being conducted by the company s us operations 
our consolidated backlog at the end of decreased million to million compared to our backlog of million at the end of we may experience annual cost increases in the future in our ongoing clinical projects without a corresponding increase in revenues 
to the extent the actual estimated cost to complete utilized at the end of increased by to than the estimates actually utilized  the company s reported revenues would have been reduced by thousand and thousand  respectively 
the company s consolidated net loss for would have increased by the same amount as the decline in revenues 
this assumes that the company would have been unsuccessful in negotiating change orders during that would provide for reimbursement of the excess costs 
for periods beyond  the impact on the company s net income and financial position would depend upon the actual costs incurred to complete the project and whether the company was successful in negotiating change orders for reimbursement of the excess costs

 revenue recognition  for the company s revenue recognition accounting policies 
reimbursement revenue consisted of reimbursable out of pocket expenses incurred on behalf of our clients 
reimbursements are made at cost  without mark up or profit  and therefore have no impact on net income 
direct expenses included compensation and other expenses directly related to conducting clinical studies 
these costs increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in direct expenses resulted principally from a million increase in direct expenses incurred by our european operations which were offset in part by a million decrease in direct expenses incurred in the united states 
direct expenses incurred by our european operations totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
of the million increase in direct expense incurred by our european operations  approximately million was attributable to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations for the year ended december  as compared to the same prior year period 
in addition  direct expenses increased as a result of additional staff and subcontractors utilized to meet the resource requirements of active clinical trials being conducted by our european operations during compared to the same prior year period 
direct expenses in the united states totaled million for the year ended december  compared with million in  a million decrease 
the decrease in direct cost in the us was due to staff reductions and a decrease in subcontractors utilized to meet the resourcing requirements of active clinical trials in the us during compared to the same prior year period 
direct expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in direct expenses as a percentage of revenues was principally due to revenue reductions in the us resulting from a combination of decreased utilization of our personnel on clinical study activities and a decrease in the number of active clinical studies  as well as an increase in the number of personnel and subcontractors that were utilized on active clinical trials in europe 
the percentage increase was also impacted by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations from our european operations for the year ended december  compared with the same prior year period 
selling  general  and administrative expenses included the salaries  wages and benefits of all administrative  financial and business development personnel and all other support expenses not directly related to specific contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of the million increase in sg a  approximately thousand was attributable to the proposed acquisition of prologue and proposed business combination with linkcon that were terminated during the third quarter of sg a expenses incurred by our european operations increased by thousand to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  of the increase in

as of november  and  due to the continued deterioration of the underlying comparable companies within the cro industry as it related to the market value approach methodology  has determined that an additional non cash impairment charge of million is to be recorded in the fourth quarter of loss from operations for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the year ended december   primarily for the reasons noted in the preceding paragraphs 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased by thousand to thousand from thousand for the year ended december  the thousand decrease was due primarily to a reduction of amount of cash on hand during compared to the same prior year period 

table of contents the tax benefit recognized relates primarily to the reversal of a deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of remedium 
the deferred tax liability represents the difference between the assigned value of the intangible assets acquired and the tax basis of these assets

table of contents to continue as a going concern we will be required to obtain additional capital from external sources or significantly reduce our operating costs  which may include the cessation of operations in some countries 
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions  as well as conditions in our business and our operating results  and those factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all 
we have been working with an investment banking firm to seek strategic alternatives  including outside investments

net revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis 
we typically receive a low volume of large dollar receipts 
as a result  the number of days net revenue outstanding in accounts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of related billings  customer advances  and billings in excess of related costs will fluctuate due to the timing and size of billings and cash receipts
