item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in the communications technology industry  which is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards 
the market can be significantly affected by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants 
we compete for customers on the basis of existing and planned product features  service capabilities  company reputation  brand recognition  technical support  relationships with partners  quality and reliability  product development capabilities  price and availability 
we help customers connect  monitor  and control local or remote electronic devices over a network or via the internet 
we continue to leverage a common core technology base to develop and provide innovative connectivity solutions to our customers 
our drop in networking solutions initiative provides opportunities for us in the next wave of internet growth 
the initial wave was focused on connecting people  first with personal computers and then cell phones  pda s and other related consumer devices 
this next wave focuses on connecting devices and machines 
we are ideally positioned to take full advantage of the second wave of internet growth with our drop in networking solutions that will provide significant market expansion in what is now being referred to in the market as wireless machine to machine mm connectivity 
mm communication works by connecting communication hardware to a physical asset so that information about its status and performance can be sent to a computer system and used to automate a business process or a human action so that a person does not have to do it manually 
incorporating products from both our embedded and non embedded categories  our drop in networking solutions are making it easy for customers to effectively drop in a wireless mm solution 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we expanded on drop in networking and introduced our idigi solutions brand 
the idigi solution bundles software and services to our drop in networking product offerings to make mm deployments even easier  faster  and more economical 
at the heart of the idigi solution bundle is the idigi platform  a platform as a service paas that quickly and easily connects remote assets to a customer s business applications 
the idigi platform runs on a grid of digi managed servers 
as an on demand model  customers pay only for services consumed  conserving capital and requiring minimal infrastructure to operate 
idigi energy was launched as the first idigi solution bundle and targets the smart grid efforts of energy services providers 
our drop in networking and idigi solutions brand are enabling us to pivot our business from point products to solutions 
we believe we are improving our market position by increasing our investment in wireless products  expanding internationally  and providing full solutions which include product and services offerings to our customers 
our revenues consist of products that are in non embedded and embedded product groupings 
the non embedded products include serial cards  serial servers  usb connected products  cellular routers  cellular gateway products  network management applications  console servers  remote display products  wireless communications adapters  and cameras and sensors 
embedded products include chips  modules  single board computers  network interface cards nics and software and development tools  engineering design services and satellite communication products 
our non embedded serial cards and our embedded nics are in the mature phase of their product life cycles 
our strategy is to focus on key applications  customers and markets to efficiently manage the migration from products that are in the mature phase of their product life cycles to other newer technologies 
our business was negatively impacted by the effects of the severe downturn in the economy in fiscal we experienced a reduction in demand for our products in all geographic locations 
in response to the depressed economic conditions  we put in place a restructuring plan that included various cost reduction actions 
we also reduced our investment in lower growth product lines while increasing our investment in wireless products and solutions that include hardware  software and services 
these actions allowed us to reduce our profit breakeven point and remain profitable despite the negative economic conditions that existed throughout fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued on april   we announced a business restructuring to increase our focus on wireless products and solutions that include hardware  software and services 
the restructuring included the closing of an engineering facility in long beach  california  and the relocation and consolidation of the manufacturing facility in davis  california to our minneapolis  minnesota headquarters 
the restructuring resulted in a workforce reduction of positions or of our total workforce 
we believe that these restructuring actions will improve profitability in future quarters 
we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million during the third quarter of fiscal related to this restructuring 
we anticipate pre tax cost savings of approximately million per quarter during fiscal as a result of these initiatives see note to our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in june  we acquired substantially all the assets of mobiapps holdings private limited mobiapps  a developer of mm communications technology focusing on satellite  cellular  and hybrid satellite cellular solutions 
mobiapps provides a new generation of products based on its own custom designed and patented mixed signal application specific integrated circuit asic  which dramatically reduces the complexity and improves performance of satellite mm system solutions 
satellite mm applications include fleet management  marine vessel tracking  container tracking  agricultural monitoring  energy management  and remote field service applications 
satellite is especially suited to applications that cross country and continental boundaries  providing connectivity in very remote locations  and providing mission critical wireless backup solutions when cellular coverage is insufficient 
mobiapps also has cellular and hybrid cellular satellite products packaged with various asset tracking management services  including employee tracking  focused on markets in india and southeast asia 
we also suspended our non sales incentive compensation program for fiscal this program applies to executive management as well as a large part of the employee base 
in addition  we reduced our sales commission program for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net sales continued the decreases in both the direct oem and the distribution channels during fiscal are primarily resulting from a weakened economy 
we continued to focus on maintaining our channel strategy  which includes employing additional channel partners and releasing complementary products 
during fiscal  net sales in the direct oem channel decreased due to a decline in net sales in north america and a change in the product mix 
net sales by geographic area our revenue by geographic location of our customers is as follows net sales of net sales in millions north america europe  middle east africa asian countries latin america total net sales the decrease in net sales of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due in general to the weakened global economy which affected all geographic locations 
the decrease of million in net sales in north america was offset by incremental revenue of million from the spectrum acquisition and million from the mobiapps acquisition both included in embedded products 
the decrease in net sales in north america in fiscal is primarily due a reduction in net sales of non embedded products  partially offset by the increase in embedded products which includes the incremental net sales of million resulting from the spectrum acquisition 
the increase in net sales in europe  middle east  and africa emea during the past two fiscal years is primarily due to the acquisition of sarian which provided revenue of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue for the latin america and asian countries locations decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal and revenue increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in revenue for fiscal for the latin america location was primarily due to a reduction in net sales of non embedded products  and for the asian countries revenue decreased due to a reduction in net sales of both embedded and non embedded products primarily resulting from the global economic conditions 
mobiapps revenue of million from date of acquisition is included in fiscal asian countries revenue 
gross profit compared to gross margin for fiscal was compared to for the decrease in gross margin is primarily a result of product and customer mix changes

restructuring on april   we announced a business restructuring to increase our focus on wireless products and solutions that include hardware  software and services 
the restructuring included the closing of an engineering facility in long beach  california  and the relocation and consolidation of the manufacturing facility in davis  california to our minneapolis  minnesota headquarters 
we paid a lease cancellation fee for one of the leased facilities in davis and had vacated the facility as of september  we continue to maintain non manufacturing activities at the remaining leased facility in davis  california 
as a result of these initiatives  during the third quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge  which consisted of million for employee termination costs for positions and million for contract termination fees and other relocation costs

recent accounting developments in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting standards and provided guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue generating transaction where multiple deliverables exist  and provided guidance for allocation and recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables 
this guidance is expected to result in more multiple deliverable arrangements being separable than under current guidance 
this guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year beginning october  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this standard clarifies the existing accounting guidance such that tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality shall be excluded from the scope of the software revenue recognition accounting standards 
accordingly  sales of these products may fall within the scope of other revenue recognition accounting standards or may now be within the scope of this standard and may require an allocation of the arrangement consideration for each element of the arrangement 
this guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year beginning october  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a new standard on business combinations 
this new standard retained the fundamental requirements in the former standard that the acquisition method of accounting previously referred to as the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
this standard defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and established the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control 
the new standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
this new standard also makes certain other modifications to the former standard and is effective for business combinations that are consummated by us beginning october  early adoption is not permitted 
we adopted this standard effective october  and this standard could have a material impact on how we will identify  negotiate  and value future acquisitions and how such acquisitions will affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of embedded and non embedded products to our distributors and direct end user oem customers  and to a small extent from the sale of software licenses  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services and royalties 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and there are no post delivery obligations other than warranty 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers 
sales to authorized domestic distributors and direct oems are made with certain rights of return and price adjustment provisions 
estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments are established by us based on an analysis of historical patterns of returns and price adjustments as well as an analysis of authorized returns compared to received returns  current on hand inventory at distributors  and distribution sales for the current period 
estimated reserves for future returns and price adjustments are charged against revenues in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded 
material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for estimating reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments for all years presented 
the reserve for future returns and pricing adjustments was million and million at september  and  respectively 
we also generate revenue from the sale of software licenses  post contract customer support  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services and royalties 
revenue recognized resulting from such non product sales represented of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal our software development tools and development boards often include multiple elements  including hardware  software licenses  post contract customer support  limited training and basic hardware design review 
our customers purchase these products and services during their product development process in which they use the tools to build network connectivity into the devices they are manufacturing 
revenue for software licenses  professional and engineering services and training is recognized upon performance  which includes delivery of a final product version and acceptance by the customer 
for post contract customer support and fees associated with technical support  revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract as service is performed 
unearned post contract customer support and unearned nonrecurring engineering services revenue is included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our marketable securities 
when assessing marketable securities for other than temporary declines in value  we consider factors including how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class  the performance of the issuer s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued cash equivalents and marketable securities continued industry  expected market volatility  analyst recommendations  the views of external investment managers  any news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the issuer operates 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these securities has occurred and is other than temporary  we would record a charge to other income expense 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we hold one security that is other than temporarily impaired 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects the estimate of losses that may result from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on known circumstances regarding collectability of customer accounts and historical collections experience 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences between the historical trends used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and actual collection experience could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at september  and million at september  inventories and reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we reduce the carrying value of our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if actual product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for the net realizable value of inventories 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at september  and  respectively 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of june  or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
based on our annual goodwill impairment assessment on june   we concluded that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount and therefore potential goodwill impairment was not indicated 
we continue to closely monitor the continuing impacts of the economic downturn on our expected operating results and the broader effects of us market conditions on the fair value of our assets 
as of september  our market capitalization was below the carrying value of our reporting unit due to a decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter of fiscal however  our market capitalization plus our estimated control premium of resulted in a fair value in excess of our carrying value and therefore no impairment was indicated 
the control premium represents the amount an investor would pay  over and above market capitalization  in order to obtain a controlling interest in a company 
the estimated control premium was determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the us and outside of the us accordingly  we must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
this determination requires us to make several estimates and assumptions
