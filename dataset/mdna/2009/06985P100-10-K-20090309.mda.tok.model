item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s overview we provide a wide range of well site services to oil and gas drilling and producing companies  including well servicing  fluid services  completion and remedial services and contract drilling services 
our results of operations reflect the impact of our acquisition strategy as a leading consolidator in the domestic land based well services industry 
our acquisitions have increased our breadth of service offerings at the well site and expanded our market presence 
in implementing this strategy  we have purchased businesses and assets in separate acquisitions from january  to december  our weighted average number of well servicing rigs increased from in to in the fourth quarter of  and our weighted average number of fluid service trucks increased from to in the same period 
we added trucks through the acquisition of azurite services company  inc  azurite leasing company  llc  and freestone disposal  lp collectively azurite in the third quarter of we significantly increased our completion and remedial services segment  principally through the acquisition of jetstar consolidated holdings  inc in the first quarter of our weighted average number of drilling rigs increased from two in the first quarter of to nine in the fourth quarter of  principally through the acquisition of sledge drilling holding corp 
in the second quarter of these acquisitions make changes in revenues  expenses and income not directly comparable between periods 
basic revised its business segments beginning in the first quarter of  and in connection therewith  restated the corresponding items of segment information for earlier periods 
the new operating segments are well servicing  fluid services  completion and remedial services  and contract drilling 
these segments were selected based on changes in management s resource allocation and performance assessment in making decisions regarding the company 
contract drilling was previously included in our well servicing segment 
the well site construction services segment was consolidated into our fluid services segment 
these changes reflect basic s operating focus in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 

table of contents our operating revenues from each of our segments  and their relative percentages of our total revenues  consisted of the following dollars in millions year ended december  revenues well servicing fluid services completion and remedial services contract drilling total revenues our core businesses depend on our customers willingness to make expenditures to produce  develop and explore for oil and gas in the united states 
industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors  such as the supply of and demand for oil and gas  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers 
the volatility of the oil and gas industry  and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity  could adversely impact the level of drilling and workover activity by some of our customers 
this volatility affects the demand for our services and the price of our services 
in addition  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in our market areas also may have an impact on our business  even in an environment of stronger oil and gas prices 
for a more comprehensive discussion of our industry trends  see general industry overview included in items and  business and properties  of this annual report on form k 
we derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting production from existing oil and gas operations 
demand for these production related services  including well servicing and fluid services  tends to remain relatively stable  even in moderate oil and gas price environments  as ongoing maintenance spending is required to sustain production 
as oil and gas prices reach higher levels  demand for all of our services generally increases as our customers engage in more well servicing activities relating to existing wells to maintain or increase oil and gas production from those wells 
because our services are required to support drilling and workover activities  our revenues will vary based on changes in capital spending by our customers as oil and gas prices increase or decrease 
during  our business activity levels increased due to the impact of higher oil and gas prices and the expansion of our equipment fleets 
in  natural gas prices declined as an excess supply of natural gas began to occur  mainly due to moderate us weather patterns 
utilization for our services declined from levels as drilling activity flattened or declined in several of our markets and new equipment entered the marketplace balancing supply and demand for our services 
however  pricing for our services improved in from  mainly reflecting continued increases in labor costs  and offset a portion the effect of the lower utilization of our services on our total revenues 
by the middle of  oil and natural gas prices reached historic highs 
however  in the second half of there were significant decreases in oil and natural gas prices  which caused significantly lower utilization of our services in the fourth quarter of for  we expect oil and gas prices to remain substantially below the levels required to support aggressive capital spending programs by our customers and that their maintenance related spending will be deferred for as long as possible 
the reduced spending by our customers will result in significantly lower demand for our services and increased price competition among the service providers in each of our segments 
we anticipate that utilization  revenue and margins will be substantially below levels 
we do not currently believe that the changes being experienced during the first quarter of and anticipated later in will affect the company s compliance with the financial covenants in its debt agreements 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our business through selective acquisitions and internal growth initiatives 
our capital investment decisions are determined by an analysis of the projected return on capital employed of each of those alternatives  which is substantially driven by the cost to acquire existing assets from a third party  the capital required to build new equipment and the point in the oil and gas commodity price cycle 
based on these factors  we make capital investment decisions that we believe will support our long term growth strategy 
while we believe our costs of integration for prior acquisitions have been reflected in our historical results of operations  integration of acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or require a 
table of contents disproportionate amount of our management s attention 
as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  we also must meet certain financial covenants in order to borrow money under our existing credit agreement to fund future acquisitions 
we believe that the most important performance measures for our lines of business are as follows well servicing rig hours  rig utilization rate  revenue per rig hour and segment profits as a percent of revenues  fluid services revenue per truck and segment profits as a percent of revenues  completion and remedial services segment profits as a percent of revenues  and contract drilling rig operating days  revenue per drilling day and segment profits as a percent of revenues 
segment profits are computed as segment operating revenues less direct operating costs 
these measurements provide important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business 
for a detailed analysis of these indicators for our company  see segment overview below

table of contents segment overview well servicing in  our well servicing segment represented of our revenues 
revenue in our well servicing segment is derived from maintenance  workover  completion and plugging and abandonment services 
we provide maintenance related services as part of the normal  periodic upkeep of producing oil and gas wells 
maintenance related services represent a relatively consistent component of our business 
workover and completion services generate more revenue per hour than maintenance work due to the use of auxiliary equipment  but demand for workover and completion services fluctuates more with the overall activity level in the industry 
we typically charge our well servicing rig customers for services on an hourly basis at rates that are determined by the type of service and equipment required  market conditions in the region in which the rig operates  the ancillary equipment provided on the rig and the necessary personnel 
we measure the activity level of our well servicing rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate which is based on a hour work week per rig 
our well servicing rig fleet increased from a weighted average number of rigs in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of through a combination of newbuild purchases  acquisitions  and other individual equipment purchases 
the following is an analysis of our well servicing segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december   and weighted average rig profits number of rig utilization revenue per per rig segment rigs hours rate rig hour hour profits first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge activity levels in our well servicing rig operations based on rig utilization rate  revenue per rig hour and profits per rig hour 
fluid services in  our fluid services segment represented of our revenues 
revenues in our fluid services segment are earned from the sale  transportation  storage and disposal of fluids used in the drilling  production and maintenance of oil and gas wells 
revenues also include well site construction and maintenance services 
the fluid services segment has a base level of business consisting of transporting and disposing of salt water produced as a by product of the production of oil and gas 
these services are necessary for our customers and generally have a stable 
table of contents demand but typically produce lower relative segment profits than other parts of our fluid services segment 
fluid services for completion and workover projects typically require fresh or brine water for making drilling mud  circulating fluids or frac fluids used during a job  and all of these fluids require storage tanks and hauling and disposal 
because we can provide a full complement of fluid sales  trucking  storage and disposal required on most drilling and workover projects  the add on services associated with drilling and workover activity enable us to generate higher segment profits contributions 
the higher segment profits are due to the relatively small incremental labor costs associated with providing these services in addition to our base fluid services segment 
revenues from our well site constructions services are derived primarily from preparing and maintaining access roads and well locations  installing small diameter gathering lines and pipelines  constructing foundations to support drilling rigs and providing maintenance services for oil and gas facilities 
we typically price fluid services by the job  by the hour or by the quantities sold  disposed of or hauled 
the following is an analysis of our fluid services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december   and dollars in thousands segment weighted profits average per number of revenue per fluid fluid service fluid service service segment trucks truck truck profits first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge activity levels in our fluid services segment based on revenue and segment profits per fluid service truck 
completion and remedial services in  our completion and remedial services segment represented of our revenues 
revenues from our completion and remedial services segment are generally derived from a variety of services designed to stimulate oil and gas production or place cement slurry within the wellbores 
our completion and remedial services segment includes pressure pumping  rental and fishing tool operations  cased hole wireline services and underbalanced drilling 
our pressure pumping operations concentrate on providing single truck  lower horsepower cementing  acidizing and fracturing services in selected markets 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of jetstar consolidated holdings  inc this acquisition allowed us to enter into the southwest kansas market and increased our presence in north texas 
our total hydraulic horsepower capacity for our pressure pumping operations was approximately  horsepower at december  compared to  horsepower at december  and  horsepower at december  
table of contents we entered the rental and fishing tool business through our acquisition of g l in the first quarter of this acquisition consisted of rental and fishing tool stores in the north texas  west texas  and oklahoma markets 
we have since further expanded this business line with several acquisitions and had rental and fishing tool stores as of december  we entered the wireline business in with our acquisition of aws wireline  a regional firm based in north texas 
we entered the underbalanced drilling services business in through our acquisition of energy air drilling services  a business operating in northwest new mexico and the western slope of colorado markets 
for a description of our wireline and underbalanced drilling services  please read overview of our segments and services completion and remedial services segment included in items and  business and properties  of this annual report on form k 
in this segment  we generally derive our revenues on a project by project basis in a competitive bidding process 
our bids are generally based on the amount and type of equipment and personnel required  with the materials consumed billed separately 
during periods of decreased spending by oil and gas companies  we may be required to discount our rates to remain competitive  which would cause lower segment profits 
the following is an analysis of our completion and remedial services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december   and dollars in thousands segment revenues profits first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge the performance of our completion and remedial services segment based on the segment s operating revenues and segment profits 
contract drilling in  our contract drilling segment represented of our revenues 
revenues from our contract drilling segment are derived primarily from the drilling of new wells 
within this segment  we typically charge our drilling rig customers at a daywork daily rate  or footage at an established rate per number of feet drilled 
depending on the type of job  we may also charge by the project 
we measure the activity level of our drilling rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate which is based on a seven day work week per rig 
our contract drilling rig fleet grew from two during the first quarter of to nine by the fourth quarter of  due to the sledge acquisition in april 
table of contents the following is an analysis of our contract drilling segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december    and dollars in thousands weighted average rig number of operating revenue profits loss segment rigs days per day per day profits first quarter nm nm nm second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge activity levels in our drilling operations based on rig operating days  revenue per day  and profits per drilling day 
the results of the first quarter are not considered meaningful  due to the start up nature of the drilling operations  and the fact that only twelve operating days were completed in this quarter 
operating cost overview our operating costs are comprised primarily of labor  including workers compensation and health insurance  repair and maintenance  fuel and insurance 
a majority of our employees are paid on an hourly basis 
we also incur costs to employ personnel to sell and supervise our services and perform maintenance on our fleet 
these costs are not directly tied to our level of business activity 
compensation for our administrative personnel in local operating yards and in our corporate office is accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
repair and maintenance is performed by our crews  company maintenance personnel and outside service providers 
insurance is generally a fixed cost regardless of utilization and relates to the number of rigs  trucks and other equipment in our fleet  employee payroll and our safety record 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
a complete summary of these policies is included in note of the notes to our historical consolidated financial statements 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
critical accounting policies we have identified below accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost  or at estimated fair value at acquisition date if acquired in a business combination 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as 
table of contents incurred 
we also review the capitalization of refurbishment of workover rigs as described in note of the notes to our historical consolidated financial statements 
impairments 
we review our assets for impairment at a minimum annually  or whenever  in management s judgment  events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recovered over its remaining service life 
provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when the sum of the estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  is less than the assets carrying amount 
when impairment is indicated  an impairment charge is recorded based on an estimate of future cash flows on a discounted basis 
self insured risk accruals 
we are self insured up to retention limits with regard to workers compensation and medical and dental coverage of our employees 
we generally maintain no physical property damage coverage on our workover rig fleet  with the exception of certain of our hour workover rigs and newly manufactured rigs 
we have deductibles per occurrence for workers compensation and medical and dental coverage of  and  respectively 
we have lower deductibles per occurrence for automobile liability and general liability 
we maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self insurance retentions by using third party actuarial data and historical claims history 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when the services are performed  collection of the relevant receivables is probable  persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and the price is fixed and determinable 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes based upon sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
depreciation and amortization 
in order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment and our intangible assets with finite lives  we estimate the useful lives and salvage values of these items 
our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
impairment of property and equipment 
our impairment of property and equipment requires us to estimate undiscounted future cash flows 
actual impairment charges are recorded using an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows requires us to estimate rates and utilization in future periods and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
impairment of goodwill 
our goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized 
we assess impairment of our goodwill annually as of december or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires a two step process for testing impairment 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists 
if impairment is indicated  then the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the 
table of contents reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
in step one of the annual impairment test and due to the adverse equity market conditions affecting the company s common stock price and the declines in oil and natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of and continuing into  the company tested its four reporting units  well servicing  fluid services  completion and remedial services  and contract drilling  for impairment 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting units the company used a weighting of the discounted cash flow method  the guideline transaction method  and the public company guideline method 
the company weighted the discounted cash flow method in its analysis and the other two methods combined due to differences between the company s reporting units and the peer companies size  profitability and diversity of operations 
in order to validate the reasonableness of the estimated fair values obtained for the reporting units  a reconciliation of fair value to market capitalization was performed 
the control premium used in the reconciliation was derived from a market transaction data study along with historical control premiums from other basic acquisitions 
the measurement date for the stock price for the reconciliation was the closing price on december  based on the results of step one  impairment was indicated in the contract drilling reporting unit but not in the other three reporting units 
as a result the company tested the contract drilling reporting unit s long lived assets for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 which indicated no impairment 
the company performed step two for the contract drilling unit by allocating the estimated fair value to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  which indicated that the entire value of the goodwill in contract drilling of million was impaired 
this non cash charge eliminates the goodwill recorded in connection with the sledge acquisition in the goodwill associated with this acquisition has no tax basis  and accordingly  there is no tax benefit derived from recording the impairment charge 
further declines in the company s stock price and general market conditions may be considered as a triggering event for the first quarter of if this is the case  the company will analyze its goodwill as of march  and potentially record further goodwill impairments in its well servicing  fluid services and or completion and remedial services reporting units 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of historical collection activity and specific identification of overdue accounts 
factors that may affect this estimate include changes in the financial positions of significant customers and a decline in commodity prices that could affect the entire customer base 
litigation and self insured risk reserves 
we estimate our reserves related to litigation and self insured risk based on the facts and circumstances specific to the litigation and self insured risk claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of litigation and insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
as discussed in self insured risk accruals above with respect to our critical accounting policies  we maintain accruals on our balance sheet to cover self insured retentions 
these accruals are based on certain assumptions developed using third party data and historical data to project future losses 
loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  which involves the use of various assumptions 
these estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair value of property and equipment  intangible assets and the resulting amount of goodwill  if any 
we test annually for impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives recorded in business combinations 
this requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities at the reporting unit level 
therefore  considerable judgment  similar to that described above in connection with our estimation of the fair value of acquired company  is required to assess goodwill and certain intangible assets for impairment 
cash flow estimates 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on the most recent available market and operating data for the applicable asset or reporting unit at the time the estimate is made 
our cash flow estimates are used for asset impairment analyses 

table of contents stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
prior to january   we accounted for share based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
which was permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

we adopted sfas no 
r using both the modified prospective method and the prospective method as applicable to the specific awards granted 
the modified prospective method was applied to awards granted subsequent to the company becoming a public company 
awards granted prior to the company becoming public and which were accounted for under apb no 
were adopted by using the prospective method 
the results of prior periods have not been restated 
compensation expense of the unvested portion of awards granted as a private company and outstanding as of january  will continue to be based upon the intrinsic value method calculated under apb no 
the fair value of common stock for options granted from july  through september  was estimated by management using an internal valuation methodology 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist because we were focused on internal growth and acquisitions and because we had consistently used our internal valuation methodology for previous stock awards 
income taxes 
the amount and availability of our loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to a variety of interpretations and restrictive tests 
the utilization of such carryforwards could be limited or lost upon certain changes in ownership and the passage of time 
accordingly  although we believe substantial loss carryforwards are available to us  no assurance can be given concerning the realization of such loss carryforwards  or whether or not such loss carryforwards will be available in the future 
asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and to capitalize an equal amount as a cost of the asset  depreciating it over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation is adjusted at the end of each quarter to reflect the passage of time  changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation  acquisition or construction of assets  and settlement of obligations 
results of operations the results of operations between periods will not be comparable  primarily due to the significant number of acquisitions made and their relative timing in the year acquired 
see note of the notes to our historical consolidated financial statements for more detail 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by to billion in from million in this increase was primarily due to acquisitions in the completion and remedial services and fluid services segments  and to the internal expansion of our business segments 
well servicing revenues increased by less than to million in compared to million in revenue remained relatively flat due to the increase in rig hours to  in as compared to  in being offset by a decrease in revenue per rig hour to in from in similarly  an increase in the weighted average number of rigs was offset by lower utilization rates 
our weighted average number of rigs increased to in from in the increase was due to the addition of newbuild rigs  rigs from acquisitions and the conversion of one drilling rig to workover mode  offset by the retirement of rigs in the rig utilization rate for our well servicing rigs declined to in compared to in fluid services revenues increased by to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the azurite acquisition and internal growth 
the azurite acquisition added trucks  frac tanks and six disposal wells  which increased revenues by approximately million in our weighted average number of fluid service trucks increased to in compared to in  an increase of approximately 
during  our average revenue per fluid service truck was approximately  as compared to  in 
table of contents completion and remedial services revenues increased by to million in as compared to million in the increase in revenue between these periods was primarily the result of the acquisition of jetstar in march  xterra in january and triple n services  inc triple n in may the yards associated with the jetstar acquisition added approximately million more in revenue in compared to  the xterra yards added million in revenues for and the triple n yards added million in revenues for there was also improved utilization for our services in due to higher oil and natural gas prices for the majority of contract drilling revenues increased by to million in compared to million in the increase was due mainly to the acquisition of sledge in april  which added approximately million more in revenues in compared to there was also an increase in rig operating days to  in compared to  in  an increase of 
revenue per drilling day was  in compared to  in  a decrease of 
direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses  which primarily consist of labor  including workers compensation and health insurance  and maintenance and repair costs  increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we completed in  the expansion of our well servicing rig and fluid service truck fleets  and increases in personnel and related benefit costs 
direct operating expenses increased to of revenues in from in direct operating expenses for the well servicing segment increased by to million in as compared to million in due primarily to the expansion of our well servicing rig fleet 
segment profits decreased to of revenues in compared to in  which reflects higher fuel costs in and higher labor costs since we generally retain our rig crews during times of lower utilization 
direct operating expenses for the fluid services segment increased by to million in as compared to million in due primarily to the expansion of our fluid services fleet 
the azurite acquisition added approximately million in operating expense in segment profits decreased slightly to of revenues in compared to in  mainly due to higher fuel costs 
direct operating expenses for the completion and remedial services segment increased by to million in as compared to million in due primarily to the expansion of our services and equipment  including the jetstar  xterra and triple n acquisitions  and higher operating costs 
jetstar operating expenses were approximately million more in than in  xterra operating expenses were million in and triple n operating expenses were million in our segment profits decreased to of revenues in from in  as we experienced higher fuel costs and increases in costs of the materials used in our pressure pumping operations 
direct operating expenses for the contract drilling segment increased by to million in as compared to million in the sledge acquisition added approximately million of operating expenses 
our segment profits decreased to of revenues in from in  as we experienced increased fuel and transportation expense 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in  which included million and million of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
the increase primarily reflects higher salary and office expenses related to the expansion of our business 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million in  as compared to million in  reflecting the increase in the size of and investment in our asset base 
we invested million for acquisitions  million for capital leases and an additional million for capital expenditures in goodwill impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge totaling million to impair the contract drilling goodwill 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense decreased by to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates on our revolving line of credit  which was offset by an increase in interest expense due to the million draw down on our revolver in september other income and expense 
other income and expense included million of merger costs associated with the terminated merger agreement with grey wolf  inc  offset by termination payments received from grey wolf  inc for million 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in  as compared to million in our effective tax rate was approximately in and in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to acquisitions in the completion and remedial services and well servicing segments  and to the internal expansion of our business segments  mainly well servicing 
well servicing revenues increased by to million in compared to million in the increase was mainly due to internal growth of this segment as we added newbuild rigs to our fleet in our weighted average number of well servicing rigs increased to in compared to in  an increase of approximately 
the rig utilization rate for our well servicing rigs declined to in compared to in this decline was due to stabilization of industry markets after experiencing significant growth throughout and the effect on revenue from this lower rig utilization rate was partially offset by an increase of in our revenue per rig hour from  which increased to per rig hour  and the expansion of our well servicing fleet 
fluid services revenues increased by to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to our internal growth and acquisitions
