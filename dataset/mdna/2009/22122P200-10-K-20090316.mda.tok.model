item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended december   december  and january  should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements below and elsewhere in this annual report 
business overview system wide restaurants fiscal year company company company owned franchise total owned franchise total owned franchise total restaurants at beginning of period c b a new restaurants opened restaurants permanently closed restaurants at end of period c b a includes six locations that are classified as discontinued operations 
b includes nine locations that are classified as discontinued operations 
c includes three locations that are classified as discontinued operations 
there are currently company owned and franchise premium convenience restaurants operating in states  the district of columbia  and the united arab emirates uae  of which one franchised restaurant opened subsequent to fiscal in the uae 
in addition  we closed three company owned and three franchise restaurants 
table of contents subsequent to fiscal  of which two were in the chicago area  two were in pennsylvania  and two were in new jersey 
one additional company owned restaurant in the chicago area is scheduled to close during the first quarter of fiscal our restaurants offer innovative savory made to order products featuring our authentic hearth baked crackly crust signature cosi bread and fresh distinctive ingredients 
we maintain a pipeline of new menu offerings that are introduced seasonally through limited time offerings to keep our products relevant to our target customers 
our menu features high quality sandwiches  freshly tossed salads  cosi bagels  hot melts  flatbread pizzas  s mores and other desserts  and a variety of coffees along with other soft drink beverages  bottled beverages including premium still and sparkling water  teas  alcoholic beverages  and other specialty coffees 
our restaurants offer lunch and afternoon coffee in a counter service format  with most offering breakfast and or dinner and dessert menus as well 
we operate our company owned restaurants in two formats cosi and cosi downtown 
cosi downtown restaurants  which are located in nonresidential central business districts  close for the day in the early evening  while cosi restaurants offer dinner and dessert in a casual dining atmosphere 
we are currently eligible to offer franchises in states and the district of columbia 
we offer franchises to area developers and individual franchise operators 
the initial franchise fee  payable to us  for both an area developer and an individual franchise operator  is  for the first restaurant and  for each additional restaurant 
we believe that offering cosi franchised restaurants to area developers and individual franchisees offers the prospects of strong financial returns 
by franchising  we believe we will be able to increase the presence of our restaurants in various markets throughout the country and generate additional revenue without the large upfront capital commitments and risk associated with opening company owned restaurants 
we believe that incorporating a franchising and area developer model into our strategy will position us to maximize the market potential for the cosi brand and concept consistent with our available capital and we expect that company owned restaurants restaurants that we own as opposed to franchised restaurants will always be an important part of our new restaurant growth 
during fiscal  we opened one and permanently closed seven company owned restaurants  of which three were underperforming locations  one location where the lease expired and we were unable to negotiate acceptable renewal terms  and three locations in seattle  washington where we exited the market and sold the assets at those locations to a local restaurant development company that is operating them under a different brand 
recent developments as previously announced  our board  consistent with its fiduciary duties  has formed a special committee of independent directors to review and evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value 
the special committee has engaged an investment banking firm to act as its financial advisor in connection with this review 
the special committee is assessing a wide variety of options to improve our business and competitive position  including  but not limited to  opportunities for organizational and operational improvement  a possible merger or sale  acquisition opportunities  third party investment and other strategic alternatives 
the board has not set any specific timeline for the completion of this strategic review  and there is no assurance that as a result of this review  the board will decide upon any particular course of action or engage in any specific transaction 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable and generally accepted for companies in the restaurant industry 
we believe that the following addresses the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require 
table of contents management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires management judgments regarding the future operating and disposition plans for marginally performing assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the application of sfas has affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results that have been significant in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment at the individual restaurant level whenever we determine impairment factors are present and at least annually 
we consider a consistent history of poor financial operating performance to be the primary indicator of potential impairment for individual restaurant locations 
we determine whether a restaurant location is impaired based on expected undiscounted cash flows  generally for the remainder of the lease term  and then determine the impairment charge based on discounted cash flows for the same period 
lease termination charges sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred  rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
for all exit activities  we estimate our likely liability under contractual leases for restaurants that have been closed 
such estimates have affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results and are impacted by management s judgments about the time it may take to find a suitable subtenant or assignee  or the terms under which a termination of the lease agreement may be negotiated with the landlord 
stock based compensation expense we recognize stock based compensation expense according to the fair value recognition provision of sfas r  share based payment  which generally requires  among other things  that all employee share based compensation be measured using a fair value method and that all the resulting compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements 
stock based compensation expense that we recognized for all fiscal years reported reflect the adoption of sfas r 
we measure the estimated fair value of our granted stock options using a black scholes pricing model and of our restricted stock based on the fair market value of a share of registered stock on the date of grant 
the weighted average fair values of the stock options granted through  the last time we issued stock options  calculated in accordance with sfas r were determined using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions expected dividend yield expected stock price volatility average risk free interest rate average expected life of options years weighted average grant date fair value we estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation 
pre vesting forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical data 
the expected volatility is based on an average of the historical volatility of the company s stock  the implied volatility of market options  peer company volatility  and other factors 
the average expected life represents the period of time that stock option grants are expected to be outstanding and is derived from historical terms and other factors 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rate of us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining term equal to the expected life of stock option grants 
accounting for lease obligations in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term  commencing on the date we take possession 
we include any rent escalations  rent abatements during construction periods and other rent holidays in our straight line rent expense calculation 
landlord allowances in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  we record landlord allowances as deferred rent in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortize them on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 

table of contents income taxes we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets related primarily to net operating loss carry forwards 
our determination of the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carry forward based on the company s operating results 
a positive adjustment to income will be recorded in future years if we determine that we could realize these deferred tax assets 
we have adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin as of january  fin prescribes a comprehensive financial statement model of how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns 
fin requires that only income tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold be recognized or continue to be recognized on the effective date 
initial recognition amounts would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
no adjustment was made to the beginning retained earnings balance  as the ultimate deductibility of all tax positions is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility 
no interest or penalties have been accrued relative to tax positions due to the company having either a tax loss or net operating loss carry forwards to offset any taxable income in all subject years 
as a result  no liability for uncertain tax positions has been recorded 
should the company need to accrue interest or penalties on uncertain tax positions  it would recognize the interest as interest expense and the penalties as a general and administrative expense 
revenue restaurant net sales 
our company owned restaurant sales are composed almost entirely of food and beverage sales 
we record revenue at the time of the purchase of our products by our customers 
franchise fees and royalties 
franchise fees and royalties includes fees earned from franchise agreements entered into with area developers and franchise operators  as well as royalties received based on sales generated at franchised restaurants 
we recognize the franchise fee in the period in which a franchise location opens or when fees are forfeited as a result of a termination of an area developer agreement 
we recognize franchise royalties in the period in which sales are made by our franchise operators 
gift card sales 
we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase gift cards at our restaurants and through our website 
customers can purchase these cards at varying dollar amounts 
at the time of purchase by the customer  we record a gift card liability for the face value of the card purchased 
we recognize the revenue and reduce the gift card liability when the gift card is redeemed 
we do not reduce our recorded liability for potential non use of purchased gift cards 
comparable restaurant sales in calculating comparable restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for full months 
we remove from the comparable restaurant base any restaurant that is temporarily shut down for remodeling for a complete period in the period that it is shut down

net cash provided by operating activities during the twelve month period ended december   was approximately million compared to million of net cash used in operating activities in the twelve month period ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was the result of a lower year over year operating loss  the reduction of receivables from landlords and a shift in the timing of payments of certain accrued expenses

table of contents total capital expenditures during fiscal were approximately million  compared to expenditures of million during fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal were primarily for the construction of a new restaurant and maintenance of existing restaurants 
capital expenditures during fiscal were primarily associated with the construction of nine new company owned restaurants that opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal  including one restaurant that opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal and remodel and maintenance costs associated with existing company owned locations 
cash provided by financing activities of approximately million and million during fiscals and  respectively  was primarily from proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options 
we opened one new company owned restaurant during fiscal and currently do not expect to open any additional company owned restaurants in fiscal we estimate the cost to open a company owned restaurant is approximately  net of landlord contributions and including pre opening expenses 
we do not expect to incur any significant remodeling capital costs during fiscal however  we do expect to incur capital maintenance costs on existing company owned restaurants 
as we currently have no credit facility or available line of credit  we expect to fund any required capital maintenance costs on existing company owned locations from cash and cash equivalents on hand  expected cash flows generated by existing company owned restaurants and expected franchise fees and royalties 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  and expected cash flows from company owned restaurant operations and franchise fees and royalties will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for working capital needs and maintenance in existing restaurant locations for the next twelve months 
our conclusion is based on expected performance for and included a sensitivity analysis that projected varying levels of decline in consumer demand in the range of levels selected was based on our reasonable expectation of demand given the seasonality of our historical performance and the potential impact the current economic environment may have on consumer spending 
in analyzing our capital cash outlays during fiscal  of our capital cash outlay was spent on construction of new company owned restaurants and another of our cash outlay was spent on maintenance costs associated with existing company owned locations 
due to having spent significant capital over the last three years to remodel and refresh existing locations as well as a number of the locations having only been opened within the last three years  we currently do not anticipate significant levels of cash outlays for capital expenditures during fiscal however  if our existing and new company owned restaurants do not generate the cash flow levels that we expect  if new franchised restaurants do not open according to our expectations  or if we do not generate the franchise fees and royalties that we currently expect  then we may have to initiate further labor reductions in general and administrative support functions  seek to sell certain company owned locations to franchisees or other third parties or seek other sources of debt or equity financing 
in such circumstances  there could be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such debt or equity financing or sell company owned locations to franchisees 
if the prevailing instability in the credit and financial markets continues  it may be more difficult for the company to obtain additional financing and for franchisees to obtain financing necessary to open restaurants or to acquire company owned locations 
an inability to access additional sources of liquidity to fund our cash needs could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and interest that we may pay on debt 
we have no derivative financial commodity instruments 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  highly liquid  short term investments 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and 
table of contents results of operations 
during fiscal we held no short term investments and  as a result  a hypothetical one percentage point interest change from those in effect during fiscal would not have resulted in a fluctuation of interest income 
in fiscals and  interest income was million and million  respectively 
foreign currency risk as of fiscal  all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts denominated  in us dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency risk 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our business are food and labor costs 
some of our food costs are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices 
volatility in the commodity markets such as the wheat and dairy markets can have an adverse impact on our results from operations 
some of our hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage will directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
historically  inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operation
