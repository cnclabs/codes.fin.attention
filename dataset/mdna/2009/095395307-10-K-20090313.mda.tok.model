item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a review of certain aspects of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with item description of business and item notes to consolidated financial statements 
executive summary we are engaged in two lines of business i pipeline transportation services to producer shippers  and ii oil and gas exploration and production 
our assets are located offshore and onshore in the texas gulf coast area 
our goal is to create greater long term value for our stockholders by increasing the utilization of our existing pipeline assets and acquiring additional strategic assets that diversify our asset base  improve our competitive position and are accretive to earnings 
although we are primarily focused on acquisitions of pipeline assets and maximizing our current facilities  we also continue to review  evaluate opportunities and acquire additional oil and gas properties 
pipeline transportation 
despite an increase in revenues from our pipeline operations in as a result of commencement of deliveries of production from shippers on both the blue dolphin pipeline system and the ga pipeline  we experienced a decline in revenues from our pipeline operations in the decline in revenues resulted from no additional shippers into either the blue dolphin pipeline system or the ga pipeline  as well as a temporary shut down of operations on both pipelines immediately preceding and following hurricane ike in september a successful well was drilled in galveston area block in the latter part of we have had discussions with the operator and expect that the well will connect to the blue dolphin pipeline system in the second quarter of the blue dolphin system is currently transporting an aggregate of approximately mmcf of gas per day from ten shippers 
the ga pipeline is currently transporting an aggregate of approximately mmcf of gas per day from six shippers 
oil and gas exploration and production 
galveston area block in september  although we elected not to participate in an exploratory well in galveston area block  we maintained a overriding royalty interest in the exploratory well 
drilling of the well commenced in late december and continued through early january the well was successfully completed and we expect production to commence in the second quarter of production will be delivered through the blue dolphin pipe line system 
high island block during  a well in high island block that had previously earned us a working interest was re entered and sidetracked successfully 
production from the well commenced in late november the well resumed production in the first quarter of after being shut in  due to damage to third party onshore facilities resulting from hurricane ike in september high island block the a well resumed production in the first quarter of after being shut in due to damage to third party onshore facilities resulting from hurricane ike in september in early  we elected to participate in an exploratory well in high island block at our working interest 
drilling of the exploratory b well commenced in mid april the b well was determined to be non commercial and was plugged and abandoned in the third quarter of 
table of contents our pipeline assets remain significantly under utilized 
the blue dolphin system is currently operating at approximately of capacity  the ga pipeline is currently operating at approximately of capacity and the omega pipeline is inactive 
production declines  temporary stoppages or cessations of production from wells tied into our pipelines or from our working and overriding royalty interests in wells in galveston area and high island blocks as noted above could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity if the resulting revenue declines are not offset by revenues from other sources 
due to our small size  geographically concentrated asset base and limited capital resources  any negative event has the potential to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
we are continuing our efforts to increase the utilization of our existing assets and acquire additional assets that will diversify the risks to our cash flows and be accretive to earnings 
results of operations for the year ended december  current period  we reported a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  previous period 
for the three months ended december  the current quarter  we reported a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended december  the previous quarter 
compared to revenue from pipeline operations 
revenues from pipeline operations decreased by  or  in the current period to  revenues in the current period from the blue dolphin system totaled approximately  compared to approximately  in the previous period 
daily gas volumes transported through the blue dolphin system averaged approximately mmcf of gas per day in the current period compared to approximately mmcf of gas per day in the previous period 
revenues on the ga pipeline increased by approximately  to approximately  in the current period primarily due to throughput from new shippers that commenced production in the previous period 
average daily gas volumes for ga transported increased to approximately mmcf of gas per day in the current period from approximately mmcf of gas per day in the previous period 
revenue from oil and gas sales 
revenues from oil and gas sales increased by  or  to  in the current period primarily due to increased commodity prices 
one well in high island block went off production in january and production has not been re established 
the other well in high island block produced for a portion of the current period 
these decreases in production were offset by production in the current period from high island block  which commenced production in late november of the previous period 
revenues were also affected by an increase in the realized price of natural gas 
our average realized gas price per mcf in the current period was compared to in the previous period 
the sales mix by product was gas and condensate 
our average realized price per barrel of condensate was in the current period compared to in the previous period 
revenue breakdown for the current period by field was approximately  for high island block and  for high island block pipeline operating expenses 
pipeline operating expenses decreased by  to  in the current period 
the decrease was primarily due to decreases in pipeline repair of approximately  legal fees of approximately  and compressor repair expenses of approximately  the decreases were partially offset by increases in storage tank repairs of approximately  property insurance of approximately  and bad debt expense of approximately  lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased  or in the current period to  
table of contents depletion  depreciation and amortization 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense decreased by  in the current period to  primarily due to interruption of production in the fourth quarter from damage to third party shore facilities during hurricane ike 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we recorded a full cost ceiling impairment of  for the year ended december  a variety of economic and other factors have recently caused significant declines in oil and gas prices 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting to account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities 
under this method of accounting  we are required on a quarterly basis to determine whether the book value of our oil and natural gas properties excluding unevaluated properties is less than or equal to the ceiling  based upon the expected after tax present value discounted at of the future net cash flows from our proved reserves  calculated using prevailing oil and natural gas prices on the last day of the period  or a subsequent higher price under certain circumstances 
any excess of the net book value of our oil and natural gas properties over the ceiling must be recognized as a non cash impairment expense 
our ceiling was calculated using prices of per barrel of oil and per mmbtu 
accordingly  at december   our costs exceeded our ceiling limitation  resulting in a write down of our oil and natural gas properties 
general and administrative expenses  and stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses increased  in the current period to  primarily due to increased compensation related expenses of approximately  including  of non cash stock option expense 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in legal fees of approximately  and other accounting and tax expense of approximately  interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased  in the current period due to a decrease in invested funds and the interest rate earned on those funds 
three months ended december  compared to three months ended december  revenue from pipeline operations 
revenues from pipeline operations decreased by  or  in the current quarter to  revenues in the current quarter from the blue dolphin system decreased to approximately  compared to approximately  in the previous quarter 
although daily gas volumes transported on the blue dolphin system averaged mmcf of gas per day in the current quarter  up from mmcf of gas per day in the previous quarter  lower condensate prices in the current quarter reduced our separation and storage revenue to offset the increase in gas transportation revenue 
revenues on the ga pipeline decreased to approximately  compared to approximately  in the previous quarter due to a decrease in average daily gas volumes transported of mmcf of gas per day in the current quarter from mmcf of gas per day in the previous quarter 
revenue from oil and gas sales 
revenues from oil and gas sales decreased by  or  in the current quarter primarily due to the interruption in production from high island block and high island block from damage to third party shore facilities caused by hurricane ike in september pipeline operating expenses 
pipeline operating expenses in the current quarter increased by  to  due to increases in storage tank repairs and other repairs related to damage from hurricane ike 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased in the current quarter to  due to an adjustment of expense in the previous period due to incorrect charges on a producing property 
general and administrative expenses and stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  to  in the current quarter primarily due to a decrease in stock option expense of approximately  from the previous quarter 
this decrease is partially offset by an increase of approximately  in other accounting expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance work 

table of contents depletion  depreciation and amortization 
depletion  depreciation and amortization decreased in the current quarter by  to  due to the interruption in production from high island block and high island block from damage to third party shore facilities caused by hurricane ike in september other income 
other income decreased due to a decrease in interest income of  in the current quarter 
interest income decreased because of decreases in both the amount of available funds and the interest rate earned on those funds 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash 
our primary source of cash is cash flow from operations 
during  we had negative cash flow from operations of approximate million  excluding working capital changes  mainly due to low utilization of our pipeline systems and loss of production attributable to hurricane ike 
we utilized available cash to participate in an exploratory well in high island block for a working interest for a total of million 
unfortunately  the well was determined to be non commercial and was plugged and abandoned in the third quarter of our company does not enter into any hedges or any type of derivatives to offset changes in commodity prices 
we also do not have any outstanding debt or a credit facility with a bank or institution that may restrict us from issuing debt or common stock of the company 
our current available cash is million at december  for year ended december  in millions cash flow from operations loss from operations change in current assets and liabilities total cash flow from operations cash outflows capital expenditures total cash outflows total change in cash flows in the past two years  we have used a portion of our cash reserves to fund our working capital requirements that were not funded from operations 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have changed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules at or before their adoption  and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of accounting rules is critical 
however  not all situations are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in these cases  we must use our best judgment to adopt a policy for accounting for these situations 
we accomplish this by comparatively analyzing similar situations and reviewing the accounting guidance governing them  and may consult with our independent accountants about the appropriate interpretation and application of these policies 
our most critical accounting policies currently relate to the accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  which 
table of contents include primarily our pipeline assets  as of december  and the accounting for future asset retirement costs 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we initiate a review for impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows and  should different conditions prevail or judgments be made  material impairment charges could be necessary 
currently  our pipeline assets are significantly under utilized and such underutilization is an indicator of possible impairment at december  accordingly  we developed future cash flows as of december  expected to be generated from our pipeline assets based on certain assumptions 
the most significant assumption made in connection with the preparation of expected future cash flows is that pipeline throughput volumes will increase over the next few years due to increasing current leasing and drilling activities  and prospective drilling activity surrounding our pipelines 
based on the results of the impairment test  which indicates expected future undiscounted cash flows are in excess of the pipeline assets net carrying value  no impairment has been recorded as of december  the accounting for future abandonment costs changed on january  with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted towards its future value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
future asset retirement costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our offshore platforms  pipeline systems and related onshore facilities  plugging and abandonment of wells and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our assets based upon regulatory requirements  the type of platform structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
we review our assumptions and estimates of future abandonment costs on a quarterly basis 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  effective january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the new fasb standard also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is a recognition process whereby the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  
table of contents based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted as long as the enterprise has not yet issued financial statements  including interim financial statements  in the period of adoption 
the provisions of fin are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position for that fiscal year 
the provisions of fin have been applied to all of our material tax positions taken from january  through the fiscal year ended december  we have determined that all of our material tax positions taken in our income tax returns and the positions we expect to take in our future income tax filings meet the more likely than not recognition threshold prescribed by fin in addition  we have determined that  based on our judgment  none of these tax positions meet the definition of uncertain tax positions that are subject to the non recognition criteria set forth in the new pronouncement 
fair value measurements 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp  that deferred the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a non recurring basis 
the effect of adoption of sfas for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we are assessing the impact of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose an irrevocable election to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
we did not elect the fair value option under sfas for any of our financial assets or liabilities upon adoption 
recently issued accounting pronouncements and accounting developments business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for determining how an enterprise recognizes and measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  including non controlling interests  contingent consideration  and certain acquired contingencies 
sfas r also requires acquisition related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination 
sfas r will be applicable prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period 
table of contents beginning on or after december  sfas r would have an impact on accounting for any businesses acquired after the effective date of this pronouncement 
non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
in december  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary previously referred to as minority interests 
sfas also requires that a retained non controlling interest upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at its fair value 
upon adoption of sfas  we would be required to report any non controlling interests as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we would also be required to present any net income allocable to non controlling interests and net income attributable to the stockholders of the company separately in our consolidated statements of income 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  sfas requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements of sfas shall be applied prospectively 
sfas would have an impact on the presentation and disclosure of the non controlling interests of any non wholly owned businesses acquired in the future 
hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap for nongovernmental entities 
the fasb believes that the gaap hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity not its auditor that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
this statement became effective on november  following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
revisions to the sec s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements 
on december   the sec issued the final rule  which adopts revisions to the sec s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and is effective for annual reports on forms k for years ending on or after december  early adoption of the final rule is prohibited 
the revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies 
the amendments are also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology 
revised requirements in the sec s final rule include  but are not limited to oil and gas reserves must be reported using the average price over the prior month period  rather than year end prices  companies will be allowed to report  on an optional basis  probable and possible reserves  non traditional reserves  such as oil and gas extracted from coal and shales  will be included in the definition of oil and gas producing activities  companies will be permitted to use new technologies to determine proved reserves  as long as those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions with respect to reserve volumes  companies will be required to disclose  in narrative form  additional details on their proved undeveloped reserves puds  including the total quantity of puds at year end  any material changes to puds that occurred during the year  investments and progress made to convert puds to developed oil and gas reserves and an explanation of the reasons why material concentrations of puds in individual fields or countries have remained undeveloped for five years or more after disclosure as puds  companies will be required to report the qualifications and measures taken to assure the independence 
table of contents and objectivity of any business entity or employee primarily responsible for preparing or auditing the reserves estimates 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting the final rule 
the sec is discussing the final rule with the fasb staff to align fasb accounting standards with the new sec rules 
these discussions may delay the required compliance date 
absent any change in the effective date  we will begin complying with the disclosure requirements in its annual report on form k for the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk none
