other expenses net 
interest expense increased by million in fiscal to million  compared to interest expense of million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to an increase in the company s debt financing arrangements in connection with the acquisitions of rocawear  official pillowtex and starter  as well as interest related to our judgment against herbert guez and ads

provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal is approximately resulting in the million income tax expense 
this difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate of  is mainly driven by the benefit in state income taxes and relates to fluctuations in state rates expected to be realized by the company due to new or revised tax legislation as well as changes we have recently experienced in the level of business performed within specific tax jurisdictions

net income

liquidity and capital resources liquidity our principal capital requirements have been to fund acquisitions  working capital needs  and to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
we have historically relied on internally generated funds to finance our operations and our primary source of capital needs for acquisition has been the issuance of debt and equity securities 
at december  and  our cash totaled million and million  respectively  including short term restricted cash of million and million  respectively 
on october   we completed our acquisition of waverly for million in cash paid to the sellers  funded entirely from cash on hand 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on this acquisition 
the term loan facility requires us to repay the principal amount of the term loan outstanding in an amount equal to of the excess cash flow of the subsidiaries subject to the term loan facility for the most recently completed fiscal year 
for the year ended december   we will repay million of the principal balance  which represents of the excess cash flow of the subsidiaries subject to the term loan facility 
this amount is now included in the current portion of long term debt 
we believe that cash from future operations as well as currently available cash will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we intend to continue financing future brand acquisitions through a combination of cash from operations  bank financing and the issuance of additional equity and or debt securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of certain prior financings consummated by us 
as of december   our marketable securities consist of auction rate securities 
beginning in the third quarter of  million of our auction rate securities had failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these funds will not be available to us until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found outside the auction process 
as a result  million of auction rate securities have been written down to million  using level inputs with present value techniques as described by the fair value hierarchy and the income approach outlined in sfas  as an unrealized pre tax loss of million to reflect a temporary decrease in fair value 
as the write down of million has been identified as a temporary decrease in fair value  the write down has not impacted our earnings and is reflected as an other comprehensive loss in the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet 
we estimated the fair value of our auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model where we used the expected rate of interest to be received 
we believe this decrease in fair value is temporary due to general macroeconomic market conditions  and interest is being paid in full as scheduled 
further  we have the ability to hold the securities until an anticipated full redemption  and we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of these auction rate securities or its third party insurers are presently at risk of default 
we believe our cash flow from future operations and its existing cash on hand will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  regardless of the timeliness of the auction process

eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management is evaluating the impact adopting this staff position will have on the company s results of operations and financial position critical accounting policies several of the company s accounting policies involve management judgments and estimates that could be significant 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position include the estimate of reserves to provide for collectability of accounts receivable 
the company estimates the collectability considering historical  current and anticipated trends of its licensees related to deductions taken by customers and markdowns provided to retail customers to effectively flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of its licensees and their retail customers 
due to its licensing model  the company has eliminated its inventory risk and reduced its operating risks  and can now reasonably forecast revenues and plan expenditures based upon guaranteed royalty minimums and sales projections provided by its retail licensees 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period

in connection with its licensing model  the company has entered into various trademark license agreements that provide revenues based on minimum royalties and additional revenues based on a percentage of defined sales 
minimum royalty revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over each period  as defined  in each license agreement 
royalties exceeding the defined minimum amounts are recognized as income during the period corresponding to the licensee s sales

 goodwill and other intangible assets  herein referred to as sfas no 
 which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon the company s adoption of sfas no 
on february   the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
as prescribed under sfas no 
 the company had goodwill tested for impairment during the years ended december   and  and no write downs from impairments were necessary 
the company s tests for impairment utilize discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair values of the individual assets 
assumptions critical to the company s fair value estimates are as follow i discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair value of the reporting units and trademarks  ii royalty rates used in our trade mark valuations  iii projected average revenue growth rates used in the reporting unit and trademark models  and iv projected long term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values 
these tests factor in economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
impairment losses are recognized for long lived assets  including certain intangibles  used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amount 
for the years ended december    and there was no impairment present for these long lived assets

 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized

the company adopted fasb interepretation  herein referred to as fin  beginning january  the implementation of fin did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the total unrecognized tax benefit was million at the date of adoption 
at december   the total unrecognized tax benefit was million 
however  the liability is not recognized for accounting purposes because the related deferred tax asset has been fully reserved in prior years 
the company is continuing its practice of recognizing interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
there was no accrual for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for the year ended december  the company files federal and state tax returns and is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for fiscal years prior to marketable securities  which are accounted for as available for sale  are stated at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and consist of auction rate securities 
temporary changes in fair market value are recorded as other comprehensive income or loss  whereas other than temporary markdowns will be realized through the company s statement of operations 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurement 
while sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements in its application to other accounting pronouncements  it does emphasize that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company limits exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by requiring substantially all of its licenses to be denominated in us dollars 
the company is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   the company had approximately million in variable interest debt under its term loan facility 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
to mitigate interest rate risks  the company is utilizing derivative financial instruments such as interest rate hedges to convert certain portions of the company s variable rate debt to fixed interest rates 
if there were an adverse change of in interest rates  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial 
the company invested in certain auction rate securities 
during the year ended december   our balance of auction rate securities failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these funds will not be available to us until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found outside the auction process 
as a result  million of auction rate securities were written down to million as an unrealized pre tax loss of million to reflect a temporary decrease in fair value 
the company estimated the fair value of its auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model where the company used the expected rate of interest to be received 
the company believes this decrease in fair value is temporary due to general macroeconomic market conditions  and interest is being paid in full as scheduled 
further  the company has the ability to hold the securities until an anticipated full redemption  and the company has no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of these auction rate securities or its third party insurers are presently at risk of default 
as the write down of approximately million has been identified as a temporary decrease in fair value  the write down did not impact the company s earnings and is reflected as an other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
the cumulative effect of the failure to auction since the third quarter of fiscal has resulted in an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million which is reflected in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with the initial sale of its convertible notes  the company entered into convertible note hedges with the counterparties  which hedging transactions are expected  but are not guaranteed  to eliminate the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes 
at the same time  the company entered into sold warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties 
in connection with such transactions  the hedge counterparties entered into various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to the company s common stock and purchased the company s common stock  and they may enter into or unwind various over the counter derivatives and or purchase or sell the company s common stock in secondary market transactions in the future 
such activities could have the effect of increasing  or preventing a decline in  the price of our common stock 
such effect is expected to be greater in the event we elect to settle converted notes entirely in cash 
the hedge counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible notes or termination of the transactions by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock  other of our securities  or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging 
in particular  such hedging modification may occur during any conversion reference period for a conversion of notes 
in addition  we intend to exercise options we hold under the convertible note hedge transactions whenever notes are converted and we have elected  with respect to such conversion  to pay a portion of the consideration then due by us to the note holder in shares of our common stock 
in order to unwind their hedge positions with respect to those exercised options  the hedge counterparties will likely sell shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions or unwind various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during the conversion reference period for the converted notes 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
also  the sold warrant transaction could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants
