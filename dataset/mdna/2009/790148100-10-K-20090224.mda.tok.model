overview we believe we have one of the largest inventories of private land suitable for development in florida 
the majority of our land is located in northwest florida and has a very low cost basis 
in order to optimize the value of these core real estate assets  we seek to reposition our substantial timberland holdings for higher and better uses 
we seek to create value in our land by securing entitlements for higher and better land uses  facilitating infrastructure improvements  developing community amenities  undertaking strategic and expert land planning and development  parceling our land holdings in creative ways and performing land restoration and enhancement 
we have four operating segments residential real estate  commercial real estate  rural land sales and forestry 
our residential real estate segment generates revenues from the sale of developed homesites to retail customers and builders  the sale of parcels of entitled  undeveloped land  the sale of housing units built by us  resort and club operations  rental income  and brokerage fees on certain transactions within our residential real estate developments 
our commercial real estate segment generates revenues from the sale of developed and undeveloped land for retail  multi family  office and industrial uses 
our rural land sales segment generates revenues from the sale of parcels of undeveloped land and rural land with limited development 
our forestry segment generates revenues from the sale of pulpwood  timber and forest products and conservation land management services 
for over three years  the united states has experienced a dramatic slowdown in most of its residential real estate markets 
florida  as one of the fastest growing states during the preceding real estate boom  has been particularly hard hit  with high levels of inventories of resale homes  a large number of foreclosures and steep declines in home values 
in  the problems in the real estate industry contributed to a liquidity crisis among financial institutions resulting in unprecedented government intervention  a dramatic drop in the stock market and the onset of a severe economic recession 
the financial markets remain unsettled and economic conditions continue to deteriorate  exerting additional negative pressure on real estate demand and consumer confidence  thereby prolonging the possibility of any real estate recovery 
as a result of these adverse conditions  our residential and commercial sales have declined precipitously since during and  we relied on rural land sales as a significant source of revenues due to the continuing downturn in our residential and commercial real estate markets 
demand for our rural land remains steady  and we expect to continue to rely on rural land sales as a significant source of revenues in the future  although to a lesser extent than and we are carefully monitoring  however  any impact that the current economic environment may have on pricing or overall demand for rural land 
in addition to our large inventory of rural land  we have virtually no debt and significant cash reserves 
we have also greatly reduced our capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses 
as a result  we believe that we are well positioned to withstand the current challenging environment 
meanwhile  we are continuing to develop the strategic relationships that will benefit our business when the economy and our markets recover 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical and current experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
additionally  we evaluate the results of these estimates on an on going basis 
management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales 
costs associated with a specific real estate project are capitalized once we determine that the project is economically probable 
we capitalize costs directly associated with development and construction of identified real estate projects 
indirect costs that clearly relate to a specific project under development  such as internal costs of a regional project field office  are also capitalized 
we capitalize interest up to total interest expense based on the amount of underlying expenditures and real estate taxes on real estate projects under development 
if we determine not to complete a project  any previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period such determination is made 
real estate inventory costs include land and common development costs such as roads  sewers and amenities  multi family construction costs  capitalized property taxes  capitalized interest and certain indirect costs 
construction costs for single family homes are determined based upon actual costs incurred 
a portion of real estate inventory costs and estimates for costs to complete are allocated to each unit based on the relative sales value of each unit as compared to the estimated sales value of the total project 
these estimates are reevaluated at least annually  and more frequently if warranted by market conditions or other factors  with any adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining units available for sale 
the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation is susceptible to change due to the use of assumptions about future sales proceeds and related real estate expenditures 
management s assumptions about future housing and homesite sales prices  sales volume and sales velocity require significant judgment because the real estate market is cyclical and highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
in addition  actual results could differ from management s estimates due to changes in anticipated development  construction and overhead costs 
until we had not made significant adjustments affecting real estate gross profit margins  there can be no assurances  however  that estimates used to generate future real estate gross profit margins will not differ from our current estimates 
revenue recognition percentage of completion 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  revenue for multi family residences under construction is recognized using the percentage of completion method when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for nondelivery of the unit  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  sales price is assured  and aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is then recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
percentage of completion accounting is also used for our homesite sales when required development is not complete at the time of sale and for commercial and other land sales if there are uncompleted development costs yet to be incurred for the property sold 
our townhomes are attached residences sold individually along with the underlying parcel of land 
revenues and cost of sales for our townhomes are accounted for using the full accrual method 
these units differ from multi family units  in which buyers hold title to a unit or fractional share of a unit within a building and an interest in the underlying land held in common with other building association members 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine that an impairment exists due to the inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 
if such assets were held for sale  the provision for loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value less costs to sell 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as i analyzing expected future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
the fair value determined under these methods can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of our markets  demand for real estate and the projected net operating income for a specific property 
goodwill is carried at the lower of cost or fair value and is tested for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted  by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of each reporting unit with goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and estimates including estimating discounted future cash flows  net operating income  future economic conditions  fair value of assets held and discount rates 
if this comparison indicates that the goodwill of a particular reporting unit is impaired  the aggregate fair value of each of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are compared to the fair value of the reporting unit to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
intangible assets 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective fair values  using customary estimates of fair value  including data from appraisals  comparable sales  discounted cash flow analysis and other methods 
these fair values can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors and estimates  including changes in the general economy of our markets  demand for real estate  lease terms  amortization periods and fair market values assigned to leases as well as fair value assigned to customer relationships 
fair value measurement  we partially adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  on january  sfas  among other things  defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
sfas clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  sfas establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
we currently record assets within level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
assets utilizing level inputs include investments in money market and short term treasury instruments 
assets utilizing level inputs include our retained interest in qualified special purpose entities qspes 
we have recorded a retained interest with respect to the monetization of certain installment notes through the use of qspes 
our continuing involvement with the qspes is in the form of receipts of net interest payments  which are recorded as interest income 
in addition  we will receive the payment of the remaining principal on the installment notes associated with our qspes at the end of their year maturity period 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securities and financial assets  we recognize interest income over the life of the retained interest using the effective yield method 
this income is being recorded as an offset to unrealized loss 
table of contents on monetization of notes over the life of the installment notes 
in addition  fair value is adjusted at each reporting date when  based on management s assessment of current information and events  there is a favorable or adverse change in estimated cash flows from cash flows previously projected 
pension plan 
we sponsor a cash balance defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of our employees 
currently  our pension plan is over funded and contributes income to the company 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by specialized accounting and actuarial methods using numerous estimates  including discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages  and future salary increases 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension plan s impact on the financial statements of the company 
for example  in  a increase in the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets would have resulted in a million increase in pre tax income million net of tax 
a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would have caused an equivalent decrease in pre tax income 
a increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would have resulted in a million change in pre tax income 
our pension plan is currently overfunded  and accordingly  generated income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  the funded status of our pension plan decreased to million from million in primarily as a result of recent stock market volatility 
although we do not expect to make contributions to the pension plan in the near future  further significant volatility in the markets could potentially reduce our funded status and possibly require us to make a contribution to the plan 
stock based compensation 
during the first quarter of  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is typically recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we elected the modified prospective method of adoption  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new grants and grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified 
estimated compensation for the unvested portion of grants that were outstanding as of the effective date is being recognized over the remaining service period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors term of option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by incorporating the contractual term of the options and analyzing employees actual and expected exercise behaviors 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using historical volatility in market price over a period consistent with the expected term  and other factors 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model on us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we use an estimated dividend yield in the option valuation model when dividends are anticipated 
in february  under our stock incentive plan  we granted select executives and other key employees restricted stock awards with vesting based upon the achievement of certain market conditions that are defined as our total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder return of certain peer groups during the performance period 
we currently use a monte carlo simulation pricing model to determine the fair value of our market condition awards 
the determination of the fair value of market condition based awards is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the relative performance of our stock price and shareholder returns compared to those companies in our peer groups and a risk free interest rate assumption 
compensation 
table of contents cost is recognized regardless of the achievement of the market condition  provided the requisite service period is met 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon our analysis of the timing and reversal of future taxable amounts and our history and future expectations of taxable income 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period we will include the adjustments in the tax provision in our financial statements 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position  cash flow and results of operation 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes of approximately million which are available to offset future state taxable income  if any  through at december   we recorded a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets of approximately million  as we believe it is more likely than not that it will not be fully realized due to the shorter term nature of certain carryforward items 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp sfas r  employer s disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
this fsp amends fasb statement no 
 employer s disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  to disclose more information about investment allocation decisions  major categories of plan assets  including concentrations of risk and fair value measurements  and the fair value techniques and inputs used to measure plan assets 
the disclosures required by this fsp are required to be provided for fiscal years ending after december  we are in the process of evaluating the effect  if any  the adoption of this fsp will have on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this fsp holds that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities as defined in eitf and therefore should be included in computing earnings per share using the two class method 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  when this fsp is adopted  its requirements will be applied by recasting previously reported earnings per share data 
we are in the process of evaluating the effect  if any  the adoption of this fsp will have on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities  including a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we do not believe sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements arb 
sfas amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest previously referred to as minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity  not as a liability  in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated statement of operations  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
the statement also establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of evaluating the effect the adoption of this fsp will have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their full fair values as of that date 
sfas r is effective for business combinations occurring after december  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
it applies to other accounting pronouncements where the fasb requires or permits fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fsp no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas for certain non financial assets and non financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
non financial assets and liabilities include pension plan assets related to the funded status of our pension plan  goodwill  investment in real estate  intangible assets with indefinite lives  guarantees and certain other items 
we adopted sfas for financial assets and liabilities on january  the partial adoption of sfas  as it relates to financial assets and liabilities  did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial position  other than additional disclosures 
we have deferred the adoption of sfas with regards to non financial assets and liabilities in accordance with fsp no 
we are in the process of evaluating the effect of the full adoption of the remaining portions of sfas no

results of operations consolidated results the following table sets forth a comparison of our revenues and expenses for the three years ended december  years ended december  vs 
vs 
difference change difference change dollars in millions revenues real estate sales rental revenues timber sales other revenues total expenses cost of real estate sales cost of rental revenues cost of timber sales cost of other revenues other operating expenses total the overall decrease in real estate sales revenues in compared to was primarily due to the continued decrease in sales demand and pricing in our residential and commercial real estate segments 
our gross margin percentage on real estate sales increased during compared to primarily as a result of a 
table of contents change in mix to higher margin rural land sales 
other operating expenses decreased in compared to due to lower general and administrative expenses as a result of our restructuring efforts 
the decreases in real estate sales revenue and cost of real estate sales for compared to were primarily due to lower sales volume and prices in our residential real estate segment as a result of the slowdown in the real estate market  partially offset by increases in rural land sales 
despite these decreases  our gross margin percentage on real estate sales increased during compared to primarily as a result of a change in mix to higher margin rural land sales 
other operating expenses increased in due to a million termination fee paid to a third party management company in our residential real estate segment  partially offset by lower administrative costs in our rural land sales segment 
for further detailed discussion of revenues and expenses  see segment results below 
corporate expense 
corporate expense  representing corporate general and administrative expenses  increased million  or  to million in over lower payroll related costs in attributable to staffing reductions were offset by additional deferred compensation expense 
during early  we granted certain members of management shares of restricted stock with vesting conditions based on our performance over a three year period 
we recognized approximately million of additional expense related to these grants during we expect to incur future expense associated with additional equity grants going forward 
in addition  corporate expense included a pension expense of million related to settlement and curtailment charges in connection with the termination of employees 
corporate expense decreased million  or  to million in over the decrease was partially due to a decrease in total stock compensation costs of million 
total stock compensation decreased because the period included the accelerated amortization of restricted stock related to the retirement of a former officer  and there were fewer overall equity plan participants and unvested outstanding stock options in other general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million during compared to primarily as a result of the completion of our marketing program  reduced litigation costs and overall cost savings initiatives 
impairment losses 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
our goodwill originated from the acquisition of certain assets of arvida company and its affiliates 
we perform an annual year end assessment  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
an impairment is considered to exist if fair value is less than the carrying amount of the assets  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of the reporting segment and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
during our year end assessment  we determined that our remaining goodwill was not recoverable based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
accordingly  an impairment charge of million was recorded in the residential real estate segment 
in addition  we performed an impairment analysis related to our intangible assets and determined no adjustment was required at december  we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
homes and homesites substantially completed and ready for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
for projects under development  an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis is performed using estimated future expenditures necessary to maintain and complete the existing project and using management s best estimates about future sales prices and holding periods 
the continued decline in demand and market prices for residential real estate during caused us to evaluate certain carrying amounts within our residential real estate segment 

table of contents as a result of our property impairment analyses  we recorded aggregate impairment charges in our residential real estate segment of million during in addition  we recorded a charge of million related to the write down of a renegotiated builder note receivable during as a result of our third quarter impairment analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the residential real estate segment 
we announced on october  our plan to dispose of sunshine state cypress as part of a restructuring plan 
our estimate of its fair value based upon market analysis indicated that goodwill would not be recoverable 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of in our forestry segment to reduce the goodwill carrying value of sunshine state cypress to zero 
in  we also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the impairment charges related to sunshine state cypress are reported as part of our discontinued operations 
we also recorded an impairment charge of million to approximate fair value  less costs to sell  related to our investment in saussy burbank which was sold in  which is also reported as part of our and discontinued operations 
restructuring charges

total other expense income was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased million during compared to  primarily as a result of our reduced debt levels 
interest expense increased million during compared to primarily as a result of an increase in average borrowings in  as well as less capitalized interest 
during we recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt which consisted of million related to the write off of unamortized loan costs on our prior credit facility and million in connection with the prepayment of our senior notes 
the senior note costs included a million make whole payment and million of unamortized loan costs  net of accrued interest 
other  net decreased million in compared to primarily due to recording a loss of million related to the fair value adjustment of our retained interest in monetized installment note receivables and million related to the write off of net book value on abandoned property 
these decreases were offset by the receipt in of a million insurance settlement related to the defense of an outstanding litigation matter 
included in is a charge of million related to the fair value adjustment of the retained interest in monetized installment note receivables and a million contractor settlement within our residential segment

segment results residential real estate our residential real estate segment develops large scale  mixed use resort  primary and seasonal residential communities  primarily on our existing land 
we own large tracts of land in northwest florida  including significant gulf of mexico beach frontage and waterfront properties  and land near jacksonville  in deland and near tallahassee 
our residential sales have declined precipitously from to due to the collapse of the housing markets in florida 
inventories of resale homes and homesites remain high in our markets and prices have declined 
with the us and florida economies battling rising foreclosures  severely restrictive credit  significant inventories of unsold homes and worsening economic conditions  predicting when real estate markets will return to health remains difficult 
currently  we do not expect any significant favorable change in these trends during in  we recorded goodwill in our residential real estate segment in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of arvida company and its affiliates 
based on the continued worsening of the residential real estate markets in we have now determined that the remaining goodwill related to this acquisition is not recoverable based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
accordingly  an impairment of million was 
table of contents recorded in the residential real estate segment in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill to zero 
homes and homesites substantially completed and ready for sale are measured at lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
for projects under development  an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis is performed 
the overall decrease in demand and market prices for residential real estate indicated that certain carrying amounts within our residential real estate segment may not be recoverable 
as a result of our impairment analyses for  we recorded aggregate impairment charges of million  consisting of million related to completed homes in several communities  million related to our sevenshores condominium project  and million related to the write down of a renegotiated builder note receivable 
the seven shores condominium project was written down in the fourth quarter of to approximate the fair market value of land entitled for condominium units 
this write down was necessary because we elected not to exercise our option to acquire additional land under our option agreement 
certain costs had previously been incurred with the expectation that the project would include units 
given the reduced potential scope of the project  we do not believe that those costs are recoverable 
in we recorded impairments totaling million due to the adverse market conditions for residential real estate 
approximately million of the impairments related to capitalized costs at certain projects due to changes in development plans  approximately million related primarily to the reduction in market value of completed spec homes in several communities and approximately million related to the modified terms of certain promissory notes 
currently  customers for our developed homesites include both individual purchasers and national  regional and local homebuilders 
many of these homebuilders are also experiencing financial difficulties during this current weak real estate market 
as a result  some of these homebuilders are choosing to delay or forego purchasing additional homesites  and some have cancelled existing purchase commitments with us  or have sought to renegotiate such commitments on more favorable terms

as discussed earlier  three of the buildings have been reported in continuing operations and the remaining have been reported in discontinued operations 
considering the significant increase in office building valuations in the years prior to the sale  we believe that we achieved optimum pricing for our office building portfolio  especially in light of the subsequent decline in the market for commercial office buildings 
we have no current plans to acquire additional office buildings

demand for our rural land remains steady  and we expect to continue to rely on rural land sales as a significant source of revenues in the future  although to a lesser extent than in and we are carefully monitoring  however  any impact that the current economic environment may have on pricing or overall demand for rural land

our estimate of fair value based upon market analysis indicated that its goodwill would not be recoverable
