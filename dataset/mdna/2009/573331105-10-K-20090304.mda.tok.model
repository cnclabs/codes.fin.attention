risk factors risks related to our business 
overview we are a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the united states gulf coast region 
our four primary business lines include terminalling and storage services for petroleum products and by products  natural gas services  marine transportation services for petroleum products and by products  and sulfur and sulfur based products processing  manufacturing  marketing and distribution 
the petroleum products and by products we collect  transport  store and distribute are produced primarily by major and independent oil and gas companies who often turn to third parties  such as us  for the transportation and disposition of these products 
in addition to these major and independent oil and gas companies  our primary customers include independent refiners  large chemical companies  fertilizer manufacturers and other wholesale purchasers of these products 
we operate primarily in the gulf coast region of the united states 
this region is a major hub for petroleum refining  natural gas gathering and processing and support services to the exploration and production industry 
developments and subsequent events recent acquisitions acquisition of martin resource management stanolind assets 
in january  we acquired acres of land  a deep water dock and two sulfuric acid tanks at our stanolind terminal in beaumont  from martin resource management 
in connection with this acquisition  we entered into a lease agreement with martin resource management for use of the sulfuric acid tanks 
other developments quarterly distribution 
we declared a quarterly cash distribution for the fourth quarter of of per common and subordinated unit on january   reflecting no change over the quarterly distribution paid in respect of the third quarter of conversion of subordinated units 
on november    of our  outstanding subordinated units owned by martin resource management through a subsidiary converted into common units on a one for one basis following our quarterly cash distribution on such date 
additional conversions of our outstanding subordinated units may occur in the future provided that certain distribution thresholds contained in our partnership agreement are met by us 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
we prepared these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our results may differ from these estimates 
currently  we believe that our accounting policies do not require us to make estimates using assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain 
however  we have described below the critical accounting policies that we believe could impact our consolidated financial statements most significantly 
you should also read note  significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
some of the more significant estimates in these financial statements include the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and the determination of the fair value of our reporting units under the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  all derivatives and hedging instruments are included on the balance sheet as an asset or liability measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value can be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
in early  we adopted a hedging policy that allows us to use hedge accounting for financial transactions that are designated as hedges 
derivative instruments not designated as hedges are being marked to market with all market value adjustments being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we had designated a portion of our derivative instruments as qualifying cash flow hedges 
fair value changes for these hedges have been recorded in other comprehensive income as a component of equity 
product exchanges we enter into product exchange agreements with third parties whereby we agree to exchange ngls and sulfur with third parties 
we record the balance of ngls and sulfur due to other companies under these agreements at quoted market product prices and the balance of ngls and sulfur due from other companies at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
revenue recognition revenue for our four operating segments is recognized as follows terminalling and storage revenue is recognized for storage contracts based on the contracted monthly tank fixed fee 
for throughput contracts  revenue is recognized based on the volume moved through our terminals at the contracted rate 
when lubricants and drilling fluids are sold by truck  revenue is recognized upon delivering product to the customers as title to the product transfers when the customer physically receives the product 
natural gas services natural gas gathering and processing revenues are recognized when title passes or service is performed 
ngl distribution revenue is recognized when product is delivered by truck to our ngl customers  which occurs when the customer physically receives the product 
when product is sold in storage  or by pipeline  we recognize ngl distribution revenue when the customer receives the product from either the storage facility or pipeline 
marine transportation revenue is recognized for contracted trips upon completion of the particular trip 
for time charters  revenue is recognized based on a per day rate 
sulfur services revenue is recognized when the customer takes title to the product  either at our plant or the customer facility 
equity method investments we use the equity method of accounting for investments in unconsolidated entities where the ability to exercise significant influence over such entities exists 
investments in unconsolidated entities consist of capital contributions and advances plus our share of accumulated earnings as of the entities latest fiscal year ends  less capital withdrawals and distributions 
investments in excess of the underlying net assets of equity method investees  specifically identifiable to property  plant and equipment  are amortized over the useful life of the related assets 
excess investment representing equity method goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment  annually 
under the provisions of sfas  this goodwill is not subject to amortization and is accounted for as a component of the investment 
equity method investments are subject to impairment under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
no portion of the net income from these entities is included in our operating income 
following our acquisition of prism gas in november  we own an unconsolidated interest in waskom  matagorda  and pipe 
as a result  these assets are accounted for by the equity method and we do not include any portion of their net income in operating income 

table of contents on june   we  through prism gas  acquired a ownership interest in a partnership which owns the lease rights to the assets of the bcp 
this interest is accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
the lease contract expires in june and an extension is not currently contemplated 
goodwill goodwill is subject to a fair value based impairment test on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
we are required to identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units  it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition  and all of the activities within a reporting unit  whether acquired or organically grown  are available to support value of the goodwill 
we performed the annual impairment tests as of september   september  and september   respectively 
in performing such tests  we determined we had four reporting units which contained goodwill 
these reporting units were in each of our four reporting segments terminalling  natural gas services  marine transportation  and sulfur services 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units with goodwill were developed using the guideline public company method  the guideline transaction method  and the discounted cash flow dcf method using observable market data where available 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we would be required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
at september   and the estimated fair value of each of our four reporting units was in excess of its carrying value resulting in no impairment 
as a result of the deterioration in the overall stock market subsequent to september  and the decline in our unit price  we reviewed specific factors  as outlined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 to determine if we had a trigging event that required us to test our goodwill for impairment as of december  these factors included whether there have been any significant fundamental changes since our annual impairment test to i our business as a whole or to the reporting units  including regulatory changes  ii our level of operating cash flows  iii our expectation of future levels of operating cash flows  iv our executive management team  and v the carrying value of our other long lived assets 
while these factors did not indicate a triggering event occurred  our unit price fell to a point by december   that resulted in our total market capitalization being less than our partner s equity 
we determined this to be a triggering event requiring us to perform an impairment test as of december  as a result of our goodwill impairment test for each of the four reporting units as of december   no impairment was determined to exist 
environmental liabilities we have historically not experienced circumstances requiring us to account for environmental remediation obligations 
if such circumstances arise  we would estimate remediation obligations utilizing a remediation feasibility study and any other related environmental studies that we may elect to perform 
we would record changes to our estimated environmental liability as circumstances change or events occur  such as the issuance of revised orders by governmental bodies or court or other judicial orders and our evaluation of the likelihood and amount of the related eventual liability 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record both specific and general reserves for bad debts to reduce the related receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers 
asset retirement obligation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations and fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  an interpretation of sfas  we recognize and measure our asset retirement obligations and the associated asset retirement cost upon acquisition of the related asset 
subsequent measurement and accounting provisions are in accordance with sfas we have recognized asset retirement obligations  where appropriate 

table of contents reclassifications as previously reported in our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended september   which was filed with the sec on november   we converted to a new accounting system in august in connection with the system conversion  we closely examined expense classifications under the new system 
upon review  it was determined that certain payroll  property insurance and property tax expenses that were previously categorized as selling  general and administrative expenses would be more appropriately classified as operating expenses or costs of products sold 
as a result  those expenses were set up in the new system with the new classification 
accordingly  it is necessary for us to reclassify the related expense items for fiscal year since the reclassifications  as indicated in the tables set forth below  had no impact on the prior periods revenues  operating income  cash flows from operations or net income  we have determined that the reclassifications are not material to our audited financial statements for the prior periods 
nonetheless  we are effecting the reclassifications for prior periods in order to provide comparative clarity and consistency for the annual period when compared to our financial reporting for our current fiscal year 
the following table sets forth the effects of the reclassifications on certain line items within our previously reported consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  dollars in thousands  which statements of income and certain relevant footnotes thereto as well as the relevant portions of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for those periods have been updated

table of contents interest expense our interest expense for all operations was million for compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding offset by a decrease in interest rates throughout compared to which also included a debt prepayment premium of million 
also  we had non cash mark to market charges of million which increased interest expense in indirect selling  general and administrative expenses indirect selling  general and administrative expenses were million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
martin resource management allocated to us a portion of its indirect selling  general and administrative expenses for services such as accounting  treasury  clerical billing  information technology  administration of insurance  engineering  general office expense and employee benefit plans and other general corporate overhead functions we share with martin resource management retained businesses 
this allocation is based on the percentage of time spent by martin resource management personnel that provide such centralized services 
generally accepted accounting principles also permit other methods for allocation of these expenses  such as basing the allocation on the percentage of revenues contributed by a segment 
the allocation of these expenses between martin resource management and us is subject to a number of judgments and estimates  regardless of the method used 
we can provide no assurances that our method of allocation  in the past or in the future  is or will be the most accurate or appropriate method of allocation these expenses 
other methods could result in a higher allocation of selling  general and administrative expense to us  which would reduce our net income 
under the omnibus agreement  we are required to reimburse martin resource management for indirect general and administrative and corporate overhead expenses 
the amount of this reimbursement was capped at million through november  when the cap expired 
for both the years ended december  and  the conflicts committee of our general partner approved reimbursement amounts of million reflecting our allocable share of such expenses 
the conflicts committee will review and approve future adjustments in the reimbursement amount for indirect expenses  if any  annually 
liquidity and capital resources impact of current economic crisis we believe that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated maintenance capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments in however  current economic conditions  including wide fluctuations in commodity prices and deteriorating credit markets  have created constraints on liquidity within the capital markets and the ability to obtain credit in the markets 
due to restrictions on liquidity within the capital markets and existing litigation at martin resource managment see item b 
other information we expect our ability to access the capital markets to remain constrained over the next twelve months 
our near term focus is to ensure we have sufficient liquidity to fund our growth programs  while continuing the present distribution rate to our unitholders 
the current economic crisis has created a challenging operating environment for us to maintain our liquidity and operating cash flows at levels consistent with the recent past while maintaining the present distribution rate to our unitholders 
we continue to evaluate our liquidity and capital resources and may consider sales of non performing or non core assets for additional liquidity 
we intend to move forward with our commercially supported internal growth projects 
our ability to access the capital markets to fund new projects in the future at prices that make the proposed projects accretive is likely to be limited 
we may revise the timing and scope of other projects as necessary to adapt to existing economic conditions and the incremental benefits expected to accrue to our unitholders from our expansion activities are likely to be decreased by substantial cost of capital increases during this period 
in addition  if there is need to access the credit markets and the credit markets do not improve  we cannot assure you that we would be able to secure additional financing if needed  and  if such funds were available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us 
finally  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements  to fund planned capital expenditures and to satisfy our debt service obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which is subject to certain risks 
for example  the impact of the current economic crisis may significantly affect our customers  including their ability to satisfy receivables owed to us on a timely basis

if martin resource management no longer controls our general partner  the lenders under our credit facility may declare all amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable 
in addition  an event of default by martin resource management under its credit facility could independently result in an event of default under our credit facility if it is deemed to have a material adverse effect on us 
any event of default and corresponding acceleration of outstanding balances under our credit facility could require us to refinance such indebtedness on unfavorable terms and would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to make distributions to unitholders

as of march   our outstanding indebtedness includes million under our credit facility 
seasonality a substantial portion of our revenues are dependent on sales prices of products  particularly ngls and sulfur based fertilizer products  which fluctuate in part based on winter and spring weather conditions 
the demand for ngls is strongest during the winter heating season 
the demand for fertilizers is strongest during the early spring planting season 
however  our terminalling and storage and marine transportation businesses and the molten sulfur business are typically not impacted by seasonal fluctuations 
we expect to derive approximately half of our net income from our terminalling and storage  marine transportation  natural gas and sulfur businesses 
therefore  we do not expect that our overall net income will be impacted by seasonality factors 
however  extraordinary weather events  such as hurricanes  have in the past  and could in the future  impact our terminalling and storage and marine transportation businesses 
for example  hurricanes gustav and ike in the third quarter of and hurricanes katrina and rita in the third quarter of adversely impacted our operating expenses and adversely impacted our terminalling and storage and marine transportation business s revenues 

table of contents impact of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations in  and however  inflation remains a factor in the united states economy and could increase our cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment as well as our labor and supply costs 
we cannot assure our unitholders that we will be able to pass along increased costs to our customers 
increasing energy prices could adversely affect our results of operations 
diesel fuel  natural gas  chemicals and other supplies are recorded in operating expenses 
an increase in price of these products would increase our operating expenses which could adversely affect net income 
we cannot assure our unitholders that we will be able to pass along increased operating expenses to our customers

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  counterparty credit and interest rates 
historically  we have not engaged in commodity contract trading or hedging activities 
however  in connection with our acquisition of prism gas  we have established a hedging policy 
for the year ended december   changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts were recorded both in earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income aoci since we have designated a portion of our derivative instruments as hedges as of december  commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  counterparty credit and interest rates 
historically  we have not engaged in commodity contract trading or hedging activities 
under our hedging policy  we monitor and manage the commodity market risk associated with our commodity risk exposure 
in addition  we are focusing on utilizing counterparties for these transactions whose financial condition is appropriate for the credit risk involved in each specific transaction 
we use derivatives to manage the risk of commodity price fluctuations 
our counterparties to the commodity derivative contracts include shell energy north america us  lp  morgan stanley capital group inc and wachovia bank 
on all transactions where we are exposed to counterparty risk  we analyze the counterparty s financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  and have established a maximum credit limit threshold pursuant to our hedging policy and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis 
currently  we have entered into these derivative transactions with an investment grade subsidiary of a major oil company and investment grade banks 
while we anticipate that future derivative transactions will be entered into with investment grade counterparties  and that we will actively monitor the credit rating of such counterparties  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
such risks may be more likely due to the worldwide financial and credit crisis 
we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of natural gas  ngls and condensate as a result of gathering  processing and sales activities 
gathering and processing revenues are earned under various contractual arrangements with gas producers 
gathering revenues are generated through a combination of fixed fee and index related arrangements 
processing revenues are generated primarily through contracts which provide for processing on pol and pop basis 
prism gas has entered into hedging transactions through to protect a portion of its commodity exposure from these contracts 
these hedging arrangements are in the form of swaps for crude oil  natural gas  and natural gasoline 

table of contents in october  we elected to discontinue hedge accounting treatment for certain crude oil derivative contracts 
the impact to the consolidated statement of operations was a mark to market gain of million for the year ended december  in december  we terminated three commodity swap agreements resulting in a cash receipt from the counterparty of million 
these swap agreements were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as a result of the termination  a gain of million was recorded to the partnership s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as a result of declining commodity prices  we determined that continued reporting of losses in aoci for certain commodity hedges would lead to recognizing a net loss on the combination of the hedging instrument and the hedge transaction in future periods 
accordingly  the calculated loss of million was immediately classified into earnings 
the remaining deferred gains of million and deferred losses of million pertaining to the above commodity hedges will remain in aoci and are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedge transaction is reported in earnings 
based on estimated volumes  as of december   prism gas had hedged approximately and of its commodity risk by volume for and  respectively 
as of december   commodity derivative assets of million were included in current assets and million were included in non current assets on the balance sheet 
we anticipate entering into additional commodity derivatives on an ongoing basis to manage risk associated with these market fluctuations  and will consider using various commodity derivatives  including forward contracts  swaps  collars  futures and options  although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or that the terms thereof will be similar to our existing hedging arrangements 
in addition  we will enter into derivative arrangements that include the specific ngl products as well as natural gas and crude oil

for additional information regarding our hedging activities  please see note commodity cash flow hedges in our notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our credit facility  which had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  we had a total of million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility as of the date hereof of which million was unhedged floating rate debt 
based on the amount of unhedged floating rate debt owed by us on december   the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in net income of approximately million annually 
we have entered into interest rate protection agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure by fixing a portion of the interest expense we pay on our long term debt under our credit facility 
there is considerable turmoil in the world economy and banking markets which could affect whether the counterparties to such interest rate protection agreements are able to honor their agreements 
if the counterparties fail to honor their commitments  we could experience higher interest rates  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if the counterparties fail to honor their commitments  we also may be required to replace such interest rate protection agreements with new interest rate protection agreements  and such replacement interest rate protection agreements may be at higher rates than our current interest rate protection agreements 

table of contents as of march   we had a total of million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility 
the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of unhedged floating rate debt would result in an increase in interest expense  and a corresponding decrease in net income of approximately million annually
