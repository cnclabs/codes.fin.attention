item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates past judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  accrued liabilities  and contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
short term investments the company invests certain excess cash in marketable securities consisting primarily of commercial paper  auction rate securities  certificates of deposit  and money market funds 
the company classifies all debt securities as available for sale and records the debt securities at fair value with unrealized gains and temporary unrealized losses included in other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity  if material 
declines in fair values that are considered other than temporary are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments effective july   the company implemented statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the company elected to implement this statement with the one year deferral permitted by fasb staff position fsp for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value  except those that are recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis 
this deferral applies to fixed assets and intangible asset impairment testing and initial recognition of asset retirement obligations for which fair value is used 
the company does not expect any significant impact to our consolidated financial statements when we implement sfas for these assets and liabilities 
sfas requires disclosures that categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement 
level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly through market corroborated inputs 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants 
at june   all of the company s financial assets and liabilities are accounted and reported at fair value using level inputs 
also effective july   the company adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
the statement allows entities to value many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas provides guidance over the election of the fair value option  including the timing of the election and specific items eligible for the fair value accounting 
if the fair value option is elected then unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the company elected not to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value as of july  in accordance with sfas accordingly  the adoption of sfas did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
the company did elect to fair value its ars rights that were received in october and exercised in january in accordance with sfas accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the amount that management of the company expects to collect from outstanding balances 
management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are based on management s judgment  considering historical write offs  collections and current credit conditions 
balances which remain outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a credit to the applicable accounts receivable 
payments received subsequent to the time that an account is written off are considered bad debt recoveries 
inventory inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market 
cost of raw materials is determined using the weighted average method 
cost of work in process and finished goods is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
fixed assets fixed assets are capitalized and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
when assets are sold or otherwise disposed of  the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives production equipment to years office equipment to years furniture and fixtures to years leasehold improvements and capital lease assets are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset 
management of the company periodically reviews the net carrying value of all of its equipment on an asset by asset basis 
these reviews consider the net realizable value of each asset to determine whether an impairment in value has occurred  and the need for any asset impairment write down 
although management has made its best estimate of the factors that affect the carrying value based on current conditions  it is reasonably possible that changes could occur which could adversely affect management s estimate of net cash flows expected to be generated from its assets  and necessitate asset impairment write downs 
deferred financing costs financing costs related to the acquisition of debt are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method 
deferred financing costs include the fair value of common shares issued to certain shareholders for their guarantee of certain company debt in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interest on receivables and payables and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 classification of debt issue costs in the statement of cash flows 
the value of the shares issued was the estimated market price of the shares as of the date of issuance 
amortization of deferred financing costs  totaling  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  is included in financing expense on the statements of operations 
licenses amortization of licenses is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets 
in fiscal year  the company entered into an agreement with ibt  sa  a belgian company ibt to use ibt s proprietary ink jet production process and its proprietary polymer seed technology for use in brachytherapy procedures using cesium cs 
the company paid license fees of  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal year  the company determined that the entire remaining value of the ibt license was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of  amortization of licenses was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
based on the licenses recorded at june   and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets  the annual amortization expense for each fiscal year ending june is expected to be as follows  for  for all years thereafter 
other assets other assets  which include deferred charges and patents  are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization 
amortization of patents is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets 
the company periodically reviews the carrying values of patents and any impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows to be derived from such assets are less than their carrying value 
based on the patents and other intangible assets recorded in other assets at june   and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets  the annual amortization expense for each fiscal year ending june is expected to be as follows  for   for   for   for   for  and  thereafter 
asset retirement obligation the fair value of the future retirement costs of the company s leased assets are recorded as a liability on a discounted basis when they are incurred and an equivalent amount is capitalized to property and equipment 
the initial recorded obligation is discounted using the company s credit adjusted risk free rate and is reviewed periodically for changes in the estimated future costs underlying the obligation 
the company amortizes the initial amount capitalized to property and equipment and recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the estimated remaining useful life of the leased assets 
in fiscal year  the company established an initial asset retirement obligation of  which represented the discounted cost of cleanup that the company anticipated it would have to incur at the end of its equipment and property leases in its old production facility 
this amount was determined based on discussions with qualified production personnel and on historical evidence 
during fiscal year  the company reevaluated its obligations based on discussions with the washington department of health and determined that the initial asset retirement obligation should be increased by an additional  during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company removed all radioactive residuals and tenant improvements from its old production facility and returned the facility to the lessor 
the company had an asset retirement obligation of  accrued for this facility but total costs incurred to decommission the facility were  resulting in an additional expense of  that is included in cost of products sold 
the additional expense was mainly due to unanticipated construction costs to return the facility to its previous state 
the company originally believed that the lessor would retain many of the leasehold improvements in the building  but the lessor instead required their removal 
in september  another asset retirement obligation of  was established representing the discounted cost of the company s estimate of the obligations to remove any residual radioactive materials and all leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term at its new production facility 
the estimate was developed by qualified production personnel and the general contractor of the new facility 
the company has reviewed the estimate again based on its experience with decommissioning its old facility and believes that the original estimate continues to be applicable 
during the years ended june  and  the asset retirement obligations changed as follows beginning balance new obligation settlement of existing obligation accretion of discount ending balance because the company does not expect to incur any expenses related to its asset retirement obligations in fiscal year  the entire balance as of june  is classified as a noncurrent liability 
financial instruments the company discloses the fair value of financial instruments  both assets and liabilities  recognized and not recognized in the balance sheet  for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than a forced liquidation sale 
the carrying amounts of financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  notes payable  and capital lease obligations  approximated their fair values at june  and revenue recognition the company applies the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for the disclosure of revenue recognition policies 
the company recognizes revenue related to product sales when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii shipment has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and was derived solely from sales of the proxcelan cs brachytherapy seed  which is used in the treatment of cancer 
the company recognizes revenue once the product has been shipped to the customer 
prepayments  if any  received from customers prior to the time that products are shipped are recorded as deferred revenue 
in these cases  when the related products are shipped  the amount recorded as deferred revenue is then recognized as revenue 
the company accrues for sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment 
although the company does not have an extensive operating history upon which to develop sales returns estimates  we have used the expertise of our management team  particularly those with extensive industry experience and knowledge  to develop a proper methodology 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes expense for all share based payments at fair value 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate fair value for all stock options on the date of grant 
for stock options that vest over time  the company recognizes compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
research and development costs research and development costs  including salaries  research materials  administrative expenses and contractor fees  are charged to operations as incurred 
the cost of equipment used in research and development activities which has alternative uses is capitalized as part of fixed assets and not treated as an expense in the period acquired 
depreciation of capitalized equipment used to perform research and development is classified as research and development expense in the year recognized 
legal contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  patent rights  environmental matters  and a variety of other matters 
the company is also subject to various local  state  and federal environmental regulations and laws due to the isotopes used to produce the company s product 
as part of normal operations  amounts are expended to ensure that the company is in compliance with these laws and regulations 
while there have been no reportable incidents or compliance issues  the company believes that if it relocates its current production facilities then certain decommissioning expenses will be incurred and has recorded an asset retirement obligation for these expenses 
the company records contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against it  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  the company does not believe any probable legal proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims  it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
under this method  the company provides deferred income taxes for temporary differences that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years based on the reporting of certain costs in different periods for financial statement and income tax purposes 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment of the change 
on july   the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in the course of its assessment  management has determined that the company  its subsidiary  and its predecessors are subject to examination of their income tax filings in the united states and state jurisdictions for the through tax years 
in the event that the company is assessed penalties and or interest  penalties will be charged to other operating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense 
the company adopted fin no 
using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of july  there was no impact on the financial statements as of and for the year ended june  as a result of the adoption of fin no

income loss per common share basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding  and does not include the impact of any potentially dilutive common stock equivalents 
common stock equivalents  including warrants and options to purchase the company s common stock  are excluded from the calculations when their effect is antidilutive 
at june  and  the calculation of diluted weighted average shares does not include preferred stock  common stock warrants or options that are potentially convertible into common stock as those would be antidilutive due to the company s net loss position 
securities that could be dilutive in the future as of june  and are as follows preferred stock common stock warrants common stock options total potential dilutive securities subsequent events effective april   the company adopted sfas no 
 subsequent events 
this statement establishes the accounting for  and disclosure of  material events that occur after the balance sheet date  but before the financial statements are issued 
in general  these events will be recognized if the condition existed at the date of the balance sheet  and will not be recognized if the condition did not exist at the balance sheet date 
disclosure is required for nonrecognized events if required to keep the financial statements from being misleading 
the guidance in this statement is very similar to current guidance provided in accounting literature and  therefore  will not result in significant changes in practice 
subsequent events have been evaluated through the date our financial statements were issued the filing time and date of our annual report on form k 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates and affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
results of operations financial presentation the following sets forth a discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations for the two years ended june  and this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors  beginning on page of this annual report on form k 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  product sales 
sales for the year ended june  were  compared to sales of  for the year ended june  the decrease of  or was mainly due to decreased sales volume of the company s proxcelan cs brachytherapy seeds along with an increased percentage of loose seed sales as compared to stranded and a lower average invoice price due to physicians using less seeds 
loose seeds including seeds loaded in mick cartridges sell at a lower price than stranded due to the additional processing time and expense required for stranded seeds 
about of the decrease is due to physicians ordering less seeds per implant as they have become more efficient with use of the isotope and its characteristics 
the company will need to increase the number of total implants to increase sales 
management believes that other treatment options with higher reimbursement rates  such as imrt  put pressure on proxcelan cs seed sales as well as other brachytherapy seed sales 
during the year ended june  the company sold its cs seeds to different medical centers as compared to centers during the fiscal year ended june  cost of product sales 
cost of product sales were  for the year ended june  which represents a decrease of  or compared to cost of product sales of  for the year ended june  materials expense decreased approximately  mainly due to ordering and using less isotope in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  personnel expenses  including payroll  benefits  and related taxes  decreased approximately  due to a reduction in the average production headcount levels 
preload expenses decreased approximately  due to lower sales volumes and due to increased in house loading 
small tools expenses decreased approximately  mainly due to expensing items in the prior year that were part of equipping the new facility that became operational in september share based compensation decreased approximately  mainly due to the forfeiture of unvested options by the company s former evp operations 
these decreases were offset by an impairment of the company s ibt license for  that was recorded in december management completed its review of the license and associated technology related to this alternative seed encapsulation process in december and determined that the adoption of this process would entail an overhaul of the company s existing manufacturing procedures 
in addition  there is no assurance that physicians would accept this new technology without extensive education and marketing 
as there are no anticipated future revenues from the license and the company cannot sell or transfer the license  its entire value was written off in the accompanying financial statements 
during the year ended june   the company removed all radioactive residuals and tenant improvements from its old production facility and returned the facility to the lessor 
the company had an asset retirement obligation of  accrued for this facility but total costs incurred to decommission the facility were  resulting in an additional expense of  that is included in cost of products sold for the year ended june  this additional expense incurred in the year ended june  was mainly due to unanticipated construction costs to return the facility to its previous state

research and development expenses for the year ended june  were  which represents a decrease of  or less than the research and development expenses of  for the year ended june  the major components of the decrease were personnel  consulting  and travel expenses 
personnel expenses  including payroll  benefits  and related taxes  decreased approximately  due to lower headcount 
consulting expenses decreased approximately  as the company s project to improve the efficiency of isotope production is currently progressing slowly and the company has discontinued most funding until the final prototype testing trial 
travel expenses decreased approximately  due to less international travel than occurred in the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in protocol expenses of approximately  mainly due to the company s dual therapy study and its continued monitoring and updating of the mono therapy study 
also in the year ended june   the company finalized its on going strategy regarding foreign patents and trademarks and wrote off  of previously capitalized costs 
the company had pursued prosecution of these patents and trademarks in various foreign countries including australia  japan  and china  however  the company no longer believes that pursuing patents and trademarks in these foreign countries is fundamental to its business strategy 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were  for the year ended june  this represents a decrease of  or compared to the year ended june  when sales and marketing expenses were  personnel expenses  including payroll  benefits  and related taxes  decreased approximately  due to a lower sales headcount and lower commissions due to lower revenues and a revised sales compensation plan that was originally introduced in april and subsequently amended in october travel expenses also decreased approximately  due to the decrease in average headcount

legal expenses decreased by approximately  as in the year ended june  the company incurred legal fees for contract drafting and review of the company s interest in uraldial  the ibt strategic global alliance agreements  settlement agreements with former officers and directors  and for mediation costs 
these decreased legal costs were partially offset by legal fees incurred in settling a lawsuit with a former employee 
travel expenses also decreased approximately  these decreases were partially offset by increased expense related to bad debt allowance of approximately  and increased consulting expenses of approximately  mainly due to compensation paid to the company s interim ceo and the costs of the company s iso and ce mark audit that was conducted in july operating loss 
the company continues to focus its resources on improving sales while retaining the necessary administrative infrastructure to increase the level of demand for the company s product 
these objectives and resulting costs have resulted in operating losses since the company s inception 
for the year ended june   the company had an operating loss of  which is a decrease of  or below the operating loss of  for the year ended june  interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended june  compared to interest income of  for the year ended june  interest and investment income is mainly derived from excess funds held in money market and investment accounts 
the decrease of  or was due to the lower average cash and short term investment balances during the year ended june  and decreased interest rates

liquidity and capital resources 
we have historically financed our operations through the sale of common stock and related warrants 
during fiscal year  the company primarily used existing cash reserves to fund its operations and capital expenditures 
cash flows from operating activities cash used in operating activities was approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of approximately million 
cash used by operating activities is net loss adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash flows from investing activities cash provided by investing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
cash expenditures for fixed assets were approximately  in fiscal year and approximately million in fiscal year due to completing our current production facility 
the company sold its remaining auction rate securities in january which generated million of cash proceeds 
the company reinvested most of these proceeds in money market funds and certificates of deposit with maturities of less than months which are classified as cash equivalents on the balance sheet 
cash flows from financing activities cash used in financing activities was approximately  for the year ended june  and was used mainly for payments of debt and capital leases 
projected liquidity and capital resources at june   cash and cash equivalents amounted to  and short term investments amounted to  compared to  of cash and cash equivalents and  of short term investments at june  the company had approximately million of cash and  of short term investments as of september  as of that date management believed that the company s monthly required cash operating expenditures were approximately  which represents a significant decrease of approximately  to  from average monthly expenses in fiscal year management believes that less than  will be spent on capital expenditures for the entire fiscal year  but there is no assurance that unanticipated needs for capital equipment may not arise 
the company s loan with bfedd matures in fiscal year and will be paid in full by the end of the second quarter 
the balance of the loan at june  was  and is included in current liabilities 
if the company is able to complete its major research and development project to develop a proprietary separation process to manufacture enriched barium  this process should improve isotope production efficiency during fiscal year the company will owe an additional  to the contractor upon completion of a successful demonstration of the enrichment process 
once a successful demonstration of the enrichment process has occurred  the company will have to decide if the smaller test model will produce sufficient quantities of enriched barium or if an additional investment of  to  will be required to build a larger production model 
during fiscal year  the company intends to continue its existing protocol studies and begin new protocol studies on lung cancer treatment using cs currently  the company has budgeted approximately  in fiscal year for protocol expenses relating to lung cancer as well as continued work on the dual therapy and mono therapy prostate protocols 
assuming operating costs expand proportionately with revenue increases  we continue pursuing other applications for seed usage outside the prostate market  protocols are continued supporting the integrity of our product and sales and marketing expenses remain steady  management believes the company will reach breakeven with revenues of approximately million per month 
based on the foregoing assumptions  management believes cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments on hand at june  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations  debt service  and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
management s plans to attain breakeven and generate additional cash flows include increasing revenues from both new and existing customers through our direct sales channels and through our distributors  expanding into other market applications which initially will include head and neck and lung  and maintaining cost control 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will attain profitability or that the company will be able to attain its revenue targets 
if we do not experience the necessary increases in sales or if we experience unforeseen manufacturing constraints  we may need to obtain additional funding 
the company expects to finance its future cash needs through solicitation of warrant holders to exercise their warrants  the sale of equity securities and possibly strategic collaborations or debt financing or through other sources that may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
if the company needs to raise additional money to fund its operations  funding may not be available to it on acceptable terms  or at all 
if the company is unable to raise additional funds when needed  it may not be able to market its products as planned or continue development and regulatory approval of its future products 
if the company raises additional funds through warrant exercises or equity sales  these sales may be dilutive to existing investors

the company is currently in violation of the covenants regarding paying officers in excess of  per year  paying rent in excess of  per year at its current location  and repurchasing any of its outstanding stock 
under the terms of the loan agreement  bfedd can raise the interest rate to percent or request repayment of the entire amount outstanding after giving the company days notice 
if bfedd were to take these measures  the company would immediately repay the remaining balance of the loan 
haeifc has granted the company a waiver from enforcing a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the waiver is effective through june  the company no longer has any capital leases as of june  other commitments and contingencies on may   medical entered into a lease for its new production facility with energy northwest  the owner of the applied process engineering laboratory the apel lease 
the apel lease has a three year term expiring on april   an option to renew for two additional three year terms  and original monthly rent of approximately  subject to annual increases based on the consumer price index  plus monthly janitorial expenses of approximately this new facility became operational in september due to a reduction in some lab and office space at apel  the rent has been reduced to approximately  per month plus monthly janitorial expenses of approximately future minimum lease payments under operating leases  including the two three year renewals of the apel lease  are as follows year ending june  thereafter in february  the company signed a license agreement with international brachytherapy sa ibt  a belgian company  covering north america and providing the company with access to ibt s ink jet production process and its proprietary polymer seed technology for use in brachytherapy procedures using cs under the original agreement royalty payments were to be paid on net sales revenue incorporating the technology 
on october   the company entered into amendment no 
the amendment to its license agreement dated february  with ibt 
the company paid license fees of  under the original agreement and  under the amendment during fiscal years and  respectively 
the amendment eliminates the previously required royalty payments based on net sales revenue  and the parties originally intended to negotiate terms for future payments by the company for polymer seed components to be purchased at ibt s cost plus a to be determined profit percentage 
management no longer believes that introducing cs polymer seeds is a viable strategy due to concerns regarding physician acceptance and the costs to revamp the company s existing manufacturing procedures to incorporate this technology 
in december  the company recorded an impairment charge to write down this license based on its current intentions to not utilize this technology 
in november  a subsidiary of the company entered into a written contract with a contractor based in the ukraine to formalize a research and development project originally begun over three years ago to develop a proprietary separation process to manufacture enriched barium 
there is no assurance that this process can be developed 
the contract called for an initial payment of  and a payment of  upon completion of a successful demonstration 
the company s initial demonstration has been postponed due to an electrical problem that damaged equipment and due to economic difficulties in the ukraine that have protracted the contractor s efforts 
the company anticipates that the device will be tested in the fall of but there is no assurance this testing will occur by then or whether it will be successful 
after a successful demonstration  the company will decide if the prototype model will produce sufficient quantities of enriched barium or if a larger production model will need to be built for an additional  to  the company is subject to various local  state  and federal environmental regulations and laws due to the isotopes used to produce the company s product 
as part of normal operations  amounts are expended to ensure that the company is in compliance with these laws and regulations 
while there have been no reportable incidents or compliance issues  the company believes that if it relocates its current production facilities then certain decommissioning expenses will be incurred 
an asset retirement obligation was established in the first quarter of fiscal year for the company s obligations at its new production facility 
this asset retirement obligation will be for obligations to remove any residual radioactive materials and to remove all leasehold improvements 
the industry that the company operates in is subject to product liability litigation
