we compete in the hosiery market by striving to offer superior values and executing integrated marketing activities  as well as focusing on the style of our hosiery products 
we market hosiery products under our l eggs  hanes and just my size brands 
net sales for the year ended january  from our hosiery segment were million  representing approximately of total segment net sales 
we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry and with shifts in consumer preferences 
other 
our other segment consists of sales of nonfinished products such as yarn and certain other materials in the united states and latin america that maintain asset utilization at certain manufacturing facilities and are expected to generate break even margins 
net sales for the year ended january  in our other segment were million  representing less than of total segment net sales 
net sales from our other segment are expected to continue to decline and to ultimately become insignificant to us as we complete the implementation of our consolidation and globalization efforts 

table of contents business and industry trends we are operating in an uncertain and volatile economic environment  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business 
the current retail environment has been impacted by recent volatility in the financial markets  including declines in stock prices  and by uncertain economic conditions 
increases in food and fuel prices  changes in the credit and housing markets leading to the current financial and credit crisis  actual and potential job losses among many sectors of the economy  significant declines in the stock market resulting in large losses to consumer retirement and investment accounts  and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and economic policies have all added to declines in consumer confidence and curtailed retail spending 
we expect the weak retail environment to continue and do not expect macroeconomic conditions to be conducive to growth in achieving financial results that compare favorably with year ago results will be challenging in the first half of in the first quarter of  we expect a sales decline that is more or less consistent with the fourth quarter trend and reflects expected lower casualwear sales in the outerwear segment primarily in the first half of we also expect substantial pressure on profitability due to the economic climate  significantly higher commodity costs  increased pension costs and increased costs associated with implementing our price increase that is not effective for the entire first quarter of  including repackaging costs 
the apparel essentials market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly 
competition is generally based upon price  brand name recognition  product quality  selection  service and purchasing convenience 
the majority of our core styles continue from year to year  with variations only in color  fabric or design details 
some products  however  such as intimate apparel  activewear and sheer hosiery  do have an emphasis on style and innovation 
our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers  as well as smaller companies  department stores  specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell apparel essentials products under private labels that compete directly with our brands 
our top ten customers accounted for of our net sales and our top customer  wal mart  accounted for over billion of our sales for the year ended january  our largest customers in the year ended january  were wal mart  target and kohl s  which accounted for  and of total sales  respectively 
the growth in retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek to have greater concessions in their purchase of our products  while they can be increasingly demanding that we provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis 
to counteract these effects  it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in today s challenging economic environment 
in addition  during the past several years  various retailers  including some of our largest customers  have experienced significant difficulties  including restructurings  bankruptcies and liquidations  and the ability of retailers to overcome these difficulties may increase due to the recent deterioration of worldwide economic conditions 
anticipating changes in and managing our operations in response to consumer preferences remains an important element of our business 
in recent years  we have experienced changes in our net sales  revenues and cash flows in accordance with changes in consumer preferences and trends 
for example  we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry and with shifts in consumer preferences 
the hosiery segment only comprised of our net sales in the year ended january  however  and as a result  the decline in the hosiery segment has not had a significant impact on our net sales  revenues or cash flows 
generally  we manage the hosiery segment for cash  placing an emphasis on reducing our cost structure and managing cash efficiently 
our key business strategies sell more  spend less and generate cash are our broad strategies to build our brands  reduce our costs and generate cash 
sell more through our sell more strategy  we seek to drive profitable growth by consistently offering consumers brands they love and trust and products with unsurpassed value 
key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include 
table of contents build big  strong brands in big core categories with innovative key items 
our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success 
our design  research and product development teams  in partnership with our marketing teams  drive our efforts to bring innovations to market 
we seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the apparel essentials industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing  addressing changing customer needs and industry trends 
we also support our key brands with targeted  effective advertising and marketing campaigns 
foster strategic partnerships with key retailers via team selling 
we foster relationships with key retailers by applying our extensive category and product knowledge  leveraging our use of multi functional customer management teams and developing new customer specific programs such as c by champion for target 
our goal is to strengthen and deepen our existing strategic relationships with retailers and develop new strategic relationships 
use kanban concepts to have the right products available in the right quantities at the right time 
through kanban  a multi initiative effort that determines production quantities  and in doing so  facilitates just in time production and ordering systems  we seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively managing inventory levels 
spend less through our spend less strategy  we seek to become an integrated organization that leverages its size and global reach to reduce costs  improve flexibility and provide a high level of service 
key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include globalizing our supply chain by balancing across hemispheres into economic clusters with fewer  larger facilities 
as a provider of high volume products  we are continually seeking to improve our cost competitiveness and operating flexibility through supply chain initiatives 
through our consolidation and globalization strategy  which is discussed in more detail below  we will continue to transition additional parts of our supply chain to lower cost locations in asia  central america and the caribbean basin in an effort to optimize our cost structure 
as part of this process  we are using kanban concepts to optimize the way we manage demand  to increase manufacturing flexibility to better respond to demand variability and to simplify our finished goods and the raw materials we use to produce them 
we expect that these changes in our supply chain will result in significant cost efficiencies and increased asset utilization 
leverage our global purchasing and manufacturing scale 
historically  we have had a decentralized operating structure with many distinct operating units 
we are in the process of consolidating purchasing  manufacturing and sourcing across all of our product categories in the united states 
we believe that these initiatives will streamline our operations  improve our inventory management  reduce costs and standardize processes 
generate cash through our generate cash strategy  we seek to effectively generate and invest cash at or above our weighted average cost of capital to provide superior returns for both our equity and debt investors 
key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include optimizing our capital structure to take advantage of our business model s strong and consistent cash flows 
maintaining appropriate debt leverage and utilizing excess cash to  for example  pay down debt  invest in our own stock and selectively pursue strategic acquisitions are keys to building a stronger business and generating additional value for investors 
continuing to improve turns for accounts receivables  inventory  accounts payable and fixed assets 
our ability to generate cash is enhanced through more efficient management of accounts receivables  inventory  accounts payable and fixed assets 

table of contents consolidation and globalization strategy we expect to continue our restructuring efforts as we continue to execute our consolidation and globalization strategy 
we have closed plant locations  reduced our workforce  and relocated some of our manufacturing capacity to lower cost locations in asia  central america and the caribbean basin 
for example  during the year ended january   in furtherance of our consolidation and globalization strategy  we approved actions to close manufacturing facilities and three distribution centers and eliminate approximately  positions in mexico  the united states  costa rica  honduras and el salvador 
in addition  approximately management and administrative positions were eliminated  with the majority of these positions based in the united states 
we also have recognized accelerated depreciation with respect to owned or leased assets associated with manufacturing facilities and distribution centers which closed during or we anticipate closing in the next several years as part of our consolidation and globalization strategy 
while we believe that this strategy has had and will continue to have a beneficial impact on our operational efficiency and cost structure  we have incurred significant costs to implement these initiatives 
in particular  we have recorded charges for severance and other employment related obligations relating to workforce reductions  as well as payments in connection with lease and other contract terminations 
in addition  we incurred charges for one time write offs of stranded raw materials and work in process inventory determined not to be salvageable or cost effective to relocate related to the closure of manufacturing facilities 
these amounts are included in the cost of sales  restructuring and selling  general and administrative expenses lines of our statements of income 
our significant supply chain capital spending and acquisition actions during include during the second quarter of  we added three company owned sewing plants in southeast asia two in vietnam and one in thailand giving us four sewing plants in asia 
in october  we acquired a employee embroidery facility in honduras 
for the past eight years  these operations have produced embroidered and screen printed apparel for us 
this acquisition better positions us for long term growth in these segments 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced production at our  square foot socks manufacturing facility in el salvador 
this facility  co located with textile manufacturing operations that we acquired in  provides a manufacturing base in central america from which to leverage our production scale at a lower cost location 
we continued construction of a textile production plant in nanjing  china  which will be our first company owned textile production facility in asia 
we expect production to commence in the fourth quarter of the nanjing textile facility will enable us to expand and leverage our production scale in asia as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres 
we have made significant progress in our multiyear goal of generating gross savings that could approach or exceed million 
as a result of the restructuring actions taken since our spin off from sara lee on september   our cost structure was reduced and efficiencies improved  generating savings of million during the year ended january  in addition to the saving generated from restructuring actions  we benefited from million in savings related to other cost reduction initiatives during the year ended january  of the seven manufacturing facilities and distribution centers approved for closure in  two were closed in and five were closed in of the manufacturing facilities and distribution centers approved for closure in  were closed in and nine were closed in of the manufacturing facilities and distribution centers approved for closure in  nine were closed in and five are expected to close in for more information about our restructuring actions  see note  titled restructuring to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the continued implementation of our globalization and consolidation strategy  which is designed to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs  has resulted and is likely to continue to result in significant costs in the short term and generate savings as well as higher inventory levels for the next to months 
as further plans are developed and approved  we expect to recognize additional restructuring costs as we eliminate duplicative functions within the organization and transition a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to lower cost locations 
as a result of this strategy  we expect to incur approximately million in restructuring and related charges over the three year period following the spin off from sara lee on september   of which approximately half is 
table of contents expected to be noncash 
as of january   we have recognized approximately million and announced approximately million in restructuring and related charges related to these efforts since september  of these charges  approximately million relates to accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment for facilities that have been or will be closed  approximately million relates to employee termination and other benefits  approximately million relates to write offs of stranded raw materials and work in process inventory determined not to be salvageable or cost effective to relocate  approximately million relates to lease termination and other costs and approximately million related to impairments of fixed assets 
seasonality and other factors our operating results are subject to some variability 
generally  our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items 
sales are typically higher in the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year 
socks  hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during this period as a result of cooler weather  back to school shopping and holidays 
sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand 
our customers may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us 
for example  we experienced a shift in timing by our largest retail customers of back to school programs from june to july in our results of operations are also impacted by fluctuations and volatility in the price of cotton and oil related materials and the timing of actual spending for our media  advertising and promotion expenses 
media  advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions 
although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned  rather than on an impulse  basis  our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by our customers 
discretionary spending is affected by many factors  including  among others  general business conditions  interest rates  inflation  consumer debt levels  the availability of consumer credit  currency exchange rates  taxation  electricity power rates  gasoline prices  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
many of these factors are outside of our control 
our customers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  could decline during periods when disposable income is lower  when prices increase in response to rising costs  or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
these consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or lower priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products  or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our domestic price increases that become effective from time to time 
inflation and changing prices inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins 
for example  a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and a further decline in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs 
similarly  the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process  such as oil related commodity prices  rose during the summer of as a result of inflation and other factors 
in addition  inflation often is accompanied by higher interest rates  which could have a negative impact on spending  in which case our margins could decrease 
moreover  increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in income  which also could have a negative impact on spending 
if we incur increased costs that are unable to be recouped  or if consumer spending continues to decrease generally  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected 
in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs on our operating results  we informed our retail customers during that we would be raising domestic prices effective during the first quarter of we are implementing an average gross price increase of four percent in our domestic product categories 
the range of price increases varies by individual product category 
our costs for cotton yarn and cotton based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton  which is affected by weather  consumer demand  speculation on the commodities market  the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control 
while we do enter into short term supply agreements and hedges from time to time in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices  although cotton represents only of our cost of sales 
cotton prices were cents per pound for the year ended january  and cents per pound for the year ended december  the price of cotton currently in our inventory is in the mid cents per pound range which is 
table of contents the price that will impact our operating results in the first half of the prices for the most recent cotton crop  which will impact our operating results in the second half of  have decreased to the low cents per pound range 
in addition  during the summer of we experienced a spike in oil related commodity prices and other raw materials used in our products  such as dyes and chemicals  and increases in other costs  such as fuel  energy and utility costs 
further discussion of the market sensitivity of cotton is included in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
components of net sales and expense net sales we generate net sales by selling apparel essentials such as t shirts  bras  panties  men s underwear  kids underwear  socks  hosiery  casualwear and activewear 
our net sales are recognized net of discounts  coupons  rebates  volume based incentives and cooperative advertising costs 
we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the sales price is fixed or determinable  iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  which occurs primarily upon shipment 
net sales include an estimate for returns and allowances based upon historical return experience 
we also offer a variety of sales incentives to resellers and consumers that are recorded as reductions to net sales 
cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing finished goods  which consists of labor  raw materials such as cotton and petroleum based products and overhead costs such as depreciation on owned facilities and equipment 
our cost of sales also includes finished goods sourced from third party manufacturers that supply us with products based on our designs as well as charges for slow moving or obsolete inventories 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
our costs of sales do not include shipping costs  comprised of payments to third party shippers  or handling costs  comprised of warehousing costs in our distribution facilities  and thus our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities that include such costs in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include selling  advertising  costs of shipping  handling and distribution to our customers  research and development  rent on leased facilities  depreciation on owned facilities and equipment and other general and administrative expenses 
also included for periods presented prior to the spin off on september  are allocations of corporate expenses that consist of expenses for business insurance  medical insurance  employee benefit plan amounts and  because we were part of sara lee those periods  allocations from sara lee for certain centralized administration costs for treasury  real estate  accounting  auditing  tax  risk management  human resources and benefits administration 
these allocations of centralized administration costs were determined on bases that we and sara lee considered to be reasonable and take into consideration and include relevant operating profit  fixed assets  sales and payroll 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include management payroll  benefits  travel  information systems  accounting  insurance and legal expenses 
restructuring we have from time to time closed facilities and reduced headcount  including in connection with previously announced restructuring and business transformation plans 
we refer to these activities as restructuring actions 
when we decide to close facilities or reduce headcount  we take estimated charges for such restructuring  including charges for exited non cancelable leases and other contractual obligations  as well as severance and benefits 
if the actual charge is different from the original estimate  an adjustment is recognized in the period such change in estimate is identified 

table of contents other income expenses our other income expenses include charges such as losses on early extinguishment of debt and certain other non operating items 
interest expense  net as part of the spin off from sara lee on september   we incurred billion of debt 
since the spin off  we have made changes in our financing structuring and have made net principal payments of million of debt 
in december  we issued million of floating rate senior notes and the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the debt incurred at the spin off 
in november  we entered into the receivables facility which provides for up to million in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing  all of which we borrowed and used to repay a portion of the senior secured credit facility 
in addition  we have amended the terms of our senior secured credit facility and second lien credit facility to provide more flexibility to change our financial structure in the future 
our interest expense is net of interest income 
interest income is the return we earned on our cash and cash equivalents and  historically  on money we loaned to sara lee as part of its corporate cash management practices 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 
income tax expense benefit our effective income tax rate fluctuates from period to period and can be materially impacted by  among other things changes in the mix of our earnings from the various jurisdictions in which we operate  the tax characteristics of our earnings  the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we repatriate to the united states  which may increase our tax expense and taxes paid  and the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing positions in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
highlights from the year ended january  diluted earnings per share were in the year ended january   compared with in the year ended december  operating profit was million in the year ended january   compared with million in the year ended december  total net sales in the year ended january  was billion  compared with billion to the year ended december  during the year ended january   we approved actions to close manufacturing facilities and three distribution centers in mexico  the united states  costa rica  honduras and el salvador 
the production capacity represented by the manufacturing facilities has been relocated to lower cost locations in asia  central america and the caribbean basin 
the distribution capacity has been relocated to our west coast distribution facility in california in order to expand capacity for goods we source from asia 
in addition  we completed several such actions in the year ended january  that were approved in gross capital expenditures were million during the year ended january  as we continued to build out our textile and sewing network in asia  central america and the caribbean basin 
during the second quarter of  we added three company owned sewing plants in southeast asia two in vietnam and one in thailand giving us four sewing plants in asia 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we acquired an embroidery facility in honduras 

table of contents we repurchased million of company stock during the year ended january  we ended with million of borrowing availability under our million revolving loan facility the revolving loan facility  million in cash and cash equivalents and million of borrowing availability under our international loan facilities  compared to million  million and million  respectively  at the end of consolidated results of operations year ended january  compared with year ended december  years ended january  december  higher percent lower change dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses gain on curtailment of postretirement benefits   nm restructuring operating profit other income expense interest expense  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income net sales years ended january  december  higher percent lower change dollars in thousands net sales consolidated net sales were lower by million or in compared to primarily due to weak sales at retail  which reflect a difficult economic and retail environment in which the ultimate consumers of our products have been significantly limiting their discretionary spending and visiting retail stores less frequently 
the economic recession continued to impact consumer spending  resulting in one of the worst holiday shopping seasons in years as retail sales fell for the sixth straight month in december 
our innerwear  outerwear  hosiery and other segment net sales were lower by million  million  million and million  respectively  and were partially offset by higher net sales in our international segment of million 
although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned  rather than on an impulse  basis  weakness in the retail environment can impact our results in the short term  as it did in the total impact of the rd week in  which is included in the amounts above  was a million increase in sales 
the lower net sales in our innerwear segment were primarily due to a decline in the intimate apparel  socks  thermals and sleepwear product categories 
total intimate apparel net sales were million lower in compared to we experienced lower intimate apparel sales in our smaller brands barely there  just my size and wonderbra of million  our hanes brand of million and our private label brands of million which we believe was primarily attributable to weaker sales at retail as noted above 
in compared to  our playtex brand intimate apparel net sales were higher by million and our bali brand intimate apparel net sales were lower by million 
net sales in our male underwear product category were million lower  which includes 
table of contents the impact of exiting a license arrangement for a boys character underwear program in early that lowered sales by million 
in addition  net sales of socks  thermals and sleepwear product categories were lower in compared to by million  million and million  respectively 
in our outerwear segment  net sales of our champion brand activewear were million higher in compared to  and were offset by lower net sales of our casualwear product categories of million 
net sales in our hosiery segment declined substantially more than the long term trend primarily due to lower sales of the hanes brand to national chains and department stores and our l eggs brand to mass retailers and food and drug stores in compared to we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry and with shifts in consumer preferences 
the overall lower net sales were partially offset by higher net sales in our international segment that were driven by a favorable impact of million related to foreign currency exchange rates and by the growth in our casualwear businesses in europe and asia 
the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to the strengthening of the japanese yen  euro and brazilian real 
the decline in net sales for our other segment is primarily due to the continued vertical integration of a yarn and fabric operation acquisition from with less focus on sales of nonfinished fabric and yarn to third parties 
we expect this decline to continue and sales for this segment to ultimately become insignificant to us as we complete the implementation of our consolidation and globalization efforts 
gross profit years ended january  december  higher percent lower change dollars in thousands gross profit as a percent of net sales  our gross profit percentage was in compared to in while the gross profit percentage was higher  gross profit dollars were lower due to lower sales volume of million  unfavorable product sales mix of million  higher cotton costs of million  higher production costs of million related to higher energy and oil related costs including freight costs and other vendor price increases of million 
the cotton prices reflected in our results were cents per pound in as compared to cents per pound in energy and oil related costs were higher due to a spike in oil related commodity prices during the summer of our results will continue to reflect higher costs for cotton and oil related materials until these costs cease to be reflected on our balance sheet in the first half of and we will start to benefit in the second half of from lower commodity costs 
in addition  in connection with the consolidation and globalization of our supply chain  we incurred one time restructuring related write offs of stranded raw materials and work in process inventory determined not to be salvageable or cost effective to relocate of million in  which were offset by lower accelerated depreciation of million 
these higher expenses were primarily offset by savings from our cost reduction initiatives and prior restructuring actions of million  lower other manufacturing overhead costs of million primarily related to better volumes earlier in the year  lower on going excess and obsolete inventory costs of million  lower sales incentives of million  million of lower duty costs primarily related to higher refunds of million  a million favorable impact related to foreign currency exchange rates  million of favorable one time out of period cost recognition related to the capitalization of certain inventory supplies to be on a consistent basis across all business lines  million of lower start up and shut down costs associated with our consolidation and globalization of our supply chain and higher product sales pricing of million 
our duty refunds were higher in primarily due to the final passage of the dominican republic central america united states free trade agreement in costa rica as a result of which we can  on a one time basis  recover duties paid since january  totaling approximately million 
the lower excess and obsolete inventory costs in are attributable to both our continuous evaluation of inventory levels and simplification of our product category offerings since the spin off 
we realized the benefits of driving down obsolete inventory levels through aggressive management and promotions and realized the benefits from decreases in style counts ranging from to in our various product category offerings 
the quality of our inventory remained good with obsolete inventory down from last year 
the favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact in our international segment was primarily due to the strengthening of the japanese yen  euro and brazilian real 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses years ended january  december  higher percent lower change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses were million lower in compared to our cost reduction efforts resulted in lower expenses in compared to related to savings of million from our prior restructuring actions for compensation and related benefits  lower consulting expenses related to various areas of million  lower non media related media  advertising and promotion expenses map expenses of million  lower accelerated depreciation of million  lower postretirement healthcare and life insurance expense of million and lower stock compensation expense of million 
our media related map expenses were million lower in as compared to while our spending for media related map was down in  it was the second highest spending level in our history

liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our cash generated by operations and availability under our revolving loan facility and our international loan facilities 
at january  we had million of borrowing availability under our million revolving loan facility after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  million in cash and cash equivalents and million of borrowing availability under our international loan facilities 
we currently believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated by operations  together with our available credit capacity  will enable us to comply with the terms of our indebtedness and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements 
the following has or is expected to impact liquidity we have principal and interest obligations under our long term debt  we expect to continue to invest in efforts to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs  we expect to continue to add new manufacturing capacity in asia  central america and the caribbean basin  we anticipate that we will decrease the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states  which could significantly decrease our effective income tax rate  and we have the authority to repurchase up to million shares of our stock in the open market over the next few years  million of which we have repurchased as of january  at a cost of million 
in light of the current economic recession  we may choose not to repurchase any stock and focus more on the repayment of our debt in the next twelve months 
we are operating in an uncertain and volatile economic environment  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business 
the current retail environment has been impacted by recent volatility in the financial markets  including declines in stock prices  and by uncertain economic conditions 
increases in food and fuel prices  changes in the credit and housing markets leading to the current financial and credit crisis  actual and potential job losses among many sectors of the economy  significant declines in the stock market resulting in large losses to consumer retirement and investment accounts  and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and economic policies have all added to declines in consumer confidence and curtailed retail spending 

table of contents we expect the weak retail environment to continue and do not expect macroeconomic conditions to be conducive to growth in achieving financial results that compare favorably with year ago results will be challenging in the first half of in the first quarter of  we expect a sales decline that is more or less consistent with the fourth quarter trend and reflects expected lower casualwear sales in the outerwear segment primarily in the first half of we also expect substantial pressure on profitability due to the economic climate  significantly higher commodity costs  increased pension costs and increased costs associated with implementing our price increase that is not effective for the entire first quarter of  including repackaging costs 
we expect to be able to manage our working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
factors that could help us in these efforts include the domestic gross price increase of commencing during the first quarter of  lower commodity costs in the second half of the year  the ability to execute previously discussed discretionary spending cuts and additional cost benefits from previous restructuring and related actions 
depending on conditions in the capital markets and other factors  we will from time to time consider other financing transactions  the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other purposes 
we continue to monitor the impact  if any  of the current conditions in the credit markets on our operations 
our access to financing at reasonable interest rates could become influenced by the economic and credit market environment 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities 
we ended the year with a leverage ratio  as calculated under the senior secured credit facility  the second lien credit facility and the receivables facility  of to the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the senior secured credit facility and the receivables facility  which are the most restrictive  was to for the quarter ended january  and will decline over time until it reaches to for quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of particularly in the current adverse economic climate  we continue to monitor our covenant compliance carefully 
we expect to maintain compliance with our covenants during  however economic conditions or the occurrence of events discussed above under risk factors could cause noncompliance 
we have been exploring and will continue to explore the multiple options available  including amendments to credit facilities  to ensure that we remain in compliance with our covenants in this uncertain economic environment 
any one of these options could result in significantly higher interest expense in and beyond 
in addition  these options could require modification of our interest rate derivative portfolio  which could require us to make a cash payment in the event of terminating a derivative instrument or impact the effectiveness of our interest rate hedging instruments and require us to take non cash charges 
cash requirements for our business we rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our revolving loan facility and international loan facilities to meet the cash requirements of our business 
the primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the normal course of business  restructuring costs  capital expenditures  maturities of long term debt and related interest payments  contributions to our pension plans and repurchases of our stock 
we believe we have sufficient cash and available borrowings for our short term needs 
in light of the current economic environment and our outlook for  we expect to use excess cash flows to pay down long term debt rather than to repurchase our stock or make discretionary contributions to our pension plans 
the implementation of our consolidation and globalization strategy  which is designed to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs  has resulted and is likely to continue to result in significant costs in the short term and generate savings as well as higher inventory levels for the next to months 
as further plans are developed and approved  we expect to recognize additional restructuring costs as we eliminate duplicative functions within the organization and transition a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to lower cost locations 
while capital spending could vary significantly from year to year  we anticipated early in that our capital spending over the next three years could be as high as million as we continue to execute our supply chain consolidation and globalization strategy and complete the integration and consolidation of our technology systems 
in light of the current economic recession  we have re evaluated our future spending plans and reduced the expected amounts during through to be approximately million 
we will place emphasis in the near term on careful management of our capital expenditures in and capital spending in any given year over the next three years could be significantly in excess of our annual depreciation and amortization expense until the completion of actions related to our globalization strategy at which time we would expect our annual capital spending to be relatively comparable to our annual depreciation and amortization expense

financing arrangements we believe our financing structure provides a secure base to support our ongoing operations and key business strategies 
depending on conditions in the capital markets and other factors  we will from time to time consider other financing transactions  the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other purposes 
we continue to monitor the impact  if any  of the current conditions in the credit markets on our operations 
our access to financing at reasonable interest rates could become influenced by the economic and credit market environment 
deterioration in the capital markets  which has caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  merge with larger and stronger financial institutions and  in some cases  fail  has led to concerns about the stability of financial institutions 
we currently hold interest rate cap and swap derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk and hold foreign exchange rate derivative instruments to mitigate the potential impact of currency fluctuations 
credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to these arrangements 
we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties 
we believe that our exposures are appropriately diversified across counterparties and that these counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions

floating rate senior notes on december   we issued million aggregate principal amount of the floating rate senior notes 
the floating rate senior notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness 
the floating rate senior notes bear interest at an annual rate  reset semi annually  equal to libor plus 
interest is payable on the floating rate senior notes on june and december of each year

the receivables facility will terminate on november  under the terms of the receivables facility  the company sells  on a revolving basis  certain domestic trade receivables to hbi receivables llc receivables llc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary that in turn uses the trade receivables to secure the borrowings  which are funded through conduits that issue commercial paper in the short term market and are not affiliated with us or through committed bank purchasers if the conduits fail to fund 
the assets and liabilities of receivables llc are fully reflected on our consolidated balance sheet  and the securitization is treated as a secured borrowing for accounting purposes 
the borrowings under the receivables facility remain outstanding throughout the term of the agreement subject to our maintaining sufficient eligible receivables by continuing to sell trade receivables to receivables llc unless an event of default occurs 
availability of funding under the facility depends primarily upon the eligible outstanding receivables balance 
as of january   we had million outstanding under the receivables facility 
the outstanding balance under the receivables facility is reported on our consolidated balance sheet in long term debt based on the three year term of the agreement and the fact that remittances on the receivables do not automatically reduce the outstanding borrowings 
we used all million of the proceeds from the receivables facility to make a prepayment of principal under the senior secured credit facility

given the recent turmoil in the financial and credit markets  we have expanded our interest rate hedging portfolio at what we believe to be advantageous rates that are expected to minimize our overall interest rate risk 
at january   we have outstanding hedging arrangements whereby we capped the interest rate on million of our floating rate debt at 
we also entered into interest rate swaps tied to the month and month libor rates whereby we fixed the interest rate on an aggregate of billion of our floating rate debt at a blended rate of approximately

we generally purchase our raw materials at market prices

we generally do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge other raw material commodity prices 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  titled summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
the application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation 
if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements  or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors  are the following sales recognition and incentives we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the sales price is fixed or determinable  iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  which occurs primarily upon shipment 
we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
note d  titled summary of significant accounting policies sales recognition and incentives  to our consolidated financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products 
measuring the cost of these incentives requires  in many cases  estimating future customer utilization 
table of contents and redemption rates 
we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information 
we classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated statements of income in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accounts receivable valuation accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers 
we carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience  specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information 
charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the selling  general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the net sales line of our consolidated statements of income 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a large reserve might be required 
the amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts 
catalog expenses we incur expenses for printing catalogs for our products to aid in our sales efforts 
we initially record these expenses as a prepaid item and charge it against selling  general and administrative expenses over time as the catalog is used 
expenses are recognized at a rate that approximates our historical experience with regard to the timing and amount of sales attributable to a catalog distribution 
inventory valuation we carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out  or fifo  method for our inventories 
we carry obsolete  damaged  and excess inventory at the net realizable value  which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates  current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans 
because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time  there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination 
market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change  resulting in further reserve requirements 
a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period 
while we believe that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item  and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recorded deferred taxes related to operating losses and capital loss carryforwards 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions  the amount and timing of which are uncertain  possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies 
if in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods  we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized 
an adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount 
prior to spin off on september   all income taxes were computed and reported on a separate return basis as if we were not part of sara lee 

table of contents federal income taxes are provided on that portion of our income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states and be taxable  reflecting the historical decisions made by sara lee with regards to earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
in periods after the spin off  we may make different decisions as to the amount of earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions  due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements  which may impact our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate 
we periodically estimate the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and our informed judgment 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to  or further interpretations of  regulations 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur  and these adjustments are included in our consolidated statements of income 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our effective tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which became effective during the year ended december  fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  a company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
in conjunction with the spin off  we and sara lee entered into a tax sharing agreement  which allocates responsibilities between us and sara lee for taxes and certain other tax matters 
under the tax sharing agreement  sara lee generally is liable for all us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods ending on or before september  sara lee also is liable for income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods beginning before september  and ending after september   but only to the extent those taxes are allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on september  we are generally liable for all other taxes attributable to us 
changes in the amounts payable or receivable by us under the stipulations of this agreement may impact our tax provision in any period 
under the tax sharing agreement  within days after sara lee filed its final consolidated tax return for the period that included september   sara lee was required to deliver to us a computation of the amount of deferred taxes attributable to our united states and canadian operations that would be included on our opening balance sheet as of september  as finally determined which has been done 
we have the right to participate in the computation of the amount of deferred taxes 
under the tax sharing agreement  if substituting the amount of deferred taxes as finally determined for the amount of estimated deferred taxes that were included on that balance sheet at the time of the spin off causes a decrease in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet  then sara lee will be required to pay us the amount of such decrease 
if such substitution causes an increase in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet  then we will be required to pay sara lee the amount of such increase 
for purposes of this computation  our deferred taxes are the amount of deferred tax benefits including deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards that would be recognized as assets on the company s balance sheet computed in accordance with gaap  but without regard to valuation allowances  less the amount of deferred tax liabilities including deferred tax consequences attributable to taxable temporary differences that would be recognized as liabilities on our opening balance sheet computed in accordance with gaap  but without regard to valuation allowances 
neither we nor sara lee will be required to make any other payments to the other with respect to deferred taxes 
our computation of the final amount of deferred taxes for our opening balance sheet as of september  is as follows in thousands estimated deferred taxes subject to the tax sharing agreement included in opening balance sheet on september  final calculation of deferred taxes subject to the tax sharing agreement decrease in deferred taxes as of opening balance sheet on september  preliminary cash installment received from sara lee amount due from sara lee 
table of contents the amount that is expected to be collected from sara lee based on our computation of million is included as a receivable in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of january  stock compensation we established the hanesbrands inc omnibus incentive plan of  the omnibus incentive plan to award stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  deferred stock units  performance shares and cash to our employees  non employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no r  share based payment 
under sfas r  stock based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
estimation of stock based compensation for stock options granted  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility and expected option life 
we use a combination of the volatility of our company and the volatility of peer companies for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions 
we have utilized the simplified method outlined in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
to estimate expected lives of options granted during the period 
sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which was issued in december  amends sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and gives a limited extension on using the simplified method for valuing stock option grants to eligible public companies that do not have sufficient historical exercise patterns on options granted to employees 
further  as required under sfas no 
r  we estimate forfeitures for stock based awards granted  which are not expected to vest 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
defined benefit pension plans for a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost  plan obligations  plan assets  and how we measure the amount of these costs  see note titled defined benefit pension plans to our consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with the spin off from sara lee which occurred on september   we established the hanesbrands inc pension and retirement plan  which assumed the portion of the underfunded liabilities and the portion of the assets of pension plans sponsored by sara lee that relate to our employees 
in addition  we assumed sponsorship of certain other sara lee plans and continued sponsorship of the playtex apparel inc pension plan and the national textiles  llc pension plan 
as of january   the benefits under these plans were frozen 
since the spin off  we have voluntarily contributed million to our pension plans 
additionally  during we completed the separation of our pension plan assets and liabilities from those of sara lee in accordance with governmental regulations  which resulted in a higher total amount of pension plan assets of approximately million being transferred to us than originally was estimated prior to the spin off 
as a result  our us qualified pension plans are approximately funded as of january  we may elect to make voluntary contributions to obtain an funded level which will avoid certain benefit payment restrictions under the pension protection act 
the funded status as of january  reflects a significant decrease in the fair value of plan assets due to the stock market s performance during in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb no 
  and r sfas 
sfas requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on a company s balance sheet  and changes in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive income  effective fiscal years ending after december   which we adopted as of and for the six months ended december  the impact of adopting the funded status provisions of sfas was an increase in assets of million  an increase in liabilities of million and a pretax increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of million 
sfas also requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of its fiscal year end  effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the measurement date provision during the year ended december   which had an immaterial impact on beginning retained earnings  accumulated other comprehensive income and pension liabilities 
the net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long term rate of asset return 
the net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred 
gains and losses  which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions  are amortized over the average future expected life of participants 

table of contents our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows in determining the discount rate  we utilized the citigroup pension discount curve rounded to the nearest basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan 
salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
the salary increase assumption applies to the canadian plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans  as benefits under these plans are not frozen 
in determining the long term rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical long term compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments  and the utilization of forward looking assumptions 
retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality 
trademarks and other identifiable intangibles trademarks and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives  and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives 
we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors  including the effects of demand  competition  expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows 
as of january   the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was million  of which we are amortizing the entire balance 
we anticipate that our amortization expense for will be million 
we evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount 
we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
we measure a trademark s fair value using the royalty saved method 
we determine the royalty saved method by evaluating various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
the rates we use to discount cash flows are based on interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time 
because there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them  the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
goodwill as of january   we had million of goodwill 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
we have determined that our reporting units are at the operating segment level 
we rely on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles  there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors  and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step process based on an evaluation of reporting units 
the first step involves a comparison of a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
in the second step  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we compare the goodwill s implied fair value and its carrying 
table of contents value 
if the goodwill s carrying value exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to such excess 
depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at its historical cost  and we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the asset s life 
we estimate an asset s life based on historical experience  manufacturers estimates  engineering or appraisal evaluations  our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us  which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life 
our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization 
a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods 
based upon current levels of depreciation  the average remaining depreciable life of our net property other than land is five years 
we test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
we evaluate an asset s recoverability by comparing the asset or asset group s net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate 
if we determine that an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
when we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use  we depreciate the asset s adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life 
we do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances change 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for property  workers compensation and other casualty programs 
we are responsible for losses up to certain limits and are required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits 
this liability is based on management s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical trends  actuarial assumptions and economic conditions 
if actual trends differ from the estimates  the financial results could be impacted 
actual trends have not differed materially from the estimates 
assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method  which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
we recognize the excess of an acquired business s cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill as discussed below under goodwill 
we use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we generally use third party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles  consulting actuaries to determine the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans  and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claims 
recently issued accounting pronouncements fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas was effective for our financial assets and liabilities on december  the fasb approved a one year deferral of the adoption of sfas as it relates to non financial assets and liabilities with the issuance in february of fasb staff position fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 as a result of which implementation by us is now required on january  the 
table of contents partial adoption of sfas in the first quarter ended march  had no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  but resulted in certain additional disclosures reflected in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas as it relates to our non financial assets and liabilities 
sfas clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
sfas establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of three valuation techniques noted in sfas the three valuation techniques are as follows market approach prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
cost approach amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost 
income approach techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on market expectations  including present value techniques  option pricing and other models 
we primarily apply the market approach for commodity derivatives and the income approach for interest rate and foreign currency derivatives for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
as of january   we held certain financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
these consisted of our derivative instruments related to interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the fair values of cotton derivatives are determined based on quoted prices in public markets and are categorized as level  however  we did not have any outstanding cotton derivatives outstanding at january  the fair values of interest rate and foreign exchange rate derivatives are determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets and are categorized as level we do not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as level  and there were no transfers in or out of level during the year ended january  there were no changes during the year ended january  to our valuation techniques used to measure asset and liability fair values on a recurring basis 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the amounts at fair value as of january  as required by sfas  assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment  and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels 
the determination of fair values incorporates various factors required under sfas these factors include not only the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements  but also the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
the objective of sfas r is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a company provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
under sfas r  a company would be required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies and contingent consideration measured at their fair value at the acquisition date 
it further requires that research and development assets acquired in a business combination that have no alternative future use be measured at their acquisition date fair value and then immediately charged to expense  and that acquisition related costs are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
among other changes  this statement would 
table of contents also require that negative goodwill be recognized in earnings as a gain attributable to the acquisition  and any deferred tax benefits resulting from a business combination be recognized in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
the objective of this statement is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a company provides in its consolidated financial statements 
sfas requires a company to clearly identify and present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company s equity 
it also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income  that changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly  as equity transactions  and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  that any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities in march  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas 
sfas expands the disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
about an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities to include more detailed qualitative disclosures and expanded quantitative disclosures 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations 
employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets fsp r 
fsp r will require additional disclosures about the major categories of plan assets and concentrations of risk  as well as disclosure of fair value levels  similar to the disclosure requirements of sfas the enhanced disclosures about plan assets required by fsp r must be provided in our annual report on form k for the year ending january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
our risk management control system uses analytical techniques including market value  sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations 
foreign exchange risk we sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars  however  we purchase some raw materials  pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  european euro  mexican peso and japanese yen against the us dollar 
we use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our forward and option contracts 
at january   the potential change in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments  assuming a adverse change in the underlying currency price  was million 

table of contents interest rates we are required under the senior secured credit facility and the second lien credit facility to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate debt issuance 
at january   we have outstanding hedging arrangements whereby we capped the libor interest rate component on million of our floating rate debt at 
we also entered into interest rate swaps tied to the month and month libor rates whereby we fixed the libor interest rate component on an aggregate of billion of our floating rate debt at a blended rate of approximately 
approximately of our total debt outstanding at january  is at a fixed or capped rate 
after giving effect to these arrangements  a basis point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of january  would result in a change in annual interest expense of million 
due to the recent significant changes in the credit markets  the fair values of our interest rate hedging instruments have decreased approximately million during the year ended january  this activity has been deferred into accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet until the hedged transactions impact our earnings 
commodities cotton  which represents of our cost of sales  is the primary raw material we use to manufacture many of our products 
while we attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton through short term supply agreements and hedges from time to time  our business can be adversely affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices 
the price of cotton currently in our inventory is in the mid cents per pound range which is the price that will impact our operating results in the first half of the prices for the most recent cotton crop  which will impact our operating results in the second half of  have decreased to the low cents per pound range 
the ultimate effect of these pricing levels on our earnings cannot be quantified  as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain  but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products  such as chemicals  dyestuffs  polyester yarn and foam 
we generally purchase our raw materials at market prices 
we use commodity financial instruments to hedge the price of cotton  for which there is a high correlation between costs and the financial instrument 
we generally do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge other raw material commodity prices 
at january   we did not have any cotton commodity derivatives outstanding
