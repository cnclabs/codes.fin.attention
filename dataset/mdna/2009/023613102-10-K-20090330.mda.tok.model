regulation and supervision the company expects competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
technological advances  for example  have lowered barriers to entry  allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks 
changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks  securities firms and insurance companies  which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry

dividends 
the federal reserve board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses the federal reserve board s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends

the federal reserve board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve board order  directive  or any condition imposed by  or written agreement with  the federal reserve board 
this requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that are well capitalized  well managed and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues 

table of contents acquisitions

in evaluating such transactions  the federal reserve board considers such matters as the financial and managerial resources of and future prospects of the companies involved  competitive factors and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served 
bank holding companies may acquire additional banks in any state  subject to certain restrictions such as deposit concentration limits 
with certain exceptions  the bhca prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company  or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or providing services for its subsidiaries 
the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non bank activities  which  by statute or by federal reserve board regulation or order  have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking 
the activities of the company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the bhca and the related federal reserve board regulations 
the gramm leach bliley act of authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions  including being well capitalized and well managed  to opt to become a financial holding company  and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted 
such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking 
the federal reserve board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity  or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary  when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company 
under the change in bank control act of the cbca  a day prior written notice must be submitted to the federal reserve board if any person including a company  or any group acting in concert  seeks to acquire of any class of the company s outstanding voting securities  unless the federal reserve board determines that such acquisition will not result in a change of control of the bank

under indiana banking law  prior approval of the indiana department of financial institutions is also required before any person may acquire control of an indiana bank  bank or bank holding company 
the department will issue a notice approving the transaction if it determines that the persons proposing to acquire the savings bank  bank or bank holding company are qualified in character  experience and financial responsibility  and the transaction does not jeopardize the interests of the public 
capital requirements 
the federal reserve board has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies  which require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk weighted assets 
these requirements are substantially similar to those applicable to the bank 
see regulation and supervision of the bank capital requirements 

table of contents regulation and supervision of the bank general 
the bank  as an indiana chartered savings bank  is subject to extensive regulation by the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic 
the lending activities and other investments of the bank must comply with various regulatory requirements 
the indiana department of financial institutions and fdic periodically examine the bank for compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the bank must file reports with the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic describing its activities and financial condition 
the bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the federal reserve board 
this supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors 
certain of these regulatory requirements are referred to below or appear elsewhere in this form k 
the regulatory discussion  however  does not purport to be an exhaustive treatment of applicable laws and regulations and is qualified in its entirety be reference to the actual statutes and regulations 
the bank s prospective conversion from an indiana savings bank to an indiana commercial bank is not expected to materially change the regulatory requirements applicable to the bank 
federal banking law capital requirements 
under fdic regulations  state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital requirement consisting of a ratio of tier capital to total assets of if the fdic determines that the institution is not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and has well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and in general  a strong banking organization  rated composite under the uniform financial institutions rating system the camels rating system established by the federal financial institutions examination council 
for all but the most highly rated institutions meeting the conditions set forth above  the minimum leverage capital ratio is 
tier capital is the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock including any related surplus and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus all intangible assets other than certain mortgage servicing assets  purchased credit card relationships  credit enhancing interest only strips and certain deferred tax assets  identified losses  investments in certain financial subsidiaries and non financial equity investments 
in addition to the leverage capital ratio the ratio of tier i capital to total assets  state chartered nonmember banks must maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  of which at least half must be tier capital 
qualifying total capital consists of tier capital plus tier capital also referred to as supplementary capital items 
tier capital items include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative preferred stock and preferred stock with a maturity of over years  certain other capital instruments and up to of pre tax net unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
the includable amount of tier capital cannot exceed the institution s tier capital 
qualifying total capital is further reduced by the amount of the bank s investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes  reciprocal cross holdings of capital securities issued by other banks  most intangible assets and certain other deductions 
under the fdic risk weighted system  all of a bank s balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk weight categories from to  based on the regulators perception of the risks inherent in the type of assets or item 
the aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category 
the sum of these weighted values equals the bank s risk weighted assets 
at december   the bank s ratio of tier capital to total assets was  its ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was and its ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets was 
investment activities 
since the enactment of federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  all state chartered fdic insured banks have generally been limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks  notwithstanding state law 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act and the fdic regulations permit exceptions to these limitations 
the fdic is authorized to permit such institutions to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks other than non subsidiary equity investments if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the bank insurance fund 
the fdic has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments 
the gramm leach bliley act of specifies that a 
table of contents non member bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes 
interstate banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of permitted bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state subject to specified concentration limits and other conditions 
the interstate banking act also authorizes the interstate merger of banks 
in addition  among other things  the interstate banking act permits banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that such action is specifically authorized by the law of the host state 
dividend limitations 
the bank may not pay dividends on its capital stock if its regulatory capital would thereby be reduced below the amount then required for the liquidation account established for the benefit of certain depositors of the bank at the time of its conversion to stock form 
in addition  the bank may not pay dividends that exceed retained net income for the applicable calendar year to date  plus retained net income for the preceding two years without prior approval from the indiana department of financial institutions 
at december   the shareholders equity of the bank was million 
earnings of the bank appropriated to bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes are not available for payment of cash dividends or other distributions to stockholders without payment of taxes at the then current tax rate by the bank on the amount of earnings removed from the reserves for such distributions 
see federal and state taxation 
under fdic regulations  the bank is prohibited from making any capital distributions if  after making the distribution  the bank would fail to meet any applicable capital requirements 
for additional information about dividend limitations see note in the consolidated financial statements 
insurance of deposit accounts 
the deposits of the bank are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic 
the deposit insurance fund is the successor to the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund  which were merged in under the fdic s risk based assessment system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned  with less risky institutions paying lower assessments 
for  assessments ranged from five to forty three basis points of assessable deposits 
due to losses incurred by the deposit insurance fund from failed institutions in  and anticipated future losses  the fdic has adopted  pursuant to a restoration plan to replenish the fund  an across the board seven basis point increase in the assessment range for the first quarter of the fdic has proposed further refinements to its risk based assessment system that would be effective april  and would effectively make the range eight to basis points 
the fdic has also imposed a special emergency assessment of basis points of assessable deposits  as of june   to cover the losses to the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic may adjust the scale uniformly from one quarter to the next  except that no adjustment can deviate more than three basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking 
no institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment 
due to the recent difficult economic conditions  deposit insurance per account owner has been raised to  for all types of accounts until january  in addition  the fdic adopted an optional temporary liquidity guarantee program by which  for a fee  noninterest bearing transaction accounts would receive unlimited insurance coverage until december  and certain senior unsecured debt issued by institutions and their holding companies between october  and june  would be guaranteed by the fdic through june  the bank made the business decision to participate in the unlimited noninterest bearing transaction account coverage  and the bank and the company opted to participate in the unsecured debt guarantee program 
federal law also provided a one time credit for eligible institutions based on their assessment base as of december  subject to certain limitations  credits could be used beginning in to offset assessments until exhausted 
the bank s remaining one time credit balance as of december  was  federal law also provides for the possibility that the fdic may pay dividends to insured institutions once the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio equals or exceeds of estimated insured deposits 

table of contents in addition to the assessment for deposit insurance  institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund 
this payment is established quarterly and during the calendar year ending december  averaged basis points of assessable deposits 
the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
prompt corrective regulatory action 
the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees if the institution would thereafter fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution may be i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
the capital restoration plan must include a guarantee by the institution s holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until it has been adequately capitalized on average for four consecutive quarters  under which the holding company would be liable up to the lesser of of the institution s total assets or the amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance as of the date it failed to comply with its capital restoration plan 
a significantly undercapitalized institution  as well as any undercapitalized institution that does not submit an acceptable capital restoration plan  may be subject to regulatory demands for recapitalization  broader application of restrictions on transactions with affiliates  limitations on interest rates paid on deposits  asset growth and other activities  possible replacement of directors and officers  and restrictions on capital distributions by any bank holding company controlling the institution 
any company controlling the institution may also be required to divest the institution or the institution could be required to divest subsidiaries 
the senior executive officers of a significantly undercapitalized institution may not receive bonuses or increases in compensation without prior approval and the institution is prohibited from making payments of principal or interest on its subordinated debt 
at their discretion  the federal banking regulators may also impose the foregoing sanctions on an undercapitalized institution if the regulators determine that such actions are necessary to carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective provisions 
if an institution s ratio of tangible capital to total assets falls below the critically undercapitalized level established by law  ie  a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of or less  the institution will be subject to conservatorship or receivership within specified time periods 
tangible equity is defined as core capital plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus less all intangible assets other than qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain purchased mortgage servicing rights 
under the implementing regulations  the federal banking regulators generally measure an institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
the following table shows the capital ratios required for the various prompt corrective action categories 
well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than tier risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than leverage ratio or more or more less than less than if institution has a composite camels rating 

table of contents the fdic may reclassify a well capitalized depository institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory actions applicable to institutions in the next lower capital category but may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized if the fdic determines  after notice and an opportunity for a hearing  that the savings institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or that the institution has received and not corrected a less than satisfactory rating for any camels rating category 
safety and soundness guidelines 
each federal banking agency was required to establish safety and soundness standards for the depository institutions under its authority 
the interagency guidelines require depository institutions to maintain internal controls and information systems and internal audit systems that are appropriate for the size  nature and scope of the institution s business 
the guidelines also establish certain basic standards for loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure and asset growth 
the guidelines further provide that depository institutions should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation  fees and benefits that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss  and should take into account factors such as compensation practices at comparable institutions 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that a depository institution is not in compliance with the safety and soundness guidelines  it may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the guidelines 
a depository institution must submit an acceptable compliance plan to its primary federal regulator within days of receipt of a request for such a plan 
failure to submit or implement a compliance plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
management believes that the bank meets all the standards adopted in the interagency guidelines 
enforcement 
the fdic has extensive enforcement authority over nonmember insured state banks  including the bank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
the fdic has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances 
the fdic is required  with certain exceptions  to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non member bank if that banks was critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning days after the date on which the institution became critically undercapitalized 
the fdic may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non member institution under specific circumstances on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of other events  including insolvency  substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices  existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business  and insufficient capital  or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance 
reserve requirements 
under federal reserve board regulations  the bank currently must maintain average daily reserves equal to of net transaction accounts over million up to million  plus on the remainder 
this percentage is subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a noninterest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution s interest earning assets 
at december   the bank met applicable federal reserve board reserve requirements

an application to branch must also be approved by the fdic 
lending limits 
indiana banks are not subject to percentage of asset or capital limits on their commercial  consumer and non residential mortgage lending  and accordingly  have more flexibility in structuring their portfolios than federally chartered savings banks 
indiana law provides that a bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a borrower or group of borrowers in excess of of its unimpaired capital and surplus 
an additional of capital and surplus may be lent if secured by specified readily marketable collateral

federal taxation 
the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return on a calendar year end 
saving banks are subject to the provisions of the internal revenue code of the code in the same general manner as other corporations 
however  institutions  such as the bank  which met certain definitional tests and other conditions prescribed by the code benefited from certain favorable provisions regarding their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve

risk factors an investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks 
before deciding to invest in our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this form k  including the items included as exhibits 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings 
our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investment less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
our net interest margin is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding 
changes in interest rates up or down could adversely affect our net interest margin and  as a result  our net interest income 
although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates  one can rise or fall faster than the other  causing our net interest margin to expand or contract 
our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates 
as a result  when interest rates rise  our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets  causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up 
changes in the slope of the yield curve or the spread between short term and long term interest rates could also reduce our net interest margin 
normally  the yield curve is upward sloping  meaning short term rates are lower than long term rates 
because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  when the yield curve flattens or even inverts  we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets 
for further discussion on how changes in interest rates could impact us  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition interest rate risk 
our increased emphasis on commercial and construction lending may expose us to increased lending risk 
at december   our loan portfolio consisted of million  or  of commercial real estate loans  million  or  of construction loans  and million  or  of commercial and industrial loans 
we intend to continue to increase our emphasis on the origination of commercial and construction lending 
however  these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property  the income stream of the borrowers and  for construction loans  the accuracy of the estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
commercial and industrial loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower s business and are secured by non real estate collateral that may depreciate over time 
in addition  since such loans generally entail greater risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans 
also  many of our commercial and construction borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 
our level of non performing loans and classified assets expose us to increased lending risks 
further  our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
at december   our nonperforming loans totaled million  representing of total loans 
in addition  loans that we 
table of contents have classified as substandard totaled million  representing of total loans 
if these loans do not perform according to their terms and the collateral is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance  we may experience loan losses  which could have a material effect on our operating results 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including our historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and estimated collateral values  to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other factors 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  our actual losses may vary from our current estimates 
at december   our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 
our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our cost of operations is high relative to our assets 
our failure to maintain or reduce our operating expenses costs could hurt our profits 
our operating expenses  which consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment expense  professional fees and data processing expense  totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our efficiency ratio totaled for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we continue our concerted effort to effectively manage our expenses  as is evidenced by the improvement realized in our efficiency ratio in compared to  that was due primarily to a net interest income growth rate that exceeded the growth rate for operating expenses 
however  the failure to control our expenses could hurt our profits 
future fdic assessments will hurt our earnings 
in february  the fdic adopted an interim final rule imposing a special assessment on all insured institutions due to recent bank and savings association failures 
the emergency assessment amounts to basis points of insured deposits as of june  the assessment will be collected on september  the special assessment will negatively impact the company s earnings and the company expects that the special assessment will amount to approximately  in addition  the interim rule would also permit the fdic to impose additional emergency special assessments after june   of up to basis points per quarter if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance or as a result of deterioration in the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio due to institution failures 
any additional emergency special assessments imposed by the fdic will further hurt the company s earnings 
additionally  the federal deposit insurance corporation increased the assessment rates for deposits by seven basis points for the first quarter of the fdic has the authority to further increase insurance assessments  which would have an adverse impact on our non interest expenses and results of operations 
if we do not achieve profitability on our new offices  it may negatively impact our earnings 
we opened a new loan production office in carmel  indiana in april  a new full service banking center in fishers  indiana in november  and another in carmel in january we also expect to open a new full service banking center in westfield  indiana in the second quarter of numerous factors will impact the performance of a new office  such as a suitable location  competition from other financial institutions  qualified personnel and an effective marketing strategy 
additionally  it takes time for a new office to generate significant deposits and loans to 
table of contents produce enough income to offset expenses  some of which  like salaries and occupancy expense  are relatively fixed costs 
we expect that it may take a period of time before our new offices can become profitable 
during this period  operating these new offices may negatively impact our net income 
if the value of real estate in central indiana were to decline materially  a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
with most of our loans concentrated in central indiana  a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans 
a decline in property values would diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral  making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans 
additionally  a decrease in asset quality could require additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses  which would hurt our profits 
also  a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse 
real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions  including  among other things  changes in general or regional economic conditions  governmental rules or policies and natural disasters 
our business is subject to the success of the local economy in which we operate 
because the majority of our borrowers and depositors are individuals and businesses located and doing business in central indiana our success significantly depends to a significant extent upon economic conditions in central indiana 
adverse economic conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate  affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  high interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international disorders  terrorism and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our profitability 
we are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses caused by adverse market or economic conditions in indiana could adversely affect the value of our assets  revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  we cannot give any assurance we will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur 
strong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth 
we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
this competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and has occasionally forced us to offer higher deposit rates 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits  which reduces net interest income 
according to the fdic  as of june   we held of the deposits in henry county  indiana  which was the largest market share of deposits out of the five financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
we also held of the deposits in hancock county  indiana  which was the fourth largest market share of deposits out of the financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide 
we expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area 
the trading history of our common stock is characterized by low trading volume 
our common stock may be subject to sudden decreases 
although our common stock trades on the nasdaq global market  it has not been regularly traded 
we cannot predict whether a more active trading market in our common stock will occur or how liquid that market might become 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time  which presence is dependent upon the individual decisions of investors  over which we have no control 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in interest rates  changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate  
table of contents press releases  announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors  future sales of our common stock  changes in economic conditions in our marketplace  general conditions in the us economy  financial markets or the banking industry  and other developments affecting our competitors or us 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance  and could prevent you from selling your common stock at or above the price you desire 
in addition  the stock markets  from time to time  experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our trading performance 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the indiana department of financial institutions  its chartering authority  and by the fdic  as insurer of its deposits 
the company is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage  and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and for the depositors and borrowers of the bank 
the regulation and supervision by the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic are not intended to protect the interests of investors in the company s common stock 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and indiana law  as well as state and federal banking regulations  could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the corporate law of the state of indiana could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations  the election of directors to staggered terms of three years  and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that shareholders may act on at shareholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to indiana laws  including one that prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of five years from the date the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 
we may require additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we anticipate that we have adequate capital for the foreseeable future 
based on this determination and an assessment that the restrictions contained in the troubled asset relief program s capital purchase program could adversely affect our ability to successfully operate our business  our board of directors determined not to participate in the capital purchase program  even though it had been preliminarily approved 
however  we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth or if we incur significant loan or securities impairment 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to us or on financial terms that were comparable to that offered through the capital purchase program 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth could be materially impaired

our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds primarily in mortgage loans on single family residences  multi family  construction loans  commercial real estate loans  and  to a lesser extent  commercial and industrial loans  small business lending  home improvement  and consumer loans

our primary source of borrowings is federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
through our subsidiaries  we engage in insurance and investment and brokerage activities 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest expense incurred on our deposits and borrowing portfolios 
our loan portfolio typically earns more interest than the investment portfolio  and our deposits typically have a lower average rate than fhlb advances 
several factors affect our net interest income 
these factors include the loan  investment  deposit  and borrowing portfolio balances  their composition  the length of their maturity  re pricing characteristics  liquidity  credit  and interest rate risk  as well as market and competitive conditions 

table of contents financial challenges  strategies and results in recent years in  the company incurred a net loss of million  which represented a million decline from the prior year and was due primarily to four factors 
first  a flattening of the us treasury yield curve and the related impact on other market interest rates resulted in new rates for the bank s loans and deposits that further narrowed our net interest margin 
second  in the fourth quarter  management implemented a balance sheet restructuring strategy that involved the sale of million of low yielding us government agency securities  which resulted in a loss of  third  also in the fourth quarter  a  loss was recorded due to million in investment securities being classified as other than temporarily impaired 
fourth  the drop in net income from the prior year was also the result of earnings being inflated by the after tax benefit of million in lease settlements during that year 
although the loss on sales of investment securities from the balance sheet restructuring strategy had a negative impact on earnings  positive results associated with the strategy were realized throughout and additionally  the loan portfolio expansion of million   in did not have a full year impact on earnings  but it established a stronger base for future earnings growth 
in  the company produced net income of million  which represented a million improvement over the million loss recorded in net income in benefited from a million settlement related to our litigation against rli insurance co 
rli over surety guarantees for certain lease pools in which ameriana bank had previously invested 
the positive impact from the rli settlement in was offset in part by million in charge offs  most of which occurred later in the year when the economic climate worsened 
during  the bank continued its balance sheet restructuring strategy that was initiated in late and involved principally the redeployment of funds from lower yielding investment securities into higher yielding loans  and it was the primary reason that net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis improved basis points from for to for as a result of this improvement in net interest margin  we were able to grow net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis by million without the benefit of balance sheet growth  as total assets actually were reduced by million  or 
as part of the bank s efforts to expand its commercial lending capabilities  we opened a commercial lending center in the fast growing suburban area of carmel  indiana 
this office and the bank s continued emphasis on commercial lending contributed to the loan growth realized during the year 
also in  our re branding of the company included the roll out of a new logo and image campaign 
these new initiatives continue to provide significant value to the company moving forward 
executive overview of the company recorded net income of  or per share for  which followed net income of million  or per share for that benefited from the million settlement of litigation related to lease pools

total non performing loans of million  or of total net loans at december   represented a million increase from december  the increase in non performing loans was primarily due to the classification of a multi family loan of million in anderson  indiana  the classification of two land development loans totaling million  and an increase in

critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  and such estimates and assumptions are integral to the understanding of reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each quarter based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience 
the allowance recorded for non commercial loans is based on an analysis of loan mix  risk characteristics of the portfolio  fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences and historical losses  adjusted for current trends  for each loan category or group of loans 
the allowance for loan losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans  or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger  non homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 

table of contents mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for msrs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of msrs requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets 
valuation measurements 
valuation methodologies often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued 
investment securities and residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value  as defined in sfas no 
fair value measurement sfas no 
 which requires key judgments affecting how fair value for such assets and liabilities is determined 
in addition  the outcomes of valuations have a direct bearing on the carrying amounts for goodwill and intangibles assets 
to determine the values of these assets and liabilities  as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired  management makes assumptions and estimates related to discount rates  asset returns  prepayment rates and other factors 
the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results  which could affect the corporation s results of operations 
financial condition total assets increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to growth in investment securities and the loan portfolio  and the addition of properties for new banking centers 
cash and cash equivalents total cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from million at december  cash on hand and in other institutions decreased  or  to million at december  this change was due to a  decrease in our book balance for the noninterest earning piece of our federal reserve bank account  which primarily represents deposits in transit 
interest bearing deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  the higher balance as of december  was due primarily to proceeds realized by the bank s investment subsidiary from sales and maturities of investment securities

securities investment securities increased million to million at december   from million at december  and there was a material change in the investment mix 
mortgage backed securities increased million to million  while municipal securities declined million to million  primarily through a second quarter sale of million designed to support the bank s income tax and liquidity strategies 
the growth in mortgage backed securities resulted primarily from a first quarter purchase of million of fannie mae securities and a third quarter purchase of million of ginnie mae securities the third quarter purchase was funded with fhlb borrowings and a million repurchase agreement embedded with two interest rate caps totaling million in notional value 
the interest rate caps are designed to provide protection against a negative impact on the company s net interest income that could result from rising interest rates 
these interest rate caps are considered to be clearly and closely related to the host instrument 
all mortgage backed securities at december  are insured by either ginnie mae  fannie mae or freddie mac 
at december   all investments remained classified as available for sale 
all of our investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment  and such impairment  if any  is recognized as a charge to earnings

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the current period credit or cost associated with maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  assessment by management  third parties and banking regulators of the quality of the loan portfolio  the value of the underlying collateral on problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market areas 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we had a provision for loan losses of million for compared to a credit of million for the provision for reflected additional loan growth  the increase in nonperforming loans and the increasing pressure of current economic conditions on credit quality 
the credit in was the result of the million loss recovery from the settlement of the rli litigation

we started recording a valuation allowance against our current period state income tax benefit in due to our concern that we may not be able to use more than the tax asset already recorded on the books without modifying the use of aimi  our investment subsidiary 
operating income from aimi is not subject to state income taxes under current state law  and is the primary reason for the tax asset

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future obligations of a short term nature 
historically  funds provided by operations  loan repayments and new deposits have been our principal sources of liquid funds 
in addition  we have the ability to obtain funds through the sale of new mortgage loans  through borrowings from the fhlb system  and through the brokered certificates market 
we regularly adjust the investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability program 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding and million of additional commitments for line of credit receivables 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these maturing certificates of deposit do not remain with us  other sources of funds must be used  including other certificates of deposit  brokered cds  and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than currently paid on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  however  based on past experiences we believe that a significant portion of the certificates of deposit will remain 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
we held no brokered cds at either december  or december  our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and purchase of securities 
in  our loan originations totaled million  and we also purchased million of loans from brokers and one million participation loan from another financial institution 
financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and fhlb advances

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same rate as changes in the prices of goods and services  which are directly affected by inflation  although interest rates may fluctuate in response to perceived changes in the rate of inflation
