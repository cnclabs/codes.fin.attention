risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this annual report  including the financial statements and related notes  when deciding to invest in us 
you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
some  but not all  of the important risks which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by forward looking statements made by us include the following we might fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the opening of tandy leather retail stores or we might be unable to obtain sufficient new locations on acceptable terms to meet our growth plans 
further  we might fail to hire and train competent managers to oversee the stores opened 
continued weakness in the economy in the united states  as well as abroad  may cause our sales to decrease or not to increase or adversely affect the prices charged for our products 
also  hostilities  terrorism or other events could worsen this condition 
negative trends in general consumer spending levels  including the impact of the availability and level of consumer debt and levels of consumer confidence could adversely affect our sales 
political considerations here and abroad could disrupt our sources of supplies from abroad or affect the prices we pay for goods 
continued involvement by the united states in war and other military operations in the middle east and other areas abroad could disrupt international trade and affect our inventory sources 
as a result of the on going threat of terrorist attacks on the united states  consumer buying habits could change and decrease our sales 
livestock diseases such as mad cow could reduce the availability of hides and leathers or increase their cost 
also  the prices of hides and leathers fluctuate in normal times  and these fluctuations can affect us 
if  for whatever reason  the costs of our raw materials and inventory increase  we may not be able to pass those costs on to our customers 
other factors could cause either fluctuations in buying patterns or possible negative trends in the craft and western retail markets 
in addition  our customers may change their preferences to products other than ours  or they may not accept new products as we introduce them 
any change in the commercial banking environment may affect us and our ability to borrow capital as needed 
other uncertainties  which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control  may occur as well

summary we are the world s largest specialty retailer and wholesale distributor of leather and leathercraft related items 
our operations are centered on operating retail and wholesale stores 
we have built our business by offering our customers quality products in one location at competitive prices 
the key to our success is our ability to grow our base business 
we grow that business by opening new locations and by increasing sales in our existing locations 
we intend to continue to expand both domestically  in the short term  and internationally  in the long term 
we operate in four segments 
first  wholesale leathercraft  consisting of our leather factory stores and our national account group  is the largest source of our revenues million in 
this division has generally offered steady but modest increases in sales 
sales in declined 
the wholesale stores sales declined compared to and national account sales were down 
much of the sales decline at the stores is attributed to an overall weakness in consumer spending  which results in fewer purchases of our products by small businesses 
the decline in national account sales is related to weaker consumer spending as well as the expected decline in sales to one customer who stopped purchasing from us in the first quarter of since acquiring its assets in  we have focused on re establishing tandy leather as the operator of retail leathercraft stores 
these retail stores comprise our second segment  retail leathercraft 
because of growth here  this segment has experienced the greatest increases in sales million in  up from million in 
our business plan calls for opening an average of stores annually as we work toward a goal of stores from stores at the end of we have slowed down our new store openings in recent years due to the general economic conditions in the us we plan to open new stores in  one of which was opened in the first quarter 
our third segment is international leathercraft  which consists of stores located outside of north america 
currently  we have one retail wholesale combination store located in the united kingdom  which was opened in february it is our intention to add more stores to this segment once we have a large enough customer base to support additional stores 
we refer to our fourth segment as other 
it consists of roberts  cushman  a supplier of trimmings for headwear 
its operations are not material to us 
on a consolidated basis  a key indicator of costs  gross margin as a percent of total net sales  held steady in and increased in operating expenses as a percent of total net sales in increased from operating expenses increased as a percentage of total net sales in when compared with the increase in operating expenses in was due to our delayed response to cut expenses on weaker than expected sales  particularly in the second and third quarters 
we were much more successful in our control of operating expenses in  given the continued weak sales environment 
we reported consolidated net income for of million 
consolidated net income for and was million and million  respectively 
we have used our cash flow to fund our operations  to fund the opening of new tandy leather stores  to purchase necessary property and equipment and make acquisitions of small competitors in the retail and wholesale market 
in  we incurred million in bank debt to purchase a  square foot building to house our corporate headquarters and central support units 
we moved into that facility in the first quarter of at the end of  our stockholders equity had increased to million from million the previous year 
comparing the december  balance sheet with the prior year s balance sheet  we reduced our investment in inventory from million to million  while total cash including certificates of deposit and other short term investments increased from million from million 

table of contents net sales net sales for the three years ended december  were as follows year wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft international leathercraft other total company incr decr from prior year our net sales fell by in when compared with and grew by in when compared with the sales decline resulted primarily from our wholesale leathercraft segment  offset somewhat by an increase in retail leathercraft sales and the sales from our new international leathecraft segment  although sales at our retail stores have slowed down somewhat due to an overall slowdown in consumer spending in and the reduction in sales in our wholesale stores is also the result of the overall economic slowdown in the us costs and expenses in general  our gross profit as a percentage of sales our gross margin fluctuates based on the mix of customers we serve  the mix of products we sell and our ability to source products globally 
our negotiations with suppliers for lower pricing are an on going process  and we have varying degrees of success in those endeavors 
sales to retail customers tend to produce higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers due to the difference in pricing levels 
therefore  as retail sales increase in the overall sales mix  higher gross margins tend to follow 
finally  there is significant fluctuation in gross margins between the various merchandise categories we offer 
as a result  our gross margins can vary depending on the mix of products sold during any given time period 
for  our cost of sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to  resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from to 
our total cost of sales as a percentage of our total net sales held steady from to  resulting in a consolidated gross profit margin at in both years 
increases in gross margin are primarily due to increased retail sales from year to year 
our gross margins for the three years ended december  were as follows year wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft international leathercraft other total company our operating expenses increased as a percentage of total net sales to in when compared with in this increase indicates that our operating expenses grew faster than our sales during this period

we had a currency exchange gain of  in compared to  in net income during  we earned net income of million  a decline over our net income of million earned during the decline in net income was the result of the decrease in gross profit and the decrease in other income  partially offset by the reduction in income tax expense 
during  we earned net income of million  a decline from our net income of million earned during the decline in net income was the result of the increase in operating expenses at a higher rate than that of our sales  partially offset by the reduction in income tax expense

sales in the wholesale stores decreased in compared to sales in while the sales decline in our national account group was 
by customer group  we had sales declines in all groups 
the most significant decreases were in our wholesale and manufacturer groups 
the customers of these groups are small businesses and have been significantly affected by the weakness in our economy 
our sales mix by customer group in the wholesale leathercraft division was as follows customer group retail institution wholesale national accounts manufacturers the decrease in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from a decrease of in gross margin as a percentage of sales compared with  offset partially by a decrease of in operating expenses as a percent of sales 
significant operating expense decreases occurred in employee compensation and benefits  outside services  and freight out 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in depreciation expense  and property taxes  both due to the purchase of our corporate facility 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from a decrease of in gross margin as a percentage of sales compared with  and an increase of in operating expenses as a percent of sales

we intend to continue the expansion of tandy leather s retail store chain in by opening approximately new stores  one of which was opened in the first quarter 
we remain committed to a conservative expansion plan for this division that minimizes risks to our profits and maintains financial stability 
in the current economic environment in the us  it is possible that we will change our plans for store openings in if we determine that the us retail sector can not support additional store openings at that time 
international leathercraft international leathercraft consists of all stores located outside of north america 
currently  that represents one retail wholesale combination store located in the united kingdom

proceeds in the amount of  were used to fund the initial purchase of the property 
on april   that amount was rolled into a ten year term note  and we began making monthly debt service payments in may we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the jpmorgan chase credit agreement and have no reason to believe that we will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements 
the principal terms and conditions of the credit agreement are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  notes payable and long term debt 
reflecting the borrowing and reduction of bank indebtedness during the periods  our financing activities for  and provided required net cash of million  million  and  respectively 
our primary source of liquidity and capital resources during was cash flow provided by operating activities 
cash flow from operations for and was million and million  respectively  the largest portion being generated from net income 
this net income was partially offset by the decrease in accrued expenses in and the decrease of accounts receivable and inventory in cash flow from operations in was million 
consolidated accounts receivable decreased significantly to million at december  compared to million at december  average days to collect accounts improved from days in to days in on a consolidated basis 
as evidenced by the significant reduction in our accounts receivable at the end of  we have tightened our credit policy and are aggressively monitoring our customer accounts to ensure collectibility 
we believe the trend in our collections is the result of the overall slowdown in the us economy 
many of our customers with open accounts are very small businesses  and they tend to feel the effects of an economic slowdown more severely than larger businesses 
inventory decreased from million at the end of to million at december  we expect our inventory to slowly trend upward as we continue our expansion of the tandy leather store chain 
in  we expect minimal increases in our inventory due to the expected weaknesses in our sales and the limited number of retail stores we plan to open 
we attempt to manage our inventory levels to avoid tying up excessive capital while maintaining sufficient inventory in order to service our current customer demand as well as plan for our expected store growth and expansion 
we believe our investment in inventory at the end of was at a very reasonable level given our expansion plans as it was in line with our internal targets of optimum inventory levels 
consolidated inventory turned times during  virtually the same as in at times 
we compute our inventory turnover rates as sales divided by average inventory 
by operating division  inventory turns are as follows segment wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft international leathercraft n a n a roberts  cushman wholesale leathercraft stores only retail leathercraft inventory turns are significantly higher than that of wholesale leathercraft because its inventory consists only of the inventory at the stores 
the retail stores have no warehouse backstock inventory to include in the turnover computation as the stores get their product from the central warehouse 
wholesale leathercraft s turns are expected to be slower because the central warehouse inventory is part of this division and its inventory is held as the backstock for all of the stores 
accounts payable decreased slightly to million at the end of compared to million at the end of as discussed above  the largest use of operating cash in was in the reduction of accounts payable 
cash paid for capital expenditures totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total capital expenditures both cash and non cash totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the primary capital expenditure was the purchase of the land and building to house our corporate offices and central support departments for million 
other capital expenditures were factory machines and dies  fixtures and equipment for the new tandy leather retail stores  various store fixtures and computer equipment at existing stores  computer system upgrade for advertising department  computer equipment for future stores  and miscellaneous computer and other office equipment 
in  the primary capital expenditure was the remodel and retrofit of the building for million 
other capital expenditures were factory machines and dies  and computer equipment 
although we intend to continue opening or acquiring new tandy leather retail stores and therefore expenditures related to this expansion should continue into  we do expect our capital expenditures to be substantially less than that of as the expenditures related to our building have been completed 

table of contents cash applied toward stock repurchases in totaled  we believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in  while also funding our limited expansion plans 
at this time  we know of no trends or demands  commitments events or uncertainties that will or are likely to materially affect our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
in addition  we anticipate that this cash flow will enable us to meet the contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we could defer expansion plans if required by unanticipated drops in cash flow 
in particular  because of the relatively small investment required by each new retail store  we have flexibility in when we make most expansion expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during  and  and we do not currently have any such arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes by years our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  not including related interest expense payments due by periods contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations our loan from jpmorgan chase matures in may these are our leased facilities 
summary of critical accounting policies we strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner  although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology 
we follow generally accepted accounting principles in the us in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these principles require us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 
basis of consolidation 
we report our financial information on a consolidated basis 
therefore  unless there is an indication to the contrary  financial information is provided for the parent company  tandy leather factory  inc  and its subsidiaries as a whole 
transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose 
we own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated 
none of our subsidiaries are off balance sheet 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for retail over the counter sales as transactions occur and other sales upon shipment of our products  provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon shipment 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances  product returns  and allowances for defective merchandise 
allowance for accounts receivable 
we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition  past collection history  and the aging of the account 
if the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment or inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is accounted for on the first in  first out method 
this means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold 
in addition  we regularly reduce the value of our inventory for slow moving or obsolete inventory 
this reduction is based on our review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand 
if actual future demand is less favorable than what we project  additional write downs may be necessary 
goods shipped to us are recorded as inventory owned by us when the risk of loss shifts to us from the supplier 
goodwill 
we periodically analyze the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet to determine the appropriateness of its carry value 
as of december   we determined that the present value of the discounted estimated future cash flows of the stores associated with the goodwill is sufficient to support their respective goodwill balances 
if actual results of these stores differ significantly from our projections  such difference could affect the present value calculation in the future resulting in an impairment of all or part of the goodwill currently carried on our balance sheet 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this annual report and other materials we file with the sec  or in other written or oral statements made or to be made by us  other than statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
words such as may  assume  forecast  position  predict  strategy  expect  intend  plan  estimate  anticipate  believe  project  budget  potential  or continue  and similar expressions are used to identify forward looking statements 
they can be affected by assumptions used or by known or unknown risks or uncertainties 
consequently  no forward looking statements can be guaranteed 
actual results may vary materially 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
you should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements including the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
we do not intend to update forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movement in foreign current exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material impact on our financial results 
we do not use or invest in market risk sensitive instruments to hedge any of these risks or for any other purpose 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiaries in canada and the united kingdom as those subsidiaries have local currency revenue and local currency operating expenses 
changes in the currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of revenue and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  segment information  for financial information concerning our foreign activities 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on certain outstanding debt 
however  our current credit agreement with jpmorgan chase includes a fixed interest rate 
therefore  changes in the prime rate do not impact us in this area
