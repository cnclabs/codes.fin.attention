item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview constellation energy group  inc constellation energy is an energy company that conducts its business through various subsidiaries including a merchant energy business and baltimore gas and electric company bge 
we describe our operating segments in note to consolidated financial statements 
this report is a combined report of constellation energy and bge 
references in this report to we and our are to constellation energy and its subsidiaries  collectively 
references in this report to the regulated business es are to bge 
we discuss our business in more detail in item business section and the risk factors affecting our business in item a 
risk factors section 
in this discussion and analysis  we will explain the general financial condition of and the results of operations for constellation energy and bge including factors which affect our businesses  our earnings and costs in the periods presented  changes in earnings and costs between periods  sources of earnings  impact of these factors on our overall financial condition  expected sources of cash for future capital expenditures  our net available liquidity and collateral requirements  and expected future expenditures for capital projects 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income loss  which present the results of our operations for   and we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of our consolidated statements of income loss 
we have organized our discussion and analysis as follows first  we discuss our strategy 
then  we describe the business environment in which we operate including how recent events  competition  regulation  weather  and other factors affect our business 
next  we discuss our critical accounting policies 
these are the accounting policies that are most important to both the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
we highlight significant events that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
we review our results of operations beginning with an overview of our total company results  followed by a more detailed review of those results by operating segment 
we review our financial condition addressing our sources and uses of cash  security ratings  capital resources  capital requirements  commitments  and off balance sheet arrangements 
we conclude with a discussion of our exposure to various market risks 
strategy we are pursuing a strategy of operating nuclear and non nuclear generation facilities  providing energy and energy related products and services through our customer supply activities  and delivering electricity and gas to customers of bge  our regulated utility located in central maryland 
our merchant energy business focuses on short term and long term purchases and sales of energy  capacity  and related products to various customers  including distribution utilities  municipalities  cooperatives  and industrial  commercial  and governmental customers 
we obtain this energy from both owned and contracted supply resources 
our generation fleet is strategically located in deregulated markets and includes various fuel types  such as nuclear  coal  natural gas  oil  and renewable sources 
in addition to owning generating facilities  we contract for power from other merchant providers  typically through power purchase agreements 
we use both our owned generation and our contracted generation to support our wholesale and retail customer supply operations 
we are also in the forefront of the proposed development of new nuclear generation in the united states through our unistar nuclear energy joint venture with edf group and related entities edf 
in addition  in december  we entered into an investment agreement with edf to sell to edf a interest in our nuclear generation and operation business investment agreement 
edf brings operational experience  global scale  and procurement leverage to the development of new nuclear plants in the united states and to the operation of our existing nuclear plants 
this new joint venture is expected to close in the third quarter of  subject to receipt of regulatory approvals 
collectively  the integration of owned and contracted electric generation assets with origination  fuel procurement  and risk management expertise allows our merchant energy business to earn incremental margin and more effectively manage energy and commodity price risk over geographic regions and time 
our focus is on providing solutions to customers energy needs  and our customer supply and global commodities operations add value to our owned and contracted generation assets by providing national market access  market infrastructure  real time market intelligence  risk management and arbitrage opportunities  and transmission and transportation expertise 
generation capacity supports our customer supply and global commodities operations by providing a source of reliable power supply 
we expect bge and our customer supply operation to grow through focused and disciplined expansion 
at bge  we are also focused on enhancing reliability  customer satisfaction  and customer demand response initiatives 
customer choice  regulatory change  and energy market conditions significantly impact our business 
in response  we regularly evaluate our strategies with these goals in mind to improve our competitive position  to anticipate and adapt to the business environment and regulatory changes  and to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit quality through the use of a financial model that applies cash flow to reduce debt 

table of contents as a result of the significant events of as discussed in the business environment section  we are actively seeking to increase available liquidity and reduce our business risk 
over the next one to two years  we expect to be in a transition period during which we will focus on executing the following objectives that we believe will strengthen the company continuing to implement strategic initiatives to reduce collateral and liquidity needs of our merchant energy business  including selling certain assets and operations as discussed further in the divestitures section in item working to close the sale to edf of of our nuclear generation and operation business as expeditiously as possible  continuing a disciplined approach to the management of collateral and liquidity  including pricing new business to reflect the full cost of capital in the current economic environment and possibly requiring deposits from new retail customers that do not meet pre existing credit conditions  balancing cash generation with earnings growth  and maintaining a liquidity cushion in excess of credit rating downgrade collateral requirements  focusing on constellation energy s core strengths of owning  developing  and operating nuclear and non nuclear generation assets  providing reliable  regulated utility service to customers  leveraging our expertise in managing physical risks inherent in our generation and customer supply operations  and maintaining strong supply relationships with retail and wholesale customers  continuing to reduce the scale of and re focus the activities of our global commodities and customer supply operations through the following actions using the global commodities group to support our generation and customer supply operations  placing less reliance on proprietary trading  investing capital in areas where we are able to generate appropriate risk adjusted returns  maintaining credit metrics consistent with investment grade ratings 
the execution of our strategy in the future will be affected by our ability to achieve these goals as well as by continued instability in financial and commodities markets 
execution of our goals  including the pending asset divestitures  could have a substantial effect on the nature and mix of our business activities  as well as our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
in addition  upon closing the transaction contemplated by our investment agreement with edf  we expect to deconsolidate our subsidiary that owns our nuclear generation assets 
in turn  this could affect our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows in material amounts  and these amounts could vary substantially from historical results 
business environment various factors affect our financial results 
we discuss some of these factors in more detail in item business competition section 
we also discuss these various factors in the forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors sections 
during the last year  two events significantly influenced our business environment the collapse of the credit markets and the extreme volatility in the energy markets 
throughout  volatility in the financial markets intensified  leading to dramatic declines in equity prices and substantially reducing liquidity in the credit markets 
most equity indices declined significantly  the cost of credit default swaps and bond spreads increased substantially  and credit markets effectively ceased to be accessible for all but the most highly rated borrowers 
major financial institutions experienced significant financial difficulty  and widespread fears developed about the viability of any business that required access to credit markets to support liquidity needs or that required substantial access to the capital markets to function  including constellation energy 
by mid september  despite having announced a number of actions to address our liquidity situation  we faced a sudden and immediate need to raise equity capital and take other steps to enhance our overall liquidity 
as a result  on september   we entered into a definitive merger agreement with midamerican energy holdings company midamerican to acquire constellation energy for billion  which also provided us with an immediate billion cash infusion 
in december  however  we terminated the merger agreement with midamerican and entered into an agreement to sell a interest in our nuclear generation and operation business for billion to edf 
under that agreement  edf provided us with a billion cash infusion to replace the investment made by midamerican 
we repaid midamerican s billion plus interest in january we discuss the termination of the merger with midamerican and our transaction with edf in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the volatility of the global energy markets impacts our liquidity and collateral requirements as well as our credit risk 
we discuss our liquidity and collateral requirements in the financial condition section 
we continue to actively manage our credit risk to attempt to reduce the impact of a potential counterparty default 
we discuss our customer counterparty credit and other risks in more detail in the risk management section 
competition we face competition in the sale of electricity  natural gas  coal  and uranium in wholesale energy markets and to retail customers 
various states have moved to restructure their retail electricity and gas markets 
the pace of deregulation in these states varies based on historical moves to competition and responses to recent market events 
while many states continue to support or expand retail competition and industry restructuring  other states that were considering deregulation 
table of contents have slowed their plans or postponed consideration 
in addition  other states are reconsidering deregulation 
specifically  legislatures in a number of states are currently considering  to varying degrees  legislation to either eliminate or expand retail choice programs 
in addition  many states have initiated proceedings to reconsider the method of wholesale procurement for meeting their utilities default provider of last resort polr requirements 
both the reconsideration of retail choice and possible new methodologies for wholesale procurement could affect our customer supply operation s future opportunities to service commercial and industrial customers and the ability to provide wholesale products to utilities 
the outcome of these efforts cannot be predicted  but they could have a material effect on our financial results 
all bge electricity and gas customers have the option to purchase electricity and gas from alternate suppliers 
we discuss merchant competition in more detail in item business competition section 
the impacts of electric deregulation on bge in maryland are discussed in item business baltimore gas and electric company electric business electric competition section 
regulation maryland maryland psc in addition to electric restructuring  which we discuss in item business electric competition section  regulation by the maryland public service commission maryland psc significantly influences bge s businesses 
the maryland psc determines the rates that bge can charge customers of its electric distribution and gas businesses 
the maryland psc incorporates into bge s standard offer service rates the transmission rates determined by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
bge s electric rates are unbundled in customer billings to show separate components for delivery service ie base rates  electric supply commodity charge and transmission  a universal service surcharge  and certain taxes 
the rates for bge s regulated gas business continue to consist of a delivery charge base rate and a commodity charge 
maryland settlement agreement in march  constellation energy  bge  and a constellation energy affiliate entered into a settlement agreement with the state of maryland  the maryland psc and certain state of maryland officials to resolve pending litigation and to settle other prior legal  regulatory  and legislative issues 
on april   the governor of maryland signed enabling legislation  which became effective on june  pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement each party acknowledged that the agreements adopted in relating to maryland s electric restructuring law are final and binding and the maryland psc will close ongoing proceedings relating to the settlement 
bge provided its residential electric customers approximately million in the form of a one time per customer rate credit 
we recorded a reduction to electric revenues on our and bge s consolidated statements of income loss during the second quarter of and reduced customers bills by the amount of the credit between september and december bge customers are relieved of the potential future liability for decommissioning constellation energy s calvert cliffs unit and unit  scheduled to occur no earlier than and  respectively  and are no longer obligated to pay a total of million  in dollars adjusted for inflation  pursuant to the maryland psc order regarding the deregulation of electric generation 
bge will continue to collect the million annual nuclear decommissioning charge from all electric customers through and continue to rebate this amount to residential electric customers  as previously required by maryland senate bill  which was enacted in june bge resumed collection of the residential return portion of the administrative charge included in standard offer service sos rates  which had been eliminated under senate bill  on june  and will continue collection through may  without having to rebate it to all residential electric customers 
this will total approximately million over this period 
this charge will be suspended from june  through december  any electric distribution base rate case filed by bge will not result in increased distribution rates prior to october  and any increase in electric distribution revenue awarded will be capped at with certain exceptions 
any subsequent electric distribution base rate case may not be filed prior to august  the agreement does not govern or affect our ability to recover costs associated with gas rates  federally approved transmission rates and charges  electric riders  tax increases  or increases associated with standard offer service power supply auctions 
effective june   bge implemented revised depreciation rates for regulatory and financial reporting purposes 
the revised rates reduced depreciation expense by approximately million in without impacting distribution rates charged to customers 
effective june   maryland laws governing investments in companies that own and operate regulated gas and electric utilities were amended to make them less restrictive with respect to certain capital stock acquisition transactions 
constellation energy elected two independent directors to the board of directors of bge within the required six months from the execution of the settlement agreement 

table of contents senate bills and in june  maryland senate bill was enacted  which among other things imposed rate stabilization measures that i capped rate increases by bge for residential sos service at from july  to may   ii gave residential sos customers the option from june  until december  of paying a full market rate or choosing a short term rate stabilization plan in order to provide a smooth transition to market rates without adversely affecting the creditworthiness of bge  and iii provided for full market rates for all residential sos service starting january   and allowed bge to recover the costs deferred from july  to may  from its customers over a period not to exceed years  on terms and conditions to be determined by the maryland psc  including through the issuance of rate stabilization bonds that securitize the deferred costs 
in connection with these provisions of senate bill in may  the maryland psc approved a plan to allow residential electric customers to defer the transition to full market rates from june  to january  the percent of customers who chose to defer are repaying the deferred amounts without interest over a twenty one month period which began on april  in june  a subsidiary of bge issued an aggregate principal amount of million of rate stabilization bonds to recover costs relating to the residential rate deferral from july  to may  we discuss the rate stabilization bond issuance in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
in april  maryland senate bill was enacted  which made certain modifications to senate bill pursuant to senate bill  the maryland psc was required to initiate several studies  including studies relating to stranded costs  the costs and benefits of various options for re regulation  and the structure of the electric industry in maryland 
in december  the maryland psc issued an interim report addressing the costs and benefits of various options for re regulation and recommending actions to be taken to address an anticipated shortage of generation and transmission capacity in maryland  which included implementation of demand response initiatives and requiring utilities to enter into long term power purchase contracts with suppliers 
the maryland psc issued a final report in december in the final report  the maryland psc does not recommend returning the former utility generation assets to full cost of service regulation  but rather recommends incremental  forward looking re regulation when appropriate to ensure a reliable supply of electricity or to obtain economic benefits for customers 
the report also indicates that the maryland psc will investigate in whether  and on what terms  additional generation should be built in maryland 
in addition  the maryland legislature continues to review the structure of the maryland energy markets and the need for re regulation 
we cannot at this time predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries  studies  and recommendations or their actual effect on our  or bge s financial results  but it could be material 
we discuss the market risk of our regulated electric business in more detail in the risk management section 
base rates base rates are the rates the maryland psc allows bge to charge its customers for the cost of providing them delivery service  plus a profit 
bge has both electric base rates and gas base rates 
bge may ask the maryland psc to increase base rates from time to time 
the maryland psc historically has allowed bge to increase base rates to recover its utility plant investment and operating costs  plus a profit 
generally  rate increases improve the earnings of our regulated business because they allow us to collect more revenue 
however  rate increases are normally granted based on historical data and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs 
other parties may petition the maryland psc to decrease base rates 
bge s most recently approved return on electric distribution rate base was approved in 
bge s most recently approved return on gas rate base was approved in 
according to the terms of the maryland settlement agreement  any future electric distribution base rate case filed by bge will not result in increased distribution rates prior to october  and any increase in electric distribution revenue awarded will be capped at with certain exceptions 
any subsequent electric distribution base rate case may not be filed prior to august  the agreement does not govern or affect our ability to recover costs associated with gas rates  federally approved transmission rates and charges  electric riders  tax increases  or increases associated with standard offer service power supply auctions 
revenue decoupling beginning in  the maryland psc approved  and bge implemented  revenue decoupling for residential and small commercial customers to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on its electric distribution volumes 
this means that bge s electric distribution revenues from residential and small commercial customers reflect weather and usage that is considered normal for the month 
therefore  these revenues are affected primarily by customer growth 
the maryland psc approved revenue decoupling for the majority of our remaining commercial and industrial customers beginning february  we have a similar revenue decoupling mechanism in our gas business 
demand response and advanced metering programs in order to implement an advanced metering pilot program and a demand response program  bge defers costs associated with these programs as a regulatory asset and recovers these costs from customers in future periods 
we discuss the advanced metering and demand response programs in more detail in item business baltimore gas and electric company electric load management 

table of contents electric commodity and transmission charges we discuss bge electric commodity and transmission charges standard offer service  including the impact of the enactment of senate bill in maryland  in the business environment regulation maryland senate bills and section 
gas commodity charge bge charges its gas customers separately for the natural gas they purchase 
the price bge charges for the natural gas is based on a market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss market based rates in more detail in the regulated gas business gas cost adjustments section and in note to consolidated financial statements 
federal regulation ferc the ferc has jurisdiction over various aspects of our business  including electric transmission and wholesale natural gas and electricity sales 
bge transmission rates are updated annually based on a formula methodology approved by ferc 
the rates also include transmission investment incentives approved by ferc in orders issued in july and november of we believe that ferc s continued commitment to fair and efficient wholesale energy markets should continue to result in improvements to competitive markets across various regions 
since  operation of bge s transmission system has been under the authority of pjm interconnection pjm  the regional transmission organization rto for the mid atlantic region  pursuant to ferc oversight 
as the transmission operator  pjm administers the energy markets and conducts day to day operations of the bulk power system 
the liability of transmission owners  including bge  and power generators is limited to those damages caused by the gross negligence of such entities 
in addition to pjm  rtos exist in other regions of the country such as the midwest  new york  and new england 
similar to pjm  these rtos also administer the energy market for their region and are responsible for operation of the transmission system and transmission system reliability 
our merchant energy business participates in these regional energy markets 
these markets are continuing to develop  and revisions to market structure are subject to review and approval by ferc 
we cannot predict the outcome of any reviews at this time 
however  changes to the structure of these markets could have a material effect on our financial results 
ferc initiatives ongoing initiatives at ferc have included a review of its methodology for the granting of market based rate authority to sellers of electricity 
ferc has established interim tests that it uses to determine the extent to which companies may have market power in certain regions 
where ferc finds that market power exists  it may require companies to implement measures to mitigate the market power in order to maintain market based rate authority 
we believe that our entities selling wholesale power continue to satisfy ferc s test for determining whether to grant a public utility market based rate authority 
in november  ferc eliminated through and out transmission rates between the midwest independent system operator miso and pjm and put in place seams elimination charge cost adjustment assignment seca transition rates  which are paid by the transmission customers of miso and pjm and allocated among the various transmission owners in pjm and miso 
the seca transition rates were in effect from december  through march  ferc set for hearing the various compliance filings that established the level of the seca rates and has indicated that the seca rates are being recovered from the miso and pjm transmission customers subject to refund by the miso and pjm transmission owners 
we are a recipient of seca payments  payer of seca charges  and supplier to whom such charges may be shifted 
administrative hearings regarding the seca charges concluded in may  and an initial decision from the ferc administrative law judge alj was issued in august the decision of the alj generally found in favor of reducing the overall seca liability 
the decision  if upheld  is expected to significantly reduce the overall seca liability at issue in this proceeding 
however  the alj also allowed seca charges to be shifted to upstream suppliers  subject to certain adjustments 
therefore  certain charges could be shifted to our wholesale marketing  risk management  and trading operation 
this decision will be reviewed by ferc 
we are unable to predict the timing or final outcome of ferc s seca rate proceeding 
however  as the amounts collected under the seca rates are subject to refund and the ultimate outcome of the proceeding establishing seca rates is uncertain  the result of this proceeding may have a material effect on our financial results 
capacity markets in april  ferc issued an initial order approving pjm s proposal to restructure its capacity market  which establishes the method by which we are paid for making generating plant capacity available to pjm 
the capacity market or reliability pricing model rpm was approved by ferc in december after settlement proceedings 
ferc in june and november upheld the rpm settlement in response to requests for rehearing 
an appeal of ferc s decisions on rpm was filed in january in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
currently  we cannot predict with certainty what effect the results of these challenges will have on our  or bge s  financial results 
also in january in connection with rpm  pjm filed revisions to its capacity market rules to reflect increased construction costs for new entry of generation cone  which was rejected by ferc in april cone is used in determining the price paid to capacity resources that clear in the pjm capacity auction 
in september  ferc directed pjm to consider revisions and improvements to rpm to become effective prior to the may auction 
in december  pjm filed proposed tariff changes to rpm with ferc 
pjm proposes significant revisions to rpm  including the determination of cone  the participation of energy efficiency and demand resources  and market power and mitigation rules 

table of contents we cannot predict the outcome of the ferc proceeding 
however  the outcome could have a material effect on our financial results depending on the nature of the resulting changes to rpm 
in may  five state public service commissions  including the maryland psc  consumer advocates  and others filed a complaint against pjm at the ferc  alleging that the rpm produced unreasonable prices during the period from june  through may  the complaint requests that ferc establish a refund effective date of june   reject the results of the through rpm capacity auction results  and significantly reduce prices for capacity beginning as of june  through we  along with other power suppliers and supplier trade groups  have filed protests to the complaint 
in september  ferc dismissed the complaint and in october  the complainants requested a rehearing at ferc 
we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or the amount of refunds that may be owed by or due to us  if any 
however  the outcome  and any refunds that are ultimately assessed  could have a material impact on our financial results 
three major  high voltage transmission lines have been announced that could enhance significantly the transfer capacity of the pjm transmission system from west to east 
the siting process either in the states or at ferc is uncertain  as is the likelihood that one or more of the transmission lines will be ultimately constructed 
the construction of the transmission lines  which could depress both capacity and energy prices for generation located in maryland and elsewhere in the eastern part of pjm  could have a material effect on our financial results 
other market changes are routinely proposed and considered on an ongoing basis 
such changes will be subject to ferc s review and approval 
we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the possible effect on our  or bge s  financial results at this time 
nerc reliability standards in compliance with the energy policy act of  ferc has approved the north american electric reliability corporation nerc as the national energy reliability organization 
nerc will be responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system 
we are responsible for complying with the standards in the regions in which we operate 
nerc will have the ability to assess financial penalties for noncompliance  which could be material 
weather merchant energy business weather conditions in the different regions of north america influence the financial results of our merchant energy business 
weather conditions can affect the supply of and demand for electricity  natural gas  and fuels 
changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot market and the forward market  which may affect our results in any given period 
typically  demand for electricity and its price are higher in the summer and the winter  when weather is more extreme 
the demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter 
however  all regions of north america typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time  thus we are not typically exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of our business at once 
bge weather affects the demand for electricity and gas for our regulated businesses 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase demand 
mild weather reduces demand 
weather affects residential sales more than commercial and industrial sales  which are mostly affected by business needs for electricity and gas 
the maryland psc has approved revenue decoupling mechanisms which allow bge to record monthly adjustments to the majority of our regulated electric and gas business distribution revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns 
we discuss this further in the regulation maryland psc revenue decoupling  regulated electric business revenue decoupling and regulated gas business revenue decoupling sections 
other factors a number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for our merchant energy business 
these factors include seasonal  daily  and hourly changes in demand  number of market participants  extreme peak demands  available supply resources  transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions  location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving obligations  implementation of new market rules governing operations of regional power pools  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations  and international supply and demand 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems  local transportation systems  and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation 
other factors also impact the demand for electricity and gas in our regulated businesses 
these factors include the number of customers and usage per customer during a given period 
we use these terms later in our discussions of regulated electric and gas operations 
in those sections  we discuss how these and other 
table of contents factors affected electric and gas sales during the periods presented 
the number of customers in a given period is affected by new home and apartment construction and by the number of businesses in our service territory 
usage per customer refers to all other items impacting customer sales that cannot be measured separately 
these factors include the strength of the economy in our service territory 
when the economy is healthy and expanding  customers tend to consume more electricity and gas 
conversely  during an economic downturn  our customers tend to consume less electricity and gas 
environmental matters and legal proceedings we discuss details of our environmental matters in note to consolidated financial statements and item business environmental matters section 
we discuss details of our legal proceedings in note to consolidated financial statements 
some of this information is about costs that may be material to our financial results 
accounting standards adopted and issued we discuss recently adopted and issued accounting standards in note to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including our reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income loss  our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates 
management believes the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates  in note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for derivatives and hedging activities we utilize a variety of derivative instruments in order to manage commodity price risk  interest rate risk  and foreign currency risk 
the accounting requirements for derivatives are governed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted 
because of the extensive nature of its requirements that govern both accounting treatment and documentation  as well as the complexity of the transactions within its scope  applying sfas no 
requires management to exercise judgment in several areas  including the following identification of derivatives  selection of accounting treatment for derivatives  valuation of derivatives  and impact of uncertainty 
as discussed in more detail below  the exercise of management s judgment in these areas materially impacts our financial statements 
while we believe we have appropriate controls in place to apply sfas no 
 failure to meet its requirements  even inadvertently  could require the use of a different accounting treatment for the affected transactions 
in addition  interpretations of sfas no 
continue to evolve  and a future change in accounting requirements also could affect our financial statements materially 
we discuss derivatives and hedging activities in more detail in note and note to consolidated financial statements 
identification of derivatives we must evaluate new and existing transactions and agreements to determine whether they are derivatives 
identifying derivatives requires us to exercise judgment in interpreting the definition of a derivative in sfas no 
and applying that definition to each individual contract 
if a contract is not a derivative  we cannot apply sfas no 
 and we generally must record the effects of the contract in our financial statements upon delivery or settlement under the accrual method of accounting 
in contrast  if a contract is a derivative  we must apply sfas no 
 which provides for several possible accounting treatments as discussed more fully under accounting treatment below 
as a result  the required accounting treatment and its impact on our financial statements can vary substantially depending upon whether a contract is a derivative or a non derivative 
accounting treatment sfas no 
permits several possible accounting treatments for derivatives that meet all of the applicable requirements of that standard 
sfas no 
requires mark to market as the default accounting treatment for all derivatives unless they qualify  and we affirmatively designate them  for one of the other accounting treatments 
derivatives designated for any of the other elective accounting treatments must meet specific  restrictive criteria prescribed by sfas no 
 both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis 

table of contents the permissible accounting treatments for derivatives are mark to market  cash flow hedge  fair value hedge  and accrual accounting under normal purchase normal sale npns 
each of the accounting treatments that we use for derivatives affects our financial statements in substantially different ways as summarized below recognition and measurement accounting treatment balance sheet income statement mark to market recorded at fair value changes in fair value recognized in earnings cash flow hedge recorded at fair value effective changes in fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ineffective changes in fair value recognized in earnings amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income reclassified to earnings when the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings or becomes probable of not occurring fair value hedge recorded at fair value changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability recorded as adjustment to its book value changes in fair value recognized in earnings changes in fair value of hedged asset or liability recognized in earnings npns accrual fair value not recorded accounts receivable or accounts payable recorded when derivative settles changes in fair value not recognized in earnings revenue or expense recognized in earnings when underlying physical commodity is sold or consumed we exercise judgment in determining which derivatives qualify for a particular accounting treatment under the provisions of sfas no 
and its interpretations  including cash flow and fair value hedges determination that all hedge accounting requirements are satisfied  including the expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value from the risk being hedged and  for cash flow hedges  the probability that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur 
accrual accounting under npns determination that the derivative will result in gross physical delivery of the underlying commodity and will not settle net 
we also exercise judgment in selecting the accounting treatment that we believe provides the most transparent presentation of the economics of the underlying transactions 
although contracts may be eligible for hedge accounting or npns designation  sfas no 
does not require all such contracts to be designated and accounted for identically 
we generally elect accrual or hedge accounting for our physical energy delivery activities generation and customer supply because accrual accounting more closely aligns the timing of earnings recognition  cash flows  and the underlying business activities 
by contrast  we generally apply mark to market accounting for risk management and trading activities because changes in fair value more closely reflect the economic performance of the activity 
however  we also use mark to market accounting for the following physical energy delivery activities our nonregulated retail gas customer supply activities  which are managed using economic hedges that we have not designated as cash flow hedges so as to match the timing of recognition of the earnings impacts of those activities to the greatest extent permissible  and economic hedges of activities that require accrual accounting for which the related hedge requires mark to market accounting 

table of contents as a result of making these judgments  the selection of accounting treatments has a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
these impacts affect several components of our financial statements  including assets  liabilities  and accumulated other comprehensive income 
additionally  the selection of accounting treatment also affects the amount and timing of the recognition of earnings 
the following table summarizes these impacts accounting treatment effect of changes in fair value on mark to market cash flow hedge fair value hedge npns assets and liabilities increase or decrease in derivatives increase or decrease in derivatives increase or decrease in derivatives decrease or increase in hedged asset or liability no impact accumulated other comprehensive income aoci no impact increase or decrease for effective portion of hedge no impact no impact earnings prior to settlement increase or decrease increase or decrease for ineffective portion of hedge increase or decrease for change in derivatives decrease or increase for change in hedged asset or liability increase or decrease for ineffective portion no impact earnings at settlement no impact amounts in aoci reclassified to earnings when hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings hedged margin recognized in earnings revenue or expense recognized in earnings when underlying physical commodity is sold or consumed valuation sfas no 
requires us to record mark to market and hedge derivatives at fair value  which represents an exit price for the asset or liability from the perspective of a market participant 
an exit price is the price at which a market participant could sell an asset or transfer a liability to an unrelated party 
while some of our derivatives relate to commodities or instruments for which quoted market prices are available from external sources  many other commodities and related contracts are not actively traded 
additionally  some contracts include quantities and other factors that vary over time 
in these cases  we must use modeling techniques to estimate expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both in order to determine fair value 
the prices  quantities  and other factors we use to determine fair value reflect management s best estimates of inputs a market participant would consider 
we record valuation adjustments to reflect uncertainties associated with estimates inherent in the determination of fair value that are not incorporated in market price information or other market based estimates we use to determine fair value 
to the extent possible  we utilize market based data together with quantitative methods for both measuring the uncertainties for which we record valuation adjustments and determining the level of such adjustments and changes in those levels 
we discuss fair value measurements in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the judgments we are required to make in order to estimate fair value have a material impact on our financial statements 
these judgments affect the selection  appropriateness  and application of modeling techniques  the methods used to identify or estimate inputs to the modeling techniques  and the consistency in applying these techniques over time and across types of derivative instruments 
changes in one or more of these judgments could have a material impact on the valuation of derivatives and  as a result  could also have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
impacts of uncertainty the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities involves significant judgment and requires the use of estimates that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported amounts of revenues and costs and could be affected by many factors including  but not limited to  the following uncertainty surrounding inputs to the estimates of fair value required by sfas no 
due to factors such as illiquid markets or the absence of observable market price information  our ability to continue to designate and qualify derivative contracts for npns accounting or hedge accounting under the requirements of sfas no 
 
table of contents potential volatility in earnings from ineffectiveness on derivatives for which we have elected hedge accounting  and our ability to enter into new mark to market derivative origination transactions 
evaluation of assets for impairment and other than temporary decline in value long lived assets we are required to evaluate certain assets that have long lives for example  generating property and equipment and real estate to determine if they are impaired when certain conditions exist 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  provides the accounting requirements for impairments of long lived assets 
we are required to test our long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes are a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition  an adverse action by a regulator or legislature or an adverse change in the business climate  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset  a current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses  or a change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for long lived assets that can be classified as held for sale  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent their carrying amount exceeds their fair value less costs to sell 
for long lived assets that we expect to hold and use  we recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the total undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
therefore  when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
this necessarily requires us to estimate uncertain future cash flows 
in order to estimate future cash flows  we consider historical cash flows and changes in the market environment and other factors that may affect future cash flows 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our earnings forecasts 
if we are considering alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset such as the potential sale of an asset  we probability weight the alternative courses of action to estimate the cash flows 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  and operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset  or if we have classified an asset as held for sale  we must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss 
the estimation of fair value also involves judgment 
we consider quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available 
in the absence of such information  we may consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
often  we will discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes 
the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as discussed above with respect to undiscounted cash flows 
actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
gas properties we evaluate unproved property at least annually to determine if it is impaired under sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing properties 
impairment for unproved property occurs if there are no firm plans to continue drilling  the lease is near its expiration  or historical experience necessitates a valuation allowance 
investments we evaluate our equity method and cost method investments for example  cep and partnerships that own power projects to determine whether or not they are impaired 
accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  provides the accounting requirements for these investments 
the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under apb no 
is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than a temporary decline in value 
the evaluation and measurement of impairments under the apb no 
standard involves the same uncertainties as described above for long lived assets that we own directly and account for in accordance with sfas no 
similarly  the estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subject to variation  and the impact of such variations could be material 
additionally  if the projects in which we hold these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
 we would record our proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate our investment for an other than temporary decline in value under apb no 

table of contents we continuously monitor issues that potentially could impact future profitability of our equity method investments that own geothermal  coal  hydroelectric  fuel processing projects  as well as our equity investments in our joint ventures and cep  including environmental and legislative initiatives 
we discuss certain risks and uncertainties in more detail in our forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors sections 
however  should future events cause these investments to become uneconomic  our investments in these projects could become impaired under the provisions of apb no 
current california statutes and regulations require load serving entities to increase their procurement of renewable energy resources and mandate statewide reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
given the need for electric power and the statutory and regulatory requirements increasing demand for renewable resource technologies  we believe california will continue to foster an environment that supports the use of renewable energy and continues certain subsidies that will make renewable energy projects economical 
however  should california legislation and regulatory policies and federal energy policies fail to adequately support renewable energy initiatives  our equity method investments in these types of projects could become impaired under the provisions of apb no 
 and any losses recognized could be material 
debt and equity securities our available for sale investments in debt and equity securities  primarily our nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets  are subject to impairment evaluations under fasb staff positions sfas no 
and sfas no 
fsp and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
fsp and require us to determine whether a decline in fair value of an investment below book value is other than temporary 
if we determine that the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment must be written down to fair value as a new cost basis 
for securities held in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund for which the market value is below book value  the decline in fair value for these securities is considered other than temporary and must be written down to fair value 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we account for goodwill and other intangibles under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we do not amortize goodwill 
sfas no 
requires us to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the business might be impaired 
goodwill is impaired if the carrying value of the business exceeds fair value 
annually  we estimate the fair value of the businesses we have acquired using techniques similar to those used to estimate future cash flows for long lived assets as discussed on the previous page  which involves judgment 
if the estimated fair value of the business is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is required to be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill is greater than its fair value 
asset retirement obligations we incur legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain long lived assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  provides the accounting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
we incur such legal obligations as a result of environmental and other government regulations  contractual agreements  and other factors 
the application of this standard requires significant judgment due to the large number and diverse nature of the assets in our various businesses and the estimation of future cash flows required to measure legal obligations associated with the retirement of specific assets 
fasb interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 clarifies that obligations that are conditional upon a future event are subject to the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the use of an expected present value methodology in measuring asset retirement obligations that involves judgment surrounding the inherent uncertainty of the probability  amount  and timing of payments to settle these obligations  and the appropriate interest rates to discount future cash flows 
we use our best estimates in identifying and measuring our asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
our nuclear decommissioning costs represent our largest asset retirement obligation 
this obligation primarily results from the requirement to decommission and decontaminate our nuclear generating facilities in connection with their future retirement 
we utilize site specific decommissioning cost estimates to determine our nuclear asset retirement obligations 
however  given the magnitude of the amounts involved  complicated and ever changing technical and regulatory requirements  and the long time horizons involved  the actual obligation could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
in view of the significant number of assumptions underlying the decommissioning cost estimate  our estimate of the future cost of decommissioning is likely to continue to change over time 
for perspective  a increase or decrease in our estimate of the future cost of decommissioning our nuclear plants would produce an approximately million change to our asset retirement obligation and an approximately million change in our total annual amortization and accretion expenses 
significant events execution and subsequent termination of merger agreement with midamerican on december   constellation energy and midamerican agreed to terminate the agreement and plan of merger the parties had entered into on september  as a result  we paid midamerican million to terminate the merger  and million in lieu of the number of shares of our common stock that were due to midamerican on conversion of the series a preferred stock but that could not be issued due to regulatory limitations

simultaneously  we signed a letter of intent to enter into a related transaction with an affiliate of the buyer under which that company would provide us with the gas supply needed to support our retail gas customer supply business  while reducing our credit requirements 
we expect that both of these sales will close by the end of the second quarter of  subject to certain regulatory approvals and other standard closing conditions 
collectively  we expect both divestitures to return approximately billion of currently posted collateral 
in addition  we expect these divestitures to further reduce our downgrade collateral requirements by approximately million

note provides a reconciliation of operating results by segment to our consolidated financial statements 
revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses our merchant energy business manages the revenues we realize from the sale of energy and energy related products to our customers and our costs of procuring fuel and energy 
the difference between revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses  including all direct expenses  represents the gross margin of our merchant energy business  and this measure is a useful tool for assessing the profitability of our merchant energy business 
accordingly  we believe it is appropriate to discuss the operating results of our merchant energy business by analyzing the changes in gross margin between periods 
in managing our portfolio  we may terminate  restructure  or acquire contracts 
such transactions are within the normal course of managing our portfolio and may materially impact the timing of our recognition of revenues  fuel and purchased energy expenses  and cash flows 
in the third quarter of  we changed the management of the wholesale procurement function for retail gas activities from our customer supply operation to our global commodities operation 
in connection with this change  we began to prospectively account for the underlying retail gas contracts as derivative contracts subject to mark to market accounting  under which changes in fair value are recorded in revenues as they occur 
this activity was previously accounted for on a gross basis and recorded in accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses 
the change to market to market accounting for this activity reduced both our accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses in and however  the change had a minimal impact on gross margin 
we discuss our merchant energy revenues  fuel and purchased energy expenses  and gross margin below 
revenues our merchant energy revenues decreased  million in compared to and increased  million in compared to primarily due to the following vs

table of contents gross margin we analyze our merchant energy gross margin in the following categories 
generation our operation that owns  operates  and maintains fossil  nuclear  and renewable generating facilities and holds interests in qualifying facilities  and power projects in the united states and canada 
we present the gross margin results of this operation based on a hedged assumption for the portfolio  related to both output from the facilities and the fuel used to generate electricity 
the assumption is based on executing hedges at current market prices with the global commodities operation at the end of each prior fiscal year in order to ensure that the generation operation is fully hedged 
therefore  all commodity price risk is managed by and presented in the results of our global commodities operation as discussed below 
changes in gross margin of our generation operation during the period are due to changes in the level of output from the generating assets  and changes in gross margin between years are a result of changes in prices and expected output 
customer supply our load serving operation that provides energy products and services to wholesale and retail electric and natural gas customers  including distribution utilities  cooperatives  aggregators  and commercial  industrial and governmental customers 
we present the gross margin results of this operation based on the gross margin value of new customer supply arrangements at the time of execution assuming an estimated level of customer usage and the impact of any changes in the underlying usage of the customers based on actual energy deliveries 
changes in estimated customer usage result from attrition customers changing suppliers or variable load risk changes in actual usage when compared to expected usage 
all commodity price risk is presented in and managed by our global commodities operation 
global commodities our marketing  risk management  and trading operation that manages contractually owned physical assets  including generation facilities  natural gas properties  international coal sourcing and freight assets  provides risk management services  uranium marketing services  and trades energy and energy related commodities 
this operation provides the wholesale risk management function for our generation and customer supply operations  as well as our structured products and energy investments portfolios  and includes our merchant energy business actual hedged positions with third parties 
therefore  changes in gross margin for this operation result mostly from changes in commodity prices and positions across the various commodities and regions in which we transact 
we provide a summary of our gross margin for these three components of our merchant energy business as follows dollar amounts in millions of total of total of total gross margin generation customer supply global commodities total in december  we completed the sale of these gas fired plants facility capacity mw unit type location high desert combined cycle california rio nogales combined cycle texas holland combined cycle illinois university park peaking illinois big sandy peaking west virginia wolf hills peaking virginia this sale impacted our results of operation and cash flows for when compared to we discuss the sale of these gas fired generating facilities in note to consolidated financial statements 
generation the million increase in generation gross margin in compared to is primarily due to the following million increase from higher energy prices for the output of our generating assets in the pjm and new york regions based on prices established at the end of see global commodities discussion below for impact of price changes during  and million of higher earnings for lower planned and unplanned outages at our nuclear and fossil plants 
the million increase in generation gross margin in compared to is primarily due to approximately million increase from higher energy prices for the output of our generating assets in the pjm and new york regions based on prices established at the end of see global commodities discussion below for impact of price changes during 
this increase was partially offset by lower gross margin due to the absence of approximately million of gross margin associated with the gas plants that were sold in december customer supply the million decrease in customer supply gross margin in compared to is primarily due to the following million of lower gross margin related to unfavorable price movements and lower volumes in our retail power operation  
table of contents million of lower gross margin related to lower realization of contracts executed in prior periods and lower new business originated and realized during the year at our wholesale power operation  and million of lower mark to market results in our retail gas operation 
we discuss this in more detail in the mark to market section 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of higher gross margin related to our retail gas operation primarily due to the acquisition of cornerstone energy on july  the million increase in customer supply gross margin in compared to is primarily due to approximately million of higher realization of contracts executed in prior periods and new contracts executed  including the portfolio of contracts acquired in the southeast united states  primarily for our wholesale and retail power operations 
these increases were partially offset by the following million of lower gross margin related to lower prices  partially offset by higher volumes related to our retail gas operation  and million of lower mark to market results in our retail gas operation 
we discuss this in more detail in the mark to market section 
global commodities we present global commodities results in the following categories portfolio management and trading our centralized risk management service related to energy price risk associated with our generation fleet  wholesale and retail customer supply business  and our structured products portfolio 
it also deploys risk capital in traded energy markets 
structured products customized risk management products in the power  gas  coal and freight markets eg  generation tolls  gas transport and storage  and global coal and freight logistics 
energy investments investments in energy assets that primarily include natural gas properties and a joint interest in an entity that owns dry bulk cargo vessels 
as previously discussed in the significant events section  the energy markets were affected by substantial volatility in commodity prices during these market impacts are reflected in the million decrease in gross margin from our global commodities operation during compared to the same period of primarily due to million of lower gross margin in our portfolio management and trading activities  partially offset by million of higher gross margin in our structured products portfolio and million of higher gross margin in our energy investments portfolio 
we discuss these changes below 
the million of lower gross margin related to our portfolio management and trading operation are due to the following million of lower gross margin related to our portfolio of contracts subject to mark to market accounting

million of lower gross margin related to portfolio management of positions arising from our generation  customer supply  structured products  and energy investments activities due to the impact of unfavorable changes in prices of power  natural gas  and coal on those positions see the description of the effects of pricing on generation and customer supply activities  million related to write downs of our emission allowance inventory to reflect current market price decreases 
we discuss this in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
million related to the bankruptcy of one of our domestic coal suppliers 
during the first quarter of  as a result of a default by the supplier  we terminated our derivative contracts with the supplier  reclassified the related asset to accounts receivable  and fully reserved the amount 
million related to losses recognized on hedges due to ineffectiveness and certain cash flow hedges that no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
on october   we discontinued the use of hedge accounting for derivative contracts that previously were accounted for as cash flow hedges within the international commodities operation 
from that date  subsequent changes in fair value of those derivative contracts have been recorded in earnings 
at december   we concluded that the combination of the decline in value associated with the previously hedged transactions together with the related balances remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income  would lead to the recognition of a net loss in one or more future periods 
as such  we recognized a loss of million during the fourth quarter of these decreases in gross margin related to our portfolio management and trading activities are partially offset by higher gross margin of million from gains in our structured products portfolio  consisting of approximately million as a result of the termination and sale of in the money energy purchase contracts  coal supply contracts  and freight contracts to eliminate or reduce operation and performance risk with certain counterparties  and approximately million related to higher realization of contracts executed in prior periods  and million in our energy investments operation primarily due to approximately million related to higher realization of contracts executed in prior periods and a million gain on sale of a dry bulk vessel in our shipping joint venture 
we discuss this sale in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the million decrease in gross margin from our global commodities operation in as compared to the same period in is primarily due to lower gross margin of million in our portfolio management and trading operation and million of lower gross margin in our structured products 
table of contents portfolio  partially offset by higher gross margin of million related to our energy investments portfolio 
we discuss these changes below 
the decrease in gross margin of million as a result of portfolio management and trading is primarily related to the following million related to losses recognized on hedges due to ineffectiveness and certain cash flow hedges that no longer qualified for hedge accounting during the year  million of lower gross margin related to portfolio management of positions arising from our generation  customer supply  and structured products activities due to the impact of unfavorable changes in prices of power  natural gas  and coal on those positions see the description of the effects of pricing on generation and customer supply activities in the preceding sections 
these decreases were partially offset by million of higher gross margin related to our portfolio of contracts subject to mark to market accounting  including higher earnings of million related to increased origination gains primarily associated with nonderivative contracts that were amended to reduce counterparty nonperformance risk  resulting in the contracts becoming derivatives for which mark to market accounting is required 
we discuss these transactions in more detail in the mark to market section  the decrease in gross margin of million for the structured products portfolio is primarily related to fewer contract terminations and sales during as compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase in gross margin of million from the energy investments portfolio  primarily related to the following million of earnings related to our natural gas properties  including the acquisition of working interests in gas producing fields in oklahoma 
we discuss this in more detail in the note to consolidated financial statements  and million due to higher realization from contracts executed in prior periods and higher new business originated and realized during the period 
mark to market mark to market results include net gains and losses from origination  trading  and risk management activities for which we use the mark to market method of accounting 
we discuss these activities and the mark to market method of accounting in more detail in the critical accounting policies section and in note to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the nature of our operations and the use of mark to market accounting for certain activities  mark to market earnings will fluctuate 
we cannot predict these fluctuations  but the impact on our earnings could be material 
we discuss our market risk in more detail in the risk management section 
the primary factors that cause fluctuations in our mark to market results are changes in the level and volatility of forward commodity prices and interest rates  counterparty creditworthiness  the number and size of our open derivative positions  and the number  size  and profitability of new transactions  including termination or restructuring of existing contracts 
as discussed earlier  we are currently assessing the ongoing capital requirements of the merchant energy business and are pursuing various alternative strategies 
additionally  we have focused our activities on reducing capital requirements  reducing long term economic risk  and reducing short term liquidity requirements 
these actions may impact the future results of the merchant energy business  particularly the size of and potential for changes in fair value of activities subject to mark to market accounting 
the primary components of mark to market results are origination gains and gains and losses from risk management and trading activities 
origination gains arise primarily from contracts that our global commodities operation structures to meet the risk management needs of our customers or relate to our trading activities 
transactions that result in origination gains may be unique and provide the potential for individually significant revenues and gains from a single transaction 
risk management and trading mark to market represents both realized and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the value of our portfolio  including the effects of changes in valuation adjustments 
in addition to our fundamental risk management and trading activities  we also use non trading derivative contracts subject to mark to market accounting to manage our exposure to changes in market prices as a result of our gas transportation and storage activities  while in general the underlying physical transactions related to our gas transportation and storage and freight activities are accounted for on an accrual basis 
we use other non trading derivative transactions subject to mark to market accounting to manage our exposure to changes in market prices related to our other activities that are accounted for on an accrual basis 
we discuss the changes in mark to market results below 
we show the relationship between our mark to market results and the change in our net mark to market energy asset later in this section 

table of contents mark to market results were as follows in millions unrealized mark to market results origination gains risk management and trading mark to market unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total risk management and trading mark to market total unrealized mark to market realized mark to market total mark to market results total unrealized mark to market is the sum of origination transactions and total risk management and trading mark to market 
total mark to market results decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of primarily due to unrealized changes in fair value 
the period to period variance in unrealized changes in fair value was primarily due to lower gains from unrealized changes in fair value of million from risk management and trading  partially offset by an increase in origination gains of million 
we discuss the increase in origination gains below 
the net decrease in risk management and trading gains of million was primarily due to million of increased losses primarily related to power and transmission trading activities in the northeast  pjm  and ercot regions due to unfavorable price movements  execution of transactions to reduce our risk position consistent with changes in our strategy  and execution of those transactions in less liquid market conditions  lower gains of million from our emissions trading activities due primarily to unfavorable price movements  and million of increased losses related to unfavorable price movements on certain economic hedges of accrual transactions  primarily related to gas transportation and storage and freight activities that do not qualify for or are not designated as cash flow hedges 
the risk management and trading results were partially offset by million of gains primarily as a result of favorable price movements relating to economic hedges which substantially increased in value as coal prices decreased in the fourth quarter of these positions were previously accounted for as cash flow hedges and were de designated due to the announced sale of our international commodities operation  and million of gains primarily related to our wholesale and retail gas businesses due to favorable price movements on our sales of wholesale and retail natural gas 
total mark to market results increased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of primarily due to higher gains from unrealized changes in fair value of million  and an increase in origination gains of million 
we discuss the increase in origination gains below 
the million in higher gains from unrealized changes in fair value was primarily driven by million of gains related to our emissions trading activities due primarily to favorable price movements  million of gains related to our coal and freight portfolio management and trading activities primarily due to favorable price movements  and million of gains related to power  transmission  and natural gas in the northeast  pjm  and ercot regions due to favorable price movements and increased volume 
these gains were partially offset by million of losses related to unfavorable price movements on certain economic hedges of accrual transactions that do not qualify for or are not designated as cash flow hedges  primarily relating to gas transportation and storage and freight activities 
origination gains arose primarily from transactions in  which are discussed in more detail below  and transaction in  which is discussed in more detail below 
the recognition of origination gains is generally dependent on the availability of sufficient observable market data that validates the initial fair value of the contract 
liquidity and market conditions impact our ability to identify sufficient  objective market price information to permit recognition of origination gains 
as a result  while our strategy and competitive position provide the opportunity to continue to originate such transactions  the level of origination gains we are able to recognize may vary from year to year as a result of the number  size  and market price transparency of the individual transactions executed in any period 
during  our global commodities operation amended certain nonderivative contracts to mitigate counterparty performance risk under the existing contracts 
as a result of these amendments  the revised contracts are derivatives subject to mark to market accounting under sfas no 
the change in accounting for these contracts from nonderivative to derivative resulted in substantially all of the origination gains for presented in the table above 
during  our global commodities operation amended certain nonderivative power sales contracts such that the new contracts became derivatives subject to mark to market accounting under sfas no 
simultaneous with the amending of the nonderivative contracts  we executed at current market prices several new offsetting derivative power purchase contracts subject to mark to market accounting 
the combination of these transactions resulted in substantially all of the origination gains presented for in the preceding table  
table of contents as well as mitigated our risk exposure under the amended contracts 
the origination gains in from these transactions was partially offset by approximately million of losses in our accrual portfolio due to the reclassification of losses related to cash flow hedges previously established for the amended nonderivative contracts from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings 
in the absence of these transactions  the economic value represented by the origination gains and the losses associated with cash flow hedges would have been recognized over the remaining term of the contracts  which extended through the first quarter of derivative assets and liabilities derivative assets and liabilities consisted of the following at december  in millions current assets noncurrent assets total assets current liabilities noncurrent liabilities total liabilities net derivative position composition of net derivative exposure hedges mark to market net cash collateral included in derivative balances net derivative position as discussed in our critical accounting policies section  our derivative assets and liabilities include contracts accounted for as hedges and those accounted for on a mark to market basis 
these amounts are presented in our consolidated balance sheets after the impact of netting  which is discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
due to the impacts of commodity prices  the number of open positions  master netting arrangements  and offsetting risk positions on the presentation of our derivative assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  we believe an evaluation of the net position is the most relevant measure  and is discussed in more detail below 
however  we present our gross derivatives as required by sfas no 
 fair value measurements  in note to consolidated financial statements 
the increase of million in our net derivative liability subject to hedge accounting since december  was due primarily to  million of unrealized losses associated with existing hedge positions due to unfavorable price changes 
these losses were partially offset by million related to the settlement of out of the money cash flow hedges during to the extent that these hedges are effective  these unrealized losses will be offset by unrealized gains on the related hedged transactions that will be realized when those transactions affect earnings 
we record any hedge ineffectiveness in earnings as it occurs 
the following are the primary sources of the change in our net derivative asset subject to mark to market accounting during and in millions fair value beginning of year changes in fair value recorded in earnings origination gains unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total changes in fair value changes in value of exchange listed futures and options net change in premiums on options contracts acquired other changes in fair value fair value at end of year changes in our net derivative asset subject to mark to market accounting that affected earnings were as follows origination gains represent the initial unrealized fair value at the time these contracts are executed to the extent permitted by applicable accounting rules 
unrealized changes in fair value represent unrealized changes in commodity prices  the volatility of options on commodities  the time value of options  and other valuation adjustments 
changes in valuation techniques represent improvements in estimation techniques  including modeling and other statistical enhancements used to value our portfolio to more accurately reflect the economic value of our contracts 
reclassification of settled contracts to realized represents the portion of previously unrealized amounts settled during the period and recorded as realized revenues 
the net mark to market derivative asset also changed due to the following items recorded in accounts other than in our consolidated statements of income loss changes in value of exchange listed futures and options are adjustments to remove unrealized revenue from exchange traded contracts that are included in nonregulated revenues 
the fair value of these contracts is recorded in accounts receivable rather than derivative assets in our consolidated balance sheets because these amounts are settled through our margin account with a third party broker 
net changes in premiums on options reflects the accounting for premiums on options purchased as an increase in the net derivative asset and premiums on options sold as a decrease in the net derivative asset 

table of contents contracts acquired represents the initial fair value of acquired derivative contracts recorded in derivative assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
other changes in fair value include transfers of derivative assets and liabilities between accounting methods resulting from the designation and de designation of cash flow hedges 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
for our financial assets and liabilities  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is the price that a market participant would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
consistent with the exit price concept  upon adoption we reduced our derivative liabilities to reflect our own credit risk 
as a result  during the first quarter of we recorded a pre tax reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss totaling million for the portion related to cash flow hedges and a pre tax gain in earnings totaling million for the remainder of our derivative liabilities 
all other impacts of adoption were immaterial 
we discuss sfas no 
and how we determine fair value in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the settlement terms of the portion of our net derivative asset subject to mark to market accounting and sources of fair value based on the fair value hierarchy established by sfas no 
are as follows as of december  settlement term thereafter fair value in millions level level level total net derivative asset liability subject to mark to market accounting management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts it holds and sells 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
additionally  because the depth and liquidity of the power markets varies substantially between regions and time periods  the prices used to determine fair value could be affected significantly by the volume of transactions executed 
future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and it is possible that such variations could be material 
we manage our mark to market risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of our contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract 
accordingly  we manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under our contracts in separate components based upon the commodity eg  electricity or gas  the product eg  electricity for delivery during peak or off peak hours  the delivery location eg  by region  the risk profile eg  forward or option  and the delivery period eg  by month and year 
the electricity  fuel  and other energy contracts we hold have varying terms to maturity  ranging from contracts for delivery the next hour to contracts with terms of ten years or more 
because an active  liquid electricity futures market comparable to that for other commodities has not developed  many contracts are direct contracts between market participants and are not exchange traded or financially settling contracts that can be readily offset in their entirety through an exchange or other market mechanism 
consequently  we and other market participants generally realize the value of these contracts as cash flows become due or payable under the terms of the contracts rather than through selling or liquidating the contracts themselves 
in order to realize the entire value of a long term contract in a single transaction  we would need to sell or assign the entire contract 
if we were to sell or assign any of our long term contracts in their entirety  we may not realize the entire value reflected in the preceding table 
however  based upon the nature of our global commodities operation  we expect to realize the value of these contracts  as well as any contracts we may enter into in the future to manage our risk  over time as the contracts and related hedges settle in accordance with their terms 
generally  we do not expect to realize the value of these contracts and related hedges by selling or assigning the contracts themselves in total 
operating expenses our merchant energy business operating expenses decreased million during compared to mostly due to lower performance based labor and benefit costs at our merchant energy business of million  partially offset by higher non labor operating expenses of million  which included approximately million of higher bad debt expense 
our merchant energy business operating expenses increased million during compared to mostly due to an increase at our global commodities and customer supply operations totaling million  primarily related to the continued growth of this operation and higher compensation and benefit costs

the percentage changes in our electric system distribution volumes  by type of customer  in and compared to the respective prior year were residential commercial industrial in  we distributed less electricity to residential and commercial customers due to milder weather and decreased usage per customer  partially offset by an increased number of customers 
we distributed less electricity to industrial customers primarily due to decreased usage per customer 
in  we distributed more electricity to residential customers due to colder winter weather and an increased number of customers  partially offset by decreased usage per customer 
we distributed more electricity to commercial customers due to increased usage per customer  colder winter weather  and an increased number of customers 
we distributed essentially the same amount of electricity to industrial customers 
maryland settlement credit as discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements  bge entered into a settlement agreement with the state of maryland and other parties  which provided residential electric customers a credit totaling per customer 
the estimated settlement of million was accrued in the second quarter of and a total of million was credited to customers in the third and fourth quarters of revenue decoupling beginning in  the maryland psc allows us to record a monthly adjustment to our electric distribution revenues from residential and small commercial customers to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on our electric distribution volumes 
this means our monthly electric distribution revenues for residential and small commercial customers are based on weather and usage that is considered normal for the month 
therefore  while these revenues are affected by customer growth  they will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions 
standard offer service bge provides standard offer service for customers that do not select an alternative supplier 
we discuss the provisions of maryland s senate bill related to residential electric rates in the business environment regulation maryland senate bills and section 
standard offer service revenues increased in compared to mostly due to higher standard offer service rates  partially offset by lower standard offer service volumes 
standard offer service revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to an increase in the standard offer service rates following the expiration of residential rate freeze service in july  partially offset by lower standard offer service volumes 
rate stabilization credits as a result of senate bill  we were required to defer from july  until may  a portion of the full market rate increase resulting from the expiration of the residential rate freeze 
in addition  we offered a plan also required under senate bill allowing residential customers the option to defer the transition to market rates from june  until january  revenues in increased compared to due to lower rate stabilization credits as a result of the expiration of the rate stabilization plans

we discuss the rate stabilization bonds in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
senate bill credits as a result of senate bill  beginning january   we were required to provide to residential electric customers a credit equal to the amount collected from all bge electric customers for the decommissioning of our calvert cliffs nuclear power plant and to suspend collection of the residential return component of the administrative charge collected through residential sos rates through may  under an order issued by the maryland psc in may  as of june   we were required to reinstate collection of the residential return component of the administration charge in rates and to provide all residential electric customers a credit for the residential return component of the administrative charge 
under the maryland settlement agreement  which is discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements  bge was allowed to resume collection of the residential return portion of the administrative charge from june  through may  without having to rebate it to residential customers 
the increase in revenues during compared to is primarily due to the absence of the credit for the residential return component of the administrative charge which was suspended under the maryland settlement agreement  partially offset by lower distribution volumes 
electricity purchased for resale expenses electricity purchased for resale expenses include the cost of electricity purchased for resale to our standard offer service customers 
these costs do not include the cost of electricity purchased by delivery service only customers

table of contents gas cost adjustments we charge our gas customers for the natural gas they purchase from us using gas cost adjustment clauses set by the maryland psc as described in note to consolidated financial statements 
however  under the market based rates mechanism approved by the maryland psc  our actual cost of gas is compared to a market index a measure of the market price of gas in a given period 
the difference between our actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers 
customers who do not purchase gas from bge are not subject to the gas cost adjustment clauses because we are not selling gas to them

fixed charges decreased million in compared to  mostly due to a lower average level of debt outstanding 
fixed charges at bge increased million in compared to mostly due to interest expense recognized on debt that was issued in october and the rate stabilization bonds issued in june income taxes our income tax expense decreased million during compared to mostly due to a decrease in income before income taxes  which included approximately billion of non tax deductible merger termination and strategic alternatives costs  partially offset by the absence of synthetic fuel tax credits  which expired in bge s income tax expense decreased million during compared to primarily due to lower pre tax income as a result of the million maryland settlement credit recorded in we discuss the maryland settlement agreement in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
our income taxes increased million in compared to mostly because of an increase in pre tax income and a decrease in synthetic fuel tax credits of million 
in  the state of maryland increased its corporate income tax rate from to  effective january  the impact of adjusting all existing deferred income tax assets and liabilities for this change in the period of enactment was not material to us 
however  this did impact bge  as discussed below

defined benefit plans expense and funded status our actual return on qualified pension plan assets for the purpose of computing annual net periodic pension cost in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions was a loss of during as compared to our assumption of an expected annual return on pension plan assets of 
this loss reflects the substantial declines in financial markets experienced through as disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements  we determine the expected return on pension plan assets component of our annual pension expense using a market related value of pension plan assets that recognizes asset gains and losses over a five year period 
as a result of the losses incurred during  our annual pension expense will increase beginning in also  the lower fair value of our pension plan assets increased our unfunded pension obligation at december  and the related after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 

in addition to the losses experienced on our pension plan assets during  there has also been a decrease in the discount rate we use to determine our defined benefit plan liabilities 
at december   our discount rate assumption decreased to from in the prior year as a result of a decrease in interest rates 
this will increase our pension and postretirement benefits expense beginning in and resulted in an increase in our unfunded obligation for those plans at december  we disclose the sfas no 
funded status adjustment at december   in note to consolidated financial 
table of contents statements 
in addition  effective january   we are reducing our expected annual return on pension plan assets from to based on updated analyses of projected future asset returns 
as a result of the losses experienced on our qualified pension plan assets during and the reductions to our expected annual return on pension plan assets and discount rate assumptions  we expect our annual defined benefit plans cost will be higher by approximately million pre tax  for the next five years 
in connection with the decline in our qualified pension plan funded status at december   we also expect to increase our annual qualified pension plan contributions from the million we contributed in to an average level of approximately million per year over the next five years 
these expectations about future cost and funding levels are subject to material revision based on numerous factors including actual pension asset returns  future interest rate levels  impact of available liquidity on amount and timing of contributions  potential changes in regulatory requirements  plan design amendments  and demographic experience 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable increased million from million at december  to million at december   related to our merchant energy business and regulated electric and gas businesses 
the increase in allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable from our merchant energy business was a result of counterparties with financial difficulties 
the regulated electric and gas allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable increased million in compared to  mostly due to increased customer bills caused by higher standard offer service rates and the decreased ability of customers to pay their utility bills as a result of the economic downturn 
if the current economic recession continues on a prolonged basis  our and bge s bad debt expense could increase in the future despite our efforts to mitigate those risks

the increase in restricted funds at our holding company and other is primarily related to billion of restricted cash related to the issuance of series b preferred stock to edf 
these funds are held at the holding company and are restricted for payment of the senior notes held by midamerican 
the senior notes were repaid in full in january certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year s presentation 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities cash used in operating activities was  million in compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in this  million decrease in cash flows was primarily due to an increase in net collateral and margin posted  payments to midamerican to terminate our planned merger  payments in connection with the conversion of the series a preferred stock  and credits rebated to bge residential electric customers

we discuss our netting of fair value collateral with our derivative assets liabilities in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the million increase in net collateral and margin posted during primarily reflects the following changes in commodity prices and the level of our open positions  increases in amounts posted to exchanges to meet initial margin requirements and changes in the rules governing exchange margin requirements  and additional collateral posted following our credit rating downgrades 
we discuss our security ratings in more detail below 
we discuss our downgrade collateral requirements in more detail in the collateral section 
we discuss all forms of collateral in terms of their impact on our net available liquidity in the available sources of funding section 
the remaining unfavorable change in cash used in operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the following million use of cash  consisting of million paid to midamerican related to the termination of the merger  million paid to midamerican for settling a portion of the conversion of the series a preferred stock in cash  and million paid to various parties for merger and other strategic alternatives costs  million of credits rebated to residential electric customers by bge as a result of the maryland settlement agreement  and million of additional interest paid 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this million favorable change was primarily due to an increase in non cash adjustments to net income and favorable changes in working capital  offset in part by unfavorable changes in net income 
non cash adjustments to net income increased million in compared to  primarily due to the absence of a million gain on sale of gas fired plants and discontinued operations in  a change in deferred fuel costs of million related mostly to lower deferrals of electricity purchased for resale under the bge rate stabilization plan  and a million increase in deferred income tax expense 
changes in working capital had a negative impact of million on cash flows from operations in compared to a negative impact of million in the improvement in working capital of million was mainly due to a million change in collateral related to changes in commodity prices and the level of our open positions  and a million favorable change in working capital related to our derivative positions  partially offset by a million unfavorable change in other components of working capital 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was  million in compared to  million in the million increase in cash used in compared to was primarily due to the increase in restricted cash of million  primarily relating to the billion proceeds received from the issuance of series b preferred stock to edf that is restricted to pay the senior notes 
the proceeds from the series b preferred stock issuance  as discussed in the cash flows from financing section below  are the source of the funds for the increase in restricted cash 
the senior notes were subsequently paid in january the increase in investments in property  plant and equipment of million 
this increase was primarily driven by environmental spending of million for our brandon shores coal fired generating plant and million in construction costs at our partially completed gas fired combined cycle power generating facility in alabama 
these increased uses of cash in investing activities are partially offset by the absence in of million of cash used in for contract and portfolio acquisitions  which we discuss in more detail below  and approximately million of higher proceeds received from sales of investments in compared to the proceeds in include million of cash received from edf that we will record as additional 
table of contents proceeds for edf s purchase of membership interest in our nuclear generation and operation business 
cash used in investing activities was  million in compared to cash provided by of million in the  million unfavorable change in compared to was primarily due to the following the absence of the net proceeds of  million from the sale of gas fired plants and discontinued operations received in  a million increase in contract and portfolio acquisitions that we discuss in more detail below  a million increase in investments in property  plant  and equipment primarily related to growth within our merchant segment  which includes spending related to environmental controls at our generating facilities  and a million increase in acquisitions  primarily related to our acquisitions of working interests in gas and oil producing properties and a retail competitive supply business as discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from financing activities cash provided by financing activities was  million in compared to million in the increase of  million was primarily due to the issuance of billion of mandatorily redeemable series b preferred stock to edf  the proceeds of which are reflected in the increase in restricted cash  as discussed in the cash flows from investing activities above  billion of mandatorily redeemable convertible series a preferred stock to midamerican  which was converted  in part  in december into billion of senior notes  which were repaid in full in january  million of zero coupon notes  million of series a junior subordinated debentures  and million of notes by bge 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the unfavorable change of million was primarily due to cash used for reacquisition of common stock of million  a net decrease in cash related to changes in short term borrowings and long term debt of million  and a net decrease of million in proceeds from the initial public offering of cep in this was partially offset by an increase in gross proceeds from contract and portfolio acquisitions of million  which we discuss below 
in october  our board of directors approved a common share repurchase program for up to billion of our outstanding common shares 
subsequent to this approval  on october   we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution  and on november  we purchased  of outstanding shares of our common stock for million 
we did not repurchase any shares under this program during we discuss the share repurchase program in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
contract and portfolio acquisitions during and  our merchant energy business acquired several pre existing energy purchase and sale agreements  which generated significant cash flows at the inception of the contracts 
these agreements had contract prices that differed from market prices at closing  which resulted in cash payments from the counterparty at the acquisition of the contract 
we received net cash of million in and million in for various contract and portfolio acquisitions 
we reflect the underlying contracts on a gross basis as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets depending on whether they were above or below market prices at closing  therefore  we have also reflected them on a gross basis in cash flows from investing and financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows as follows year ended december  in millions financing activities proceeds from contract and portfolio acquisitions investing activities contract and portfolio acquisitions cash flows from contract and portfolio acquisitions we record the proceeds we receive to acquire energy purchase and sale agreements as a financing cash inflow because it constitutes a prepayment for a portion of the market price of energy  which we will buy or sell over the term of the agreements and does not represent a cash inflow from current period operating activities 
for those acquired contracts that are derivatives  we record the ongoing cash flows related to the contract with the counterparties as financing cash inflows in accordance with sfas no 
for those acquired contracts that are not derivatives  we record the ongoing cash flows related to the contract as operating cash flows 
we discuss certain of these contract and portfolio acquisitions in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
security ratings independent credit rating agencies rate constellation energy s and bge s fixed income securities 
the ratings indicate the agencies assessment of each company s ability to pay interest  distributions  dividends  and principal on these securities 
these ratings affect how much it will cost each company to sell these securities and  in certain cases  the company s ability to access the markets to sell securities 
generally  the better the rating  the lower the cost of the securities to each company when they sell them 
a reduction in our credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our access to liquidity sources  increase our cost of funds  trigger additional collateral requirements  and or decrease 
table of contents the number of investors and counterparties willing to transact with us 
the factors that credit rating agencies consider in establishing constellation energy s and bge s credit ratings include  but are not limited to  cash flows  liquidity  business risk profile  stock price volatility  political  legislative and regulatory risk  interest charges relative to operating cash flow  and the level of debt relative to operating cash flows and to total capitalization

we discuss our available sources of funding in more detail below 
we discuss the potential effect of a ratings downgrade in the available source of funding and collateral sections 
available sources of funding in addition to cash generated from business operations  we rely upon access to capital for our capital expenditure programs and for the liquidity required to operate and support our commercial businesses 
our liquidity requirements are funded by credit facilities and cash 
we fund our short term working capital needs with existing cash and with our credit facilities  which support direct cash borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper 
we also use our credit facilities to support the issuance of letters of credit  primarily for our merchant energy business 
the primary drivers of our use of liquidity have been our capital expenditure requirements and collateral requirements associated with hedging our generating assets  hedging our customer supply business in both power and gas  and hedging our coal businesses 
significant changes in the prices of commodities  depending on hedging strategies we have employed  could require us to post additional letters of credit  and thereby reduce the overall amount available under our credit facilities or to post additional cash  and thereby reduce our available cash balance 
the current disruptions in the credit and capital markets have made it more difficult for us to raise capital and access the credit necessary to obtain sufficient liquidity to meet our business requirements 
constellation energy at december   we had approximately billion in committed credit facilities available as shown below

instead  we borrowed million under one of our credit facilities to secure funds 
at december   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
during the month of january  constellation energy issued no commercial paper 
we may utilize commercial paper as a primary source of short term debt if market conditions return to normal 
in connection with the investment agreement with edf  edf has provided us with up to billion pre tax  or approximately billion after tax  of additional liquidity pursuant to a put arrangement that will allow us to require edf to purchase certain non nuclear generation assets 
our ability to exercise the put arrangement is contingent on certain regulatory approvals that we expect will be received 
table of contents for all assets covered by the arrangement by april  except for safe harbor water power corporation  which is expected by the third quarter of in addition  exercise of the put option is conditioned upon third party consents  the absence of any material liens on such assets  and the absence of a material adverse effect  as defined in the investment agreement 
the put arrangement will expire at the earlier of december  or the termination of the investment agreement by edf in the event of a breach of contract by us 
certain credit facilities of constellation energy contain a provision requiring constellation energy to maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than 
at december   the debt to capitalization ratios as defined in the credit agreements were no greater than 
our billion credit facility requires us to maintain consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization to consolidated interest expense ratio of at least when our standard and poors senior unsecured debt rating is bbb or lower and our moody s senior unsecured debt rating is baa or lower 
the terms of the series b preferred stock allows us to issue debt without the consent of the holders of the majority of the series b preferred stock only if  after issuance of such debt  we maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than

we discuss our changes in collateral during in more detail in the collateral section 
we discuss the impact of the higher cash collateral posting in the financial condition cash flows section 

table of contents the change in credit facilities was due to the following executed a new agreement for billion in november executed an agreement with edf for credit support totaling million in december  which is discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements  executed an agreement for a total of million in june  of which million expires in and million expires in  and the expiration of a facility totaling million in december the following table provides our net available liquidity at january  as of january  constellation energy bge total consolidated in billions credit facilities less letters of credit issued less cash drawn on credit facilities undrawn facilities less commercial paper outstanding net available facilities add cash net available liquidity net available liquidity was unchanged at january  compared to december  however  we executed additional cash draws from our credit facilities of billion primarily due to working capital requirements for our power and natural gas settlements 
as a result of the significant events of  we have made substantial changes in our strategy to improve our liquidity and our credit profile  including focusing on the following immediate goals reducing the collateral and liquidity needs of our global commodities and customer supply operations  executing strategic initiatives for our global commodities operation  which we discuss in more detail in the merchant energy business background section  focusing on our core strengths  including owning  developing  and operating nuclear and non nuclear generation assets  providing regulated utility service to customers  and maintaining strong supply relationships with retail and wholesale customers  and working to close the sale of edf of of our nuclear generation and operation business as expeditiously as possible 
our liquidity needs vary as commodity prices change 
we regularly evaluate the effects of changing price levels on our liquidity needs by estimating the impacts of volatile power  gas  and coal prices on our price sensitive sources and uses of liquidity 
for example  energy contracts settling in the current year may impact our cash flows and changing price levels may impact our collateral requirements 
additionally  we consider the impact of other sources and uses of liquidity  including planned business divestitures  anticipated new business  capital expenditures  operating expenses and credit charges 
also  we are exposed to certain operational risks that could have a significant impact on our liquidity 
we discuss these risks in more detail in the risk factors section 
we believe that the actions that we have taken will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity requirements over the next months 
however  if we cannot successfully execute on our strategies and or actual changes in commodity prices differ from our estimates  our available liquidity would be negatively affected  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition 
collateral constellation energy s collateral requirements arise from its merchant energy business need to participate in certain organized markets  such as independent system operators isos or financial exchanges as well as from our goal of remaining economically hedged in our generation and power and gas customer supply operations  third party coal business  and our trading activities 
to support wholesale and retail power customer supply obligations  as well as some trading activities  constellation energy posts collateral to isos 
forward hedging of our generation and customer supply obligations  as well as our global commodities trading activities  creates the need to transact with exchanges such as new york mercantile exchange  intercontinental exchange  and nos clearing asa 
we post initial margin based on exchange rules  as well as variation margin related to the change in value of the net open position with the exchange 
constellation energy s initial margin requirements increased during the third quarter as a result of changes in exchange rules and decreased during the fourth quarter as a result of portfolio risk reduction and downsizing activities 
daily variation margin postings to each exchange depend on price moves in the underlying power  gas and coal exchange traded forward and option contracts 
in addition to the collateral posted to isos and exchanges  we post collateral with certain counterparties 
these collateral amounts may be fixed or may vary with price levels 
there are certain asymmetries relating to the use of collateral that create liquidity requirements for our merchant energy businesses 
these asymmetries arise as a result of our actions to be economically hedged as well as market conditions or conventions for conducting business that result in some transactions being collateralized while others are not  including in our third party coal business  we generally buy coal from suppliers that do not post collateral  but we enter into physical or financial sales contracts that require us to post collateral 
in our customer supply operation  we generally do not receive collateral under contractual obligations to supply power or gas to our customers but our global commodities operation hedges these transactions 
table of contents through purchases of power and gas that generally require us to post collateral 
in our generation operation  we may have to post collateral on our power sale or fuel purchase contracts  but our generating plants are not a source of collateral 
constellation energy is required to post collateral in the form of either cash or letters of credit 
in an environment of stable commodity prices  constellation energy s net collateral position is relatively stable 
however  during  the energy markets were affected by large fluctuations in commodity prices as can be seen in the following table summarizing changes in spot prices during increases decreases from december  six months ended june  nine months ended september  year ended december  power natural gas coal crude oil the price variability in impacted our posting of cash and letters of credit in as follows six months ended june  six months ended december  year ended december  in millions additional return of collateral held associated with nonderivative contracts additional collateral posted associated with nonderivative contracts additional return of initial and variation margin posted on exchange traded transactions recorded in accounts receivable additional return of fair value net cash collateral posted netted against derivative assets liabilities source use of cash collateral letters of credit issued by returned to us total use of collateral during the first half of  increasing power prices caused certain hedges of our customer supply load to move deeply in the money  driving up the cash collateral and letters of credit posted by counterparties to us 
however  letters of credit posted to us do not affect our liquidity position 
at the same time  rising international coal prices required us to post additional cash and letters of credit to collateralize out of the money hedges of our international coal sales 
these two impacts resulted in a net reduction in our use of cash collateral as we received more cash than we posted 
however  there was a significant increase in our posting of letters of credit 
during the second half of the year  our use of collateral postings remained fairly constant despite our fourth quarter portfolio downsizing 
portfolio downsizing led to decreases in the levels of collateral posted to exchanges to support initial margin requirements  as well as the collateral posted to isos 
however  as commodity prices have fallen  the hedges of our customer supply load moved out of the money  causing us to post significant amounts of cash collateral to our counterparties 
this collateral outflow for power positions was partially offset by the collateral inflow since june on our international coal hedges  which have become significantly less out of the money as coal prices have fallen 
the net impact of all of these price changes  as well as the portfolio downsizing has resulted in a net increase in our use of collateral of billion for we discuss our use of cash collateral further in the financial condition section and we discuss our letters of credit usage further in the net available liquidity section 
customers of our merchant energy business rely on the creditworthiness of constellation energy 
in this regard  we have certain agreements that contain provisions that would require us to post additional collateral upon a credit rating downgrade in the senior unsecured debt of constellation energy 
based on contractual provisions at december  and january   we estimate that if constellation energy s senior unsecured debt were downgraded to one level below the investment grade threshold we would have the following additional collateral obligations credit ratings downgraded to level below current rating additional obligations in billions below investment grade if there are split ratings among the independent credit rating agencies  the lowest credit rating is used to determine our incremental collateral obligations 
based on market conditions and contractual obligations at the time of a downgrade  we could be required to post additional collateral in an amount that could exceed the obligation amounts specified above  which could be material 
we discuss our credit ratings in the security ratings section 
we discuss our credit facilities in the available sources of funding section 

table of contents capital resources our actual consolidated capital requirements for the years through  along with the estimated annual amount for  are shown in the following table 
we will continue to have cash requirements for working capital needs  payments of interest  distributions  and dividends  capital expenditures  and the retirement of debt and redemption of preference stock 
capital requirements for and include estimates of spending for existing and anticipated projects 
we continuously review and modify those estimates 
actual requirements may vary from the estimates included in the table below because of a number of factors including regulation  legislation  and competition  bge load requirements  environmental protection standards  the type and number of projects selected for construction or acquisition  the effect of market conditions on those projects  the cost and availability of capital  the availability of cash from operations  and business decisions to invest in capital projects

this amount excludes the capital requirements related to our nuclear generation and operation business that is expected to be deconsolidated in as a result of the closing of the investment agreement with edf 
capital requirements merchant energy business our merchant energy business capital requirements consist of its continuing requirements  including expenditures for improvements to generating plants  nuclear fuel costs  costs of complying with the environmental protection agency epa  maryland  and pennsylvania environmental regulations and legislation  and enhancements to our information technology infrastructure 
regulated electric and gas regulated electric and gas construction expenditures primarily include new business construction needs and improvements to existing facilities  including projects to improve reliability and support demand response and conservation initiatives 
funding for capital requirements the current disruptions in the credit and capital markets as well as counterparty concerns about our financial condition have made it more difficult for us to raise capital and access the credit necessary to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our business requirements 
we discuss our available sources of funding and strategy to improve liquidity in the available sources of funding section 
merchant energy business we expect to fund the capital requirements of our merchant energy business with internally generated cash and other available sources 
to the extent that internally generated cash is not sufficient to meet those requirements  we would seek additional funding from the money markets  capital markets and lease markets  subject to credit conditions and market liquidity  and  if necessary  from drawdowns on credit facilities 
the projects that our merchant energy business develops typically require substantial capital investment 
many of the qualifying facilities and independent power projects that we have an interest in are financed primarily with non recourse debt that is repaid from the project s cash flows 
this debt is collateralized by interests in the physical assets  major project contracts and agreements  cash accounts and  in some cases  the ownership interest in that project 
regulated electric and gas we expect to fund capital expenditures associated with our regulated electric and gas businesses with internally generated cash 
to the extent that internally generated cash is not sufficient to meet those requirements  we would seek additional funding from the money markets  capital markets including trust preferred securities or preference stock  subject to credit conditions and market liquidity  and  if necessary  from drawdowns on credit facilities 
bge may also receive equity contributions from time to time from constellation energy 
bge also participates in a cash pool administered by constellation energy as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents other nonregulated businesses we expect to fund the capital requirements of our other nonregulated businesses with internally generated cash 
to the extent that internally generated cash is not sufficient to meet those requirements  we would seek additional funding from the money markets  capital markets and lease markets  subject to credit conditions and market liquidity  and  if necessary  from drawdowns on credit facilities 
we may also consider sales of securities and assets  and or from time to time equity contributions from constellation energy 
contractual payment obligations and committed amounts we enter into various agreements that result in contractual payment obligations in connection with our business activities 
these obligations primarily relate to our financing arrangements such as long term debt  preference stock  and operating leases  purchases of capacity and energy to support the growth in our merchant energy business activities  and purchases of fuel and transportation to satisfy the fuel requirements of our power generating facilities 
we detail our contractual payment obligations as of december  in the following table payments thereafter total in millions contractual payment obligations long term debt nonregulated principal interest total bge principal interest total bge preference stock operating leases purchase obligations purchased capacity and energy fuel and transportation other other noncurrent liabilities fin tax liability pension benefits postretirement and post employment benefits total contractual payment obligations amounts in long term debt reflect the original maturity date and include million of principal for the zero coupon senior notes  assuming the notes are not redeemed prior to june  and the original issue discount accrues until redemption 
investors may require us to repay million early through remarketing features 
interest on variable rate debt is included based on forward curve for interest rates 
our operating lease commitments include future payment obligations under certain power purchase agreements as discussed further in note to consolidated financial statements 
contracts to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms 
amounts related to certain purchase obligations are based on future purchase expectations which may differ from actual purchases 
our contractual obligations for purchased capacity and energy are shown on a gross basis for certain transactions  including both the fixed payment portions of tolling contracts and estimated variable payments under unit contingent power purchase agreements 
amounts related to pension benefits reflect our current year forecast for contributions for our qualified pension plans and participant payments for our nonqualified pension plans 
refer to note to consolidated financial statements for more detail on our pension plans 
amounts related to postretirement and postemployment benefits are for unfunded plans and reflect present value amounts consistent with the determination of the related liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements for financing and other business purposes  we utilize certain off balance sheet arrangements that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
such arrangements do not represent a significant part of our activities or a significant ongoing source of financing 
we use these arrangements when they enable us to obtain financing or execute commercial transactions on favorable terms 
as of december   we have no material off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees with third parties that are subject to the initial recognition and measurement requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  derivative instruments indexed to our common stock  and classified as equity  or variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support  or engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services 
at december   constellation energy had a total face amount of billion in guarantees outstanding  of which billion related to our merchant energy business 
these amounts generally do not represent incremental consolidated constellation energy obligations  rather  they primarily represent parental guarantees of certain subsidiary obligations to third parties in order to allow our subsidiaries the flexibility needed to conduct business with counterparties without having to post other forms of collateral 
our estimated net exposure for obligations under commercial transactions covered by these guarantees was approximately billion at december   which represents the total amount the parent company could be required to fund based on december  market prices 
for those guarantees related to our derivative liabilities  the fair value of the obligation is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe it is unlikely that we would be required to perform or incur any losses associated with guarantees of our subsidiaries obligations

table of contents risk management introduction constellation energy is exposed to market  credit  operational  and business risks that are fundamental to our business of providing products and services across the energy value chain 
in general  the risks in our businesses can be classified as one of the following market risk risk related to changes in energy commodity prices  load requirements  location and supply  and market rules  credit risk risk related to a customer s or supplier s inability to fulfill its contractual obligations due to financial distress  operational risk risk associated with human error or a failure of process and systems  or external factors  and business risk risk of unsuccessful business performance due to changing economic conditions  competition  regulatory environment  legislation  and economic conditions 
these risks exist in our business with varying levels of exposure  and are interrelated and cannot be managed in isolation 
each of the four risk classifications noted above can be affected by numerous internal and external forces  including economic conditions  market liquidity  competition  country or sovereign issues  systems or process failure  and fiscal and monetary policies 
as a result of the extent and diversity of the risks the company faces in its business operations  we analyze risk at transaction  portfolio  business  and enterprise wide levels to ensure that material risks are identified and managed effectively 
we utilize numerous methods to evaluate and measure risks 
in general  we evaluate risks in terms of the impact on our earnings  liquidity  strategic objectives  credit rating  reputation  and values 
we identify and evaluate risks based not only on their probability of occurring and magnitude of impact on the financial statements  but also with respect to the potential for significant or unexpected shifts in market conditions or rules 
we recognize the importance of managing risk as a key differentiator in the energy business and view the active and effective management of the risks in our businesses to be of paramount importance 
to foster a culture of risk awareness and management  we employ a risk management framework to identify  assess  monitor  manage  and report risks 
our risk management program is based on established policies and procedures to manage risks  combined with an extensive system of internal controls 
nevertheless  no system of risk management can cost effectively eliminate all risks to which an entity is exposed 
thus  in particular environments  the company may not be able to mitigate risk exposures to the level desired and may have exposures to certain risk factors that cannot be mitigated 
as previously discussed  the collapse of the credit markets and the extreme volatility in energy prices in significantly impacted constellation energy s operating results and financial condition 
we reviewed our risk management approach in light of the unprecedented market events of and their implications for the future  and we are updating and strengthening certain of our policies  measures  and processes 
we are taking active steps to incorporate the lessons learned in in our existing risk management and control frameworks as well as in the structure and processes of our risk management organization 
these steps include enhancing our collateral and liquidity stress testing capabilities as well as our data integrity reviews and systems capabilities and controls 
for example  we have continued our focus on value at risk var as a measure of market risk and supplemented this measure with economic value at risk evar 
we have also continued our practice of utilizing stress tests and broader position limits based on market liquidity and have enhanced these capabilities throughout in this section  we will review the company s risk in terms of our risk governance  risk controls  and risk exposures 
risk governance as has been our practice  the audit committee of the board of directors periodically reviews compliance with our risk parameters  limits  and trading guidelines  and our board of directors has established a var limit 
as discussed below  we have a risk management group rmg that is responsible for monitoring the key business risks  enforcing compliance with risk management policies and risk limits  as well as managing credit risk 
the rmg reports to the chief risk officer  who provides regular risk management updates to the audit committee and the board of directors 
we also have a risk management committee rmc that is responsible for establishing risk management policies  reviewing procedures for the identification  assessment  measurement  and management of risks  and monitoring and reporting risk exposures 
the rmc meets on a regular basis and is chaired by our chief risk officer  and consists of our chief executive officer  our chief financial officer  our vice chairman  and business unit leaders 
in addition  the chief risk officer coordinates with the risk management committees at the business units that meet regularly to identify  assess  and quantify material risk issues and to develop strategies to manage these risks 
in an effort to manage market and credit risks  constellation energy has established a series of limits that reflect the company s risk tolerances in the context of the market environment and our business strategy 
in setting limits  the company takes into consideration factors such as market volatility  product liquidity  business trends  and management experience 
the company maintains different limits at the corporate and business unit levels 
business units are responsible for adhering to established limits  against which exposures are monitored and reported 
limit breaches are reported in a timely manner to senior management  who consults with the business 
table of contents unit on an appropriate course of action for instance  reducing trading positions 
risk controls risk controls are applied at the level of individual exposures and portfolios of exposures in each business and to risk in aggregate  across all businesses and major risk types  relative to the company s risk capacity 
constellation energy s rmg is an independent function tasked with providing an independent quantification and assessment of key business risks  as well as providing an evaluation of individual risk components that contribute to the company s consolidated risk profile 
the rmg is also responsible for establishing risk policies  maintaining appropriate risk controls  ensuring compliance with policies and procedures  and monitoring methods according to the risk parameters established by the board of directors 
the rmg consists of five divisions that focus on a specialized area of risk 
wholesale and retail credit risk management wholesale credit risk management establishes guidelines necessary for rating counterparties and assigning limits 
this group supports the business units by establishing credit relationships with various counterparties and facilitating market liquidity with limits and appropriate credit terms and conditions 
the retail credit risk management group works as a partner with our retail customer facing operations to manage credit risks associated with our retail supply businesses 
this group evaluates credit and manages overall credit exposure for the retail operation 
credit risk managers are responsible for enforcing credit policies  including monitoring  reporting  escalating  and mitigating trade violations and limit exceptions 
market risk management market risk management is responsible for effectively identifying  monitoring  and reporting on market risk  to include price volatility  market liquidity  and portfolio risk management 
their key responsibilities are to identify market risk exposures including commodity  interest rate  and foreign exchange risk  and to monitor both physical and financial portfolio positions 
this group also enforces the market risk policies and ensures compliance with these policies  including the monitoring  analyzing  and escalating of market risk controls  such as exposure limits and price verification results 
collateral risk management collateral risk management is responsible for providing an integrated view on credit  market  and company liquidity risks to manage the company s collateral position 
this group s responsibilities include measuring and monitoring collateral outflow  downgrade collateral needs  and collateral use across the company 
additionally  this group estimates potential collateral requirements due to market shifts  hedging strategies  and adjustments to the company s credit ratings 
finally  collateral risk management assists the businesses in determining the strategic use of collateral and the appropriate cost of collateral for transactions 
operational risk management each business area maintains responsibility for operational risk management 
a corporate staff oversees implementation of a common framework for defining  measuring  monitoring  and reporting operational risks 
risk infrastructure risk infrastructure supports the risk management divisions and consolidates risk exposures across the businesses and disciplines 
this group s responsibilities include risk and credit systems design and maintenance  risk metric development and calculation  controls structure and enforcement  and risk reporting 
in addition  the risk infrastructure group provides analytical support to the risk functions  validates company models  and verifies liquid and illiquid forward price curves and volatilities 
finally  this group performs independent risk assessments  due diligence  and risk adjusted valuations of transactions  mergers and acquisitions  and large capital projects 
risk exposures we manage risks across our merchant energy  regulated electric  and regulated gas businesses 
we summarize below the risks we manage within each of our businesses 
merchant energy business our merchant energy business is exposed to various risks in the competitive marketplace that may materially impact our financial results and affect our earnings 
these risks include changes in commodity prices  potential imbalances in supply and demand  credit risk and operational risk 
regulated electric business bge does not own or operate any electric generating facilities 
therefore  bge s regulated electric business is exposed to market price risk 
to mitigate this  bge obtains energy and capacity to provide sos through a competitive bidding process approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss sos and the impact on base rates in more detail in item business baltimore gas and electric company electric business section 
as a result of this process  bge s exposure to market price risk is limited  and at december   our exposure to commodity price risk for our regulated electric business was not material 
however  bge may enter into electric futures  options  and swaps to hedge its market price risk if appropriate 
we discuss this further in note bge s regulated electric business is also exposed to wholesale credit risk from its suppliers as well as retail credit risk from its customers 
finally  bge is subject to operational risks  including potential impacts from storms and distribution asset failures 

table of contents regulated gas business bge acquires all of its natural gas for delivery to customers from third party suppliers 
therefore  bge s regulated gas business is exposed to market price risk 
however  bge recovers the costs of purchased gas under the market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
additionally  bge may enter into gas futures  options  and swaps to hedge its price risk under our market based rate incentive mechanism and our off system gas sales program as appropriate 
we discuss this further in note at december   our exposure to commodity price risk for our regulated gas business was not material 
bge s regulated gas business is also exposed to wholesale credit risk from its suppliers as well as retail credit risk from its customers 
finally  bge is subject to operational risks  including potential impacts from storms and distribution asset failures 
risk exposure categories the various categories of risk exposures that we manage include  but are not limited to  market risk  which includes interest rate risk  security price risk  and foreign currency risk  credit risk  which includes wholesale and retail  and operational risk 
as noted above  these risks may be common to more than one of our businesses 
we discuss each of these primary risk exposure categories separately below 
market risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of power  natural gas  coal  and other commodities 
these risks arise from our ownership and operation of power plants  our customer supply operations  and our origination  risk management  and trading activities 
these commodity price risks arise from the potential for changes in the price of  and transportation costs for  electricity  natural gas  coal  and other commodities  and changes in interest rates 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the energy markets influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products 
we use such commodities and products in our merchant energy business  and if we do not hedge the associated financial exposure  this commodity price volatility could affect our earnings 
these factors include seasonal  daily  and hourly changes in demand  extreme peak demands due to weather conditions  available supply resources  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving obligations  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical power system during extreme conditions  changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations  and geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of coal  oil  and natural gas 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the world as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical power and gas systems  and the nature and extent of power market restructuring 
additionally  we have fuel requirements that are subject to future changes in coal  natural gas  uranium  and oil prices 
our power generation facilities purchase fuel under contracts or in the spot market 
fuel prices may be volatile  and the price that can be obtained from electricity sales may not change at the same rate or in the same direction as changes in fuel costs 
this could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
as part of our overall portfolio  we manage the market risk of our merchant energy business  including electricity sales  fuel and energy purchases  emission credits  interest rate and foreign currency risks  weather risk  and the market risk of outages 
in order to manage these risks  we may enter into fixed price derivative or non derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of energy  including forward contracts  which commit us to purchase or sell energy commodities in the future  futures contracts  which are exchange traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument  or to make a cash settlement  at a specific price and future date  swap agreements  which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual notional quantity  and option contracts  which convey the right to buy or sell a commodity  financial instrument  or index at a predetermined price 
the objectives for entering into such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on our electric generation operations  fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of our power plants  fixing the price for a portion of anticipated energy purchases to supply our load serving customers  managing our collateral requirements  and managing our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risks 
the portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management s assessment of market  weather  operational  and other factors 
while some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we use our 
table of contents best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold and sell 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
however  it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording derivative assets and liabilities subject to mark to market accounting  and such variations could be material 
power  gas  coal  and other commodity trading risks involve the potential decline in net income or financial condition due to adverse changes in market prices  whether arising from customer activities or proprietary positions taken by the company 
price risk is monitored using var and evar 
var we measure the sensitivity of our mark to market energy contracts of our global commodities operation to potential changes in market prices using var 
var is a statistical model designed to predict risk of loss based on historical market price volatility 
we calculate var using a historical variance covariance technique that models option positions using a linear approximation of their value 
additionally  we estimate variances and correlation using historical commodity price changes over the most recent rolling three month period 
our var calculation includes all of our global commodities operation derivative assets and liabilities subject to mark to market accounting  including contracts for energy commodities and derivatives that result in physical settlement and contracts that require cash settlement 
the var calculation does not include market risks associated with activities that are subject to accrual accounting  primarily our generating facilities and our customer supply load serving activities 
the var amounts below represent the potential pre tax loss in the fair value of our global commodities operation derivative assets and liabilities subject to mark to market accounting  including both trading and non trading activities  over one and ten day holding periods 
total wholesale var for the year ended december  in millions confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low confidence level  ten day holding period year end average high low the mark to market var during november and december was adjusted to eliminate the impact of a change in accounting treatment of coal positions that are expected to be part of the planned sale of our international commodities operation 
we experienced higher average var for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a higher number of economic hedges of accrual positions  increased volatility of commodity market prices  and an increase in our trading activities discussed below 
we discuss our mark to market results in more detail in the global commodities section 
the following table details our var for the trading portion of our wholesale marketing and risk management derivative assets and liabilities subject to mark to market accounting over a one day holding period at a confidence level for and wholesale trading var for the year ended december  in millions average high trading var was higher during as compared to due to increased price volatility and greater amount of risk the global commodities operation group managed during the year 
our trading positions can be used to manage the commodity price risk of our customer supply activities and our generation facilities 
we also engage in proprietary trading activities  though  as previously discussed  the company is pursuing a new business strategy and proprietary trading will be sharply curtailed going forward 
trading activities are managed through daily var and stop loss limits and liquidity guidelines 

table of contents due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as var and the seasonality of changes in market prices  the var calculation may not reflect the full extent of our commodity price risk exposure 
additionally  because our var methodology uses a linear approximation method  actual changes in the value of options in our portfolio resulting from significant price changes may differ from estimates generated using this methodology 
as a result  actual changes in the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities subject to mark to market accounting could differ from the calculated var  and such changes could have a material impact on our financial results 
while var reflects the risk of loss under normal market conditions  stress testing captures the company s exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets 
we regularly conduct economic value stress tests for our market activities using multiple scenarios that assume stressed changes in both price level and spreads 
additional scenarios focus on the risks predominant in individual portions of our business segments and include scenarios that focus on loss of generation  customer demand growth or demand destruction  or a shift in the composition of load serving customers 
along with var  stress testing is important in measuring and controlling risk 
stress testing enhances the understanding of the company s risk profile and loss potential  and stress losses are monitored against limits 
we also use stress testing in approvals of non standard transactions and for cross business risk measurement  as well as an input to economic capital allocation 
stress test results  trends  and explanations are provided each month to the company s senior management and to the lines of business to help them better measure and manage risks and to understand event risk sensitive positions 
evar where var is a measure of risk for our mark to market portfolios  evar is a measure that attempts to estimate the sensitivity of our total portfolio economic value to changes in market prices 
the evar measure includes all positions of our merchant business  including generation  customer supply  and global commodities operations 
each business day  the company undertakes evar calculations that include both its trading and its non trading risks 
evar for non trading positions measures the amount of potential change in the fair values of the exposures related to accrual exposures 
evar is a one day measure calculated at a confidence level using a year time horizon 
at december   our evar was approximately million  which represents a decline from its level of million in mid september  when we started reducing the risk of our global commodities portfolio 
at january   evar has declined further to approximately million 
evar is a statistical risk measurement model subject to limitations similar to those of var 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of financing through our issuance of variable rate and fixed rate debt and certain related interest rate swaps 
we may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
in july  to optimize the mix of fixed and floating rate debt  we entered into interest rate swaps relating to million of our long term debt 
these fair value hedges effectively convert our current fixed rate debt to a floating rate instrument tied to the three month london inter bank offered rate 
including the million in interest rate swaps  approximately of our long term debt is floating rate 
we discuss our use of derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the following table provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to interest rate changes principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity date thereafter total fair value at december  dollars in millions long term debt variable rate debt average interest rate a fixed rate debt b  c  average interest rate a interest on variable rate debt is included based on the forward curve for interest rates at december  b fixed rate debt includes million of principal for the zero coupon senior notes  assuming the notes are not redeemed prior to june  and the original issue discount accrues until redemption 
c amount excludes million of long term debt that is periodically remarketed and could require us to repay the debt prior to maturity of which million is classified as current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets and in note to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents security price risk we are exposed to price fluctuations in financial markets primarily through our pension plan assets  our nuclear decommissioning trust funds  and trust assets securing certain executive benefits 
we are required by the nrc to maintain externally funded trusts for the costs of decommissioning our nuclear power plants 
we discuss our nuclear decommissioning trust funds in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
a hypothetical decrease in security prices  excluding our pension plan assets  would result in an approximate million reduction in the fair value of our financial investments that are classified as available for sale securities  excluding cash 
in  our actual loss on pension plan assets was million due to significant declines in the markets in which plan assets are invested 
we describe our funding requirements in more detail in the defined benefits plans and funded status section 
we describe our financial investments in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements  and our pension plans in note to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk our merchant energy business is exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
this foreign currency risk arises from our activities in countries where we transact in currencies other than the us dollar 
in  our exposure to foreign currency risk was not material 
we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk using a comprehensive foreign currency hedging program 
while we cannot predict currency fluctuations  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate risk could be material  although we expect it will be minimal with respect to the euro dollar or british pound as we divest our international commodities operation 
we will continue to have limited exposure to the canadian dollar due to our gas and power operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk through our merchant energy business and bge s operations 
credit risk is the loss that may result from counterparties nonperformance and retail collections 
we evaluate the credit risk of our global commodities operation and our retail activities separately as discussed below 
wholesale credit risk we measure wholesale credit risk as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative transactions both mark to market and accrual adjusted for amounts owed to or due from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses  where we have a legally enforceable right of setoff 
we monitor and manage the credit risk of our global commodities operation through credit policies and procedures  which include an established credit approval process  daily monitoring of counterparty credit limits  the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin  collateral  or prepayment arrangements  and the use of master netting agreements 
as of december  and  counterparties in the credit portfolio of our global commodities operation had the following public credit ratings at december  rating investment grade non investment grade not rated includes counterparties with an investment grade rating by at least one of the major credit rating agencies 
if split rating exists  the lower rating is used 
our exposure to not rated counterparties was billion at december  compared to billion at december  this decrease was mostly due to a decrease in our portfolio s credit exposure to natural gas customers  international coal customers  and freight companies that do not have public credit ratings 
although not publicly rated  many of these counterparties are considered investment grade equivalent based on our internal credit ratings 
we utilize internal credit ratings to evaluate the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers  including those companies that do not have public credit ratings 
based on internal credit ratings  approximately million or of the exposure to unrated counterparties was rated investment grade equivalent at december  and approximately million or was rated investment grade equivalent at december  the following table provides the breakdown of the credit quality of our wholesale credit portfolio based on our internal credit ratings 
at december  investment grade equivalent non investment grade equivalent our total exposure  net of collateral  to counterparties across our entire wholesale portfolio is billion as of december  the top ten counterparties account for approximately of our total exposure 
as shown in the table below  no single counterparty concentration comprises more than of the total exposure of the portfolio 
if a counterparty were to default on its contractual obligations and we were to liquidate transactions with that entity  our potential credit loss would include all forward and settlement exposure plus any additional costs related to termination and replacement of the positions 
this would include contracts accounted for using the mark to market  hedge  and accrual accounting methods  the amount owed or due from settled transactions  less any collateral held from the counterparty 
in addition  if a counterparty were to default under an accrual contract that is currently favorable to us  we may recognize a material adverse impact on our results in the future delivery period to the extent that we are required to replace the contract that is in default with another contract at current market prices 
to reduce our credit risk with 
table of contents counterparties  we attempt to enter into agreements that allow us to obtain collateral on a contingent basis  seek third party guarantees of the counterparty s obligation  and enter into netting agreements that allow us to offset receivables and payables with forward exposure across many transactions 
our total exposure of billion  net of collateral  includes accrual positions and derivatives 
the portion of our wholesale credit risk related to transactions that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets  net of collateral  totals approximately billion and primarily relates to open energy commodity positions from our global commodities operation that are accounted for using mark to market accounting  derivatives that qualify for designation as hedges under sfas no 
 as well as amounts owed by wholesale counterparties for transactions that settled but have not yet been paid 
the following table highlights the credit quality and exposures related to these activities at december  rating total exposure before credit collateral credit collateral net exposure number of counterparties greater than of net exposure net exposure of counterparties greater than of net exposure dollars in millions investment grade split rating non investment grade internally rated investment grade internally rated non investment grade total due to volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the power our global commodities operation had contracted for  we could incur a loss that could have a material impact on our financial results 
if a counterparty were to default and we were to liquidate all contracts with that entity  our credit loss would include the loss in value of derivative contracts recorded at fair value  the amount owed for settled transactions  and additional payments  if any  that we would have to make to settle unrealized losses on accrual contracts 
in addition  if a counterparty were to default under an accrual contract that is currently favorable to us  we may recognize a material adverse impact in our results in the future delivery period to the extent that we are required to replace the contract that is in default with another contract at current market prices 
these potential losses would be limited to the extent that the in the money amount exceeded any credit mitigants such as cash  letters of credit  or parental guarantees supporting the counterparty obligation 
we also enter into various wholesale transactions through isos 
these isos are exposed to counterparty credit risks 
any losses relating to counterparty defaults impacting the isos are allocated to and borne by all other market participants in the iso 
these isos have established credit policies and practices to mitigate the exposure of counterparty credit risks 
as a market participant  we continuously assess our exposure to the credit risks of each iso 
bge is exposed to wholesale credit risk of its suppliers for electricity and gas to serve its retail customers 
bge may receive performance assurance collateral to mitigate electricity suppliers credit risks in certain circumstances 
performance assurance collateral is designed to protect bge s potential exposure over the term of the supply contracts and will fluctuate to reflect changes in market prices 
in addition to the collateral provisions  there are supplier step up provisions  where other suppliers can step in if the early termination of a full requirements service agreement with a supplier should occur  as well as specific mechanisms for bge to otherwise replace defaulted supplier contracts 
all costs incurred by bge to replace the supply contract are to be recovered from the defaulting supplier or from customers through rates 
retail credit risk we are exposed to retail credit risk through our competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities  which serve commercial and industrial companies  and through bge s electricity and natural gas distribution operations 
retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations or fail to pay for service rendered 
this risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances  as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve customers of our nonregulated retail businesses 
retail credit risk is managed through established credit approval policies  monitoring customer exposures  and the use of credit mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements 
in addition  we have taken steps to augment our credit staff in response to current economic conditions 
retail credit quality is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes 
if the business environment were to be negatively affected by changes in economic or other market conditions  our retail credit risk may be adversely impacted 
our retail credit portfolio is diversified with no significant company or industry concentrations 
in  reserve levels have been increased across our retail businesses due to indicators of deteriorating credit quality and macroeconomic slowdown 
bge is subject to retail credit risk associated with both the delivery portion of a customer s bill as well as on the uncollectible expense or credit risk from the gas and or electric commodity portion of the bills of those customers to whom bge sells the gas and electric commodity 
although both bge s delivery and commodity rates include some level of costs for uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses  full recovery is not guaranteed and bge is exposed to these potential losses and related carrying costs 

table of contents operational risk operational risk is the risk associated with human error or a failure of our processes and systems  or external factors 
we are exposed to many types of operational risks  including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders  clerical and record keeping errors  and computer systems malfunctions 
in addition  we may also be subject to disruptions in our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  such as natural disasters  acts of terrorism  and computer viruses  which may give rise to losses in service to customers and or monetary losses to us 
we own and operate a number of power generation facilities  which utilize a diverse mix of fuel sources to include coal  gas  oil  hydro  biomass  and nuclear 
we are exposed to risk resulting from generating plants not being available to produce energy and the risks related to physical delivery of energy to meet our customers needs 
if one or more of our generating facilities is not able to produce electricity when required due to operational factors  we may have to forego sales opportunities or fulfill fixed price sales commitments through the operation of other more costly generating facilities or through the purchase of energy in the wholesale market at higher prices 
we purchase electricity from generating facilities we do not own 
if one or more of those generating facilities were unable to produce electricity due to operational factors  we may be forced to purchase electricity in the wholesale market at higher prices 
this could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our nuclear plants produce electricity at a relatively low marginal cost 
the nine mile point facility and the ginna facility sell of their respective output under unit contingent power purchase agreements we have no obligation to provide power if the units are not available to the previous owners 
however  if an unplanned outage were to occur at calvert cliffs during periods when demand was high  we may have to purchase replacement power at potentially higher prices to meet our obligations  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we are exposed to the risk that available sources of supply may differ from the amount of power demanded by our customers under fixed price load serving contracts 
during periods of high demand  our power supplies may be insufficient to serve our customers needs and could require us to purchase additional energy at higher prices 
alternatively  during periods of low demand  our electricity supplies may exceed our customers needs and could result in us selling that excess energy at lower prices 
either of those circumstances could have a negative impact on our financial results 
we are also exposed to variations in the prices and required volumes of natural gas  oil  and coal we burn at our power plants to generate electricity 
therefore  high commodity prices increase the impact of generator outages and variable load  but as long as the electricity and fuel prices move in tandem  we have limited exposure to changing commodity prices 
during periods of high demand on our generation assets  our fuel supplies may be insufficient and could require us to procure additional fuel at higher prices 
alternatively  during periods of low demand on our generation assets  our fuel supplies may exceed our needs  and could result in us selling the excess fuels at lower prices 
either of these circumstances will have a negative impact on our financial results
