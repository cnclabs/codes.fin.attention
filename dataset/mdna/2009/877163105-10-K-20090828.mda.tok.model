statements accompanied or qualified by  or containing  words such as may  will  should  believes  expects  intends  plans  projects  estimates  predicts  potential  outlook  forecast  anticipates  presume  assume and optimistic constitute forward looking statements and  as such  are not a guarantee of future performance 
the statements involve factors  risks and uncertainties  the impact or occurrence of which can cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in such statements 
risks and uncertainties can include  among others  fluctuations in general business cycles and changing economic conditions  changing product demand and industry capacity  increased competition and pricing pressures  advances in technology that can reduce the demand for the company s products  as well as other factors  many or all of which may be beyond the company s control 
consequently  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as predictive of future results 
the company disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to the forward looking statements herein to reflect any change in the company s expectations with regard thereto  or any changes in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are affected by management s application of accounting policies  which are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as discussed below  our financial position or results of operations may be materially affected when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
accounts receivable our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
accounts receivable are stated at an amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances 
management provides for probable uncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts after considering the age of each receivable and communications with the customers involved 
balances that are collected  for which a credit to a valuation allowance had previously been recorded  result in a current period reversal of the earlier transaction charging earnings and crediting a valuation allowance 
balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable in the current period 
historically  management s estimates have been conservative  thus increasing the valuation allowance while collection efforts continue 
the actual amount of accounts written off over the five year period ended may  equaled only of sales for that period 
while subsequent collection of amounts previously reserved has resulted in a reduction of the valuation allowance  the amounts have not been material 
the balance of the valuation allowance decreased by  since may  to the current level of  management does not expect the valuation allowance to materially change in the future for the current accounts receivable balance 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of average cost or market 
average cost approximates first in  first out cost 
maintenance and other inventory represent stock that is estimated to have a product life cycle in excess of twelve months 
this stock represents certain items the company is required to maintain for service of products sold  and items that are generally subject to spontaneous ordering 
this inventory is particularly sensitive to technical obsolescence in the near term due to its use in industries characterized by the continuous introduction of new product lines  rapid technological advances and product obsolescence 
therefore  management of the company has recorded an allowance for potential inventory obsolescence 
based on certain assumptions and judgments made from the information available at that time  we determine the amount in the inventory allowance 
if these estimates and related assumptions or the market changes  we may be required to record additional reserves 
historically  actual results have not varied materially from the company s estimates 
the provision for potential inventory obsolescence was  and  for the years ended may  and revenue recognition sales are recognized when units are delivered or services are performed 
sales under fixed price contracts are recorded as deliveries are made at the contract sales price of the units delivered 
sales under certain fixed price contracts requiring substantial performance over several periods prior to commencement of deliveries  are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting whereby revenues are recognized based on estimates of completion prepared on a ratio of cost to total estimated cost basis 
costs include all material and direct and indirect charges related to specific contracts 
other expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
total estimated costs for each of the contracts are estimated based on a combination of historical costs of manufacturing similar products and estimates or quotes from vendors for supplying parts or services towards the completion of the manufacturing process 
adjustments to cost and profit estimates are made periodically due to changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements 
these changes may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
any losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined 
if total costs calculated upon completion of the manufacturing process in the current period for a contract are more than the estimated total costs at completion used to calculate revenue in a prior period  then the revenue and profits in the current period will be lower than if the estimated costs used in the prior period calculation were equal to the actual total costs upon completion 
historically  actual results have not varied materially from the company s estimates 
in the fiscal year ended may   of total revenue recognized was accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting while the remaining of revenue was recorded as deliveries were made to our customers 
in the fiscal year ended may   of total revenue recognized was accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting while the remaining of revenue was recorded as deliveries were made to our customers 
for financial statement presentation purposes  the company nets progress billings against the total costs incurred on uncompleted contracts 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
income taxes the provision for income taxes provides for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements regardless of when such taxes are payable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets relate principally to asset valuation allowances such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves and also to liabilities including warranty reserves  accrued vacation  accrued commissions and others 
the deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to differences between financial statement and tax depreciation 
deferred taxes are based on tax laws currently enacted with tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income at the time temporary differences become deductible 
the company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that deferred tax assets may not be realized 
a valuation allowance has not been recorded against the deferred tax assets since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are recoverable 
the company considers future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a potential valuation allowance 
in future years the company will need to generate approximately million of taxable income in order to realize our deferred tax assets recorded as of may  of  this deferred tax asset balance is  higher than at the end of the prior year primarily due to an increase in the difference between the book and tax inventory values 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
if actual results differ from estimated results or if the company adjusts these assumptions  the company may need to adjust its deferred tax assets or liabilities  which could impact its effective tax rate 
historically  actual results have not varied materially from the company s estimates 
the company and its subsidiary file separate federal and state income tax returns

as a percentage of net revenues the company s consolidated results of operations showed a decrease in net revenues and a decrease in net income of 
gross profit decreased by 
the net revenue  gross profit and net income levels reached for the year ended may  were record highs for the company 
revenues recorded in the current period for long term construction projects decreased by from the level recorded in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to fewer projects completed in the current year in fiscal  in fiscal as well as smaller sales value for the projects completed 
the average total order value of completed projects in fiscal was  down from  in fiscal revenues recorded for all other product sales decreased by from last year 
the gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the current and prior year periods was and  respectively 
sales of the company s products are made to three general groups of customers industrial  construction and aerospace defense 
a breakdown of sales to these three general groups of customers is as follows industrial industrial construction construction aerospace defense aerospace defense management attributes a large portion of the decrease in revenue to the current economic recession and its effect on the construction markets throughout the world 
several construction projects in the united states and in asia that had been in the planning stages during the past year or more have been placed on hold by their owners  citing the decline in demand for their buildings or an inability to secure the necessary financing to complete their projects 
we maintain contact with these owners contractors so that we will be in a position to work with them should their project resume activity 
it is not possible to determine the amount of contracts which we may have been awarded had the construction projects not been placed on hold 
a small number of customers have cancelled outstanding purchase orders with the company 
we include provisions in our contracts for the building projects that allow us to collect from the customer a pro rata amount for work completed on a contract at the time of cancellation 
these cancelled purchase orders are not expected to have a material impact on our operating results or cash flow 
at may   we had open sales orders in our backlog with a total sales value of million 
at may   we had fewer open sales orders in our backlog orders but the total sales value is million or approximately higher than the prior year 
million of the current backlog is on projects already in progress 
million of the million sales order backlog at may  was in progress at that date 
in order to remain profitable during this down turn in the economy  we are carefully watching our expenses to reduce them wherever possible 
management is cautiously optimistic that the year end sales order backlog will provide a strong start towards positive revenue growth and operating results for fiscal compared with fiscal of the sales value in the backlog is for aerospace defense customers compared to at the end of fiscal the company continues to be negatively affected by the slow global construction market 
as a percentage of the total sales order backlog  orders from customers in construction accounted for at may  and at may  the company s revenues and net income fluctuate from period to period 
the increases in the current period  compared to the prior period  are not necessarily representative of future results 
net revenue by geographic region  as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal years ended may  and is as follows north america north america asia asia other other selling  general and administrative expenses year ended change may  may  increase decrease percent change outside commissions other sg a total sg a 
as a percentage of net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by from the prior year 
outside commission expense decreased by over last year s level 
outside commission expense was lower in this period due to a lower level of sales 
other selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by from last year 
the above factors resulted in operating income of  for the year ended may   down from the  in the prior year 
interest expense of  is less than in the prior year 
the average level of use of the company s operating line of credit remained fairly constant from last year to this year at million 
the interest rate on the operating line of credit decreased percentage points since may  to at may  
the line of credit is used primarily to fund the production of larger projects that do not allow for advance payments or progress payments 
the company s effective tax rate etr is calculated based upon current assumptions relating to the year s operating results and various tax related items 
the etr for the fiscal year ended may  is  almost identical to the etr for the prior year of 
a reconciliation of provision for income taxes at the statutory rate to income tax provision at the company s effective rate is as follows computed tax provision at the expected statutory rate effect of graduated federal rates on subsidiary income state income tax net of federal tax benefit tax effect of permanent differences equity in net income of affiliate minority shareholder interest extraordinary gain upon merger other permanent differences other merger with tayco developments as noted in item above  the company merged with developments effective april  in the merger  each outstanding share of developments common stock was converted into the right to receive one share of taylor devices  inc common stock 
the paid in capital of the company was increased for most of the value of the new shares of company stock exchanged for shares of developments stock 
this was offset considerably by the cancellation of the shares of the company s stock that had been owned by developments 
the net increase in paid in capital for this transaction was  the per share value of was calculated as the average of the closing bid and ask prices on march  this same amount was used to value the company s shares of stock that were received as treasury stock in exchange for each share of developments stock that was owned by the company 
a summary of the company s common stock changes due to the merger follows shares of common common paid in treasury stock stock capital stock shares exchanged for developments shares shares cancelled that were owned by developments  shares received as treasury shares for each share of developments owned by the company net change    a significant change in the company s consolidated statement of income from last year to this year is the recording of an extraordinary gain that resulted from the merger 
the  gain was calculated as the amount by which the value of the net assets acquired with developments exceeded the total acquisition costs 
the equity in net income of affiliate and minority stockholder s interest lines on the consolidated statement of income were zero in the current year because the transaction occurred last year 
the amounts reported on these lines for the prior year are not significantly different from a full year because the transaction occurred after ten months of the year were completed 
consolidated statement of income items equity in net income of affiliate minority stockholder s interest extraordinary gain on the merger following the merger  the independent existence of developments ended and realty became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the chart below shows the company s equity interest in the affiliated companies prior to the merger and subsequent to the merger before merger after merger tayco developments  inc prior to becoming part of the company tayco realty  inc stock options the company has a stock option plan which provides for the granting of nonqualified or incentive stock options to officers  key employees and non employee directors 
options granted under the plan are exercisable over a ten year term 
options not exercised by the end of the term expire 
on june   the company adopted the stock option expensing rules of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company used the modified prospective approach of adoption under sfas no 
r which resulted in the recognition of  and  of compensation cost for the years ended may  and the fair value of each stock option grant has been determined using the black scholes model 
the model considers assumptions related to exercise price  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and the weighted average expected term of the stock option grants 
the company used a weighted average expected term 
expected volatility assumptions utilized in the model were based on volatility of the company s stock price for the thirty month period immediately preceding the granting of the options 
the company issued stock options in august and april the risk free interest rate is derived from the us treasury yield 
the following assumptions were used in the black scholes model in estimating the fair market value of the company s stock option grants august april risk free interest rate expected life of the options years years expected share price volatility expected dividends zero zero these assumptions resulted in estimated fair market value per stock option the ultimate value of the options will depend on the future price of the company s common stock  which cannot be forecast with reasonable accuracy 
a summary of changes in the stock options outstanding during the year ended may  is presented below weighted number of average options exercise price options outstanding and exercisable at may  options granted options outstanding and exercisable at may  capital resources  line of credit and long term debt the company s primary liquidity is dependent upon its working capital needs 
these are primarily inventory  accounts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  accounts payable  accrued commissions  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  and debt service 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have been operations and bank financing 
capital expenditures for the year ended may  were  compared to  in the prior year 
the company has no commitments to make any capital expenditures as of may  through august   the company had a  line of credit with a bank 
there was a  principal balance outstanding as of may   up from the  balance outstanding as of may  the outstanding balance on the line of credit fluctuated as the company s various long term projects progressed effective august   the company replaced its bank credit facility with a  demand line of credit from a different bank  with interest payable at the company s option of   or day libor rate plus or the bank s prime rate less 
there is an interest rate floor of 
the line is secured by accounts receivable  equipment  inventory  and general intangibles 
this line of credit is subject to the usual terms and conditions applied by the bank and is subject to renewal annually 
in conjunction with this new line of credit  the company agreed to the following covenants maintain a minimum working capital position of  at all times  actual working capital at may  was  maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of actual ratio at may  was the bank is not committed to make loans under this line of credit and no commitment fee is charged 
inventory and maintenance inventory may  may  increase decrease raw materials work in process finished goods inventory maintenance and other inventory total inventory turnover inventory  at  as of may   is higher than the prior year end 
of this  approximately is work in process  is finished goods  and is raw materials 
current inventory increased by  or one percent over the may  level of  while this increase is not significant  it is one factor in the decrease in the inventory turnover rate 
the inventory turnover is calculated by dividing the annualized cost of sales by the average inventory level 
the average level of inventory for the year ended may  was  this is  higher than the average level for the fiscal year ended may  this increase is primarily due to the following a 
we have increased the amount of machined components sourced from foreign vendors 
there is a longer lead time to receive these products from the vendors so we maintain a higher level of inventory to meet our requirements 
the cost of maintaining this higher level of inventory is offset by the lower landed cost to purchase the components with the same high level of quality demanded from domestic suppliers 
b 
in an attempt to reduce the lead time to our customers  we have increased the level of inventory of certain seismic components in standard sizes 
while the level of inventory will fluctuate from time to time due to the stage of completion of the non project sales orders in progress at the time  we do not expect that the inventory level will increase significantly from current levels for a sustained period of time 
the company continues to rework slow moving inventory  where applicable  to convert it to product to be used on customer orders 
there was an insignificant amount of slow moving inventory used during the year ended may  the company disposed of approximately  and  of obsolete inventory during the years ended may  and  respectively 
accounts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings cieb  and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings biec may  may  increase accounts receivable cieb less biec net the company combines the totals of accounts receivable  the asset cieb  and the liability biec  to determine how much cash the company will eventually realize from revenue recorded to date 
as the accounts receivable figure rises in relation to the other two figures  the company can anticipate increased cash receipts within the ensuing days 
accounts receivable of  as of may  includes approximately  of amounts retained by customers on long term construction projects 
the company expects to collect all of these amounts  including the retainage  during the next twelve months 
the number of an average day s sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso increased from days at may  to at may  the dso is a function of the level of sales for an average day for example  total sales for the past three months divided by days and the level of accounts receivable at the balance sheet date 
the level of sales for an average day in the fourth quarter of the current year is approximately lower than in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
this is consistent with the overall decrease in revenue for the year 
the level of accounts receivable at the end of the current year is higher than at the end of the prior year 
the combination of these two factors cause the dso to increase from last year end to this 
over of the accounts receivable at may  are less than days old including two thirds of the total that was billed to six customers within six weeks prior to year end 
this compares favorably to the prior year end when of the balance was less than days old including of the total that was billed to two customers within six weeks prior to year end 
for this reason  the company does not expect that accounts receivable are becoming significantly less collectible as noted above cieb represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
whenever possible  the company negotiates a provision in sales contracts to allow the company to bill  and collect from the customer  payments in advance of shipments 
unfortunately  provisions such as this are often not possible 
the  balance in this account at may  is an increase from the prior year end 
this increase from last year end is a reflection of the increase in the number of projects in progress at the two balance sheet dates at may  compared to at may  and in the aggregate  the projects in progress at may  are complete at that date while the projects in progress at may  were complete at that date 
the average total sales value of long term construction projects in process at the end of this year is similar to the end of last year 
generally  if progress billings are permitted under the terms of a project sales agreement  then the more complete the project is  the more progress billings will be permitted 
the company expects to bill the entire amount during the next twelve months 
of the cieb balance as of the end of the last fiscal quarter  february   was billed to those customers in the current fiscal quarter ended may  the remainder will be billed as the projects progress  in accordance with the terms specified in the various contracts 
as of may   there are sales orders for three projects that are not yet in progress 
these projects average  each in value upon completion 
this compares to nine such projects as of the prior year end with an average value of almost  the year end balances in the cieb account are comprised of the following components may  may  costs estimated earnings less billings to customers cieb number of projects in progress as noted above  biec represents billings to customers in excess of revenues recognized 
the  balance in this account at may  is in comparison to no balance at the end of the prior year 
the balance in this account fluctuates in the same manner and for the same reasons as the account costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  discussed above 
final delivery of product under these contracts is expected to occur during the next twelve months 
the year end balances in this account are comprised of the following components may  may  billings to customers less costs less estimated earnings biec number of projects in progress summary of factors affecting the year end balances in the asset cieb  and the liability biec number of projects in progress at year end aggregate percent complete at year end average total value of projects in progress at year end percentage of total value invoiced to customer the company s backlog of sales orders at may  is million  up from the backlog at the end of the prior year of million 
million of the current backlog is on projects already in progress 
accounts payable  at  as of may   is approximately  less than the prior year end 
there is no specific reason for this fluctuation other than the normal payment cycle of vendor invoices 
commission expense on applicable sales orders is recognized at the time revenue is recognized 
the commission is paid following receipt of payment from the customers 
accrued commissions as of may  are  this is higher than the  accrued at the prior year end 
this  increase is reasonable considering the increase in accounts receivable of  the  increase in the current asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and two projects in asia that have no progress billings and higher than normal commission rates 
commission expense related to long term construction projects is recorded at the same time as revenue on the projects is recorded 
this liability will not decrease until progress billings on the projects have been issued by the company and are paid by our customers 
the company expects the current accrued amount to be paid during the next twelve months 
other current liabilities of  increased slightly from the prior year of  management believes that the company s cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations  capital improvements and share repurchases if any for the next twelve months
