item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we describe in detail the effect on our operations of the substantial decline in sales in both the rv segment and the mh segment during and briefly  during  as a result of the severe economic downturn and the resulting decline in shipments by the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries  the two industries to which we sell our products  we suffered a percent decline in our sales from million in to million in our net income declined percent from million in to million in the drop in industry shipments was most severe during the fourth quarter and  as a result  we experienced a net loss of million  for the fourth quarter  which included million related to goodwill impairment and executive retirement charges  compared to net income of million for the fourth quarter 
however  the decline in our net income for the year and fourth quarter would have been substantially greater had it not been for an aggressive program of cost cutting measures and efficiency improvements implemented beginning in the latter part of  as well as the introduction of a variety of new products 
on february   the rvia published its latest forecast of industry production for  which projects a percent decline in the production of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs as compared to in response  the company expects to further reduce fixed costs  workforce  and production capacity to be more in line with anticipated demand 
the company expects that these steps  in conjunction with reductions in working capital  will enable the company to generate cash flow in financing on november   the company and its subsidiaries entered into a new million revolving line of credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na and wells fargo bank  na collectively  the lenders  which expires in december this new credit facility replaced the company s previous million credit facility which was scheduled to expire in june interest rates under the new credit facility are generally higher than under the prior credit facility 
simultaneously  the company entered into a million shelf loan facility with prudential investment management  inc  and its affiliates prudential  replacing the company s previous million shelf loan facility with prudential 
the new shelf loan facility provides for prudential to consider purchasing  at the company s request  in one or a series of transactions  senior promissory notes of the company in the aggregate principal amount of up to million  to mature no more than twelve years after the date of original issue of each note 
prudential has no obligation to purchase the notes 
interest payable on the notes will be at rates determined within five business days after the company issues a request to prudential 
the shelf loan facility expires in november acquisitions on july   lippert acquired certain assets and liabilities  and the business of seating technology  inc and its affiliated companies seating technology  a manufacturer of a wide variety of furniture products primarily for towable rvs  including a full line of upholstered furniture  mattresses  decorative pillows  wood backed valances and quilted soft good products 
seating technology had annual sales of million in the purchase price was million  which was financed from available cash 
subsequent to the acquisition  lippert closed two of seating technology s five leased facilities in indiana  and consolidated those operations into existing facilities 
stock repurchase on november   the company announced a stock repurchase of up to one million shares of its common stock 
the company is authorized to purchase shares from time to time on the open market  or in privately negotiated transactions or block trades 
the number of shares ultimately repurchased  and the timing of the purchases  will depend upon market conditions  share price  and other factors 
during  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share or an aggregate of million 
at present  due to the current economic conditions  the company believes it is to prudent conserve cash  and does not intend to repurchase shares in the short term 
however  changing conditions may cause the company to reconsider this position

mh segment the company s subsidiaries in the mh segment manufacture and market a number of components for manufactured homes and  to a lesser extent  modular housing and office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens  steel chassis  steel chassis parts  axles and thermoformed bath and kitchen products 
in  the mh segment represented percent of the company s consolidated sales  and percent of consolidated segment operating profit 
certain of the company s mh segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes  and certain of the products manufactured by the company are suitable for both manufactured homes and modular homes 
as a result  the company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed 
the mh segment also supplies related products to other industries  representing approximately percent of sales of this segment

detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the mh segment is included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and manufacturing other than the activities of its sales personnel and maintenance of customer relationships through price  quality of its products  service  and customer satisfaction  the company does not engage in significant marketing efforts nor incur significant marketing or advertising expenditures 
the company has several supply agreements or other formal relationships with certain of its customers that provide for prices of various products to be fixed for periods generally not in excess of one year  however  in certain cases the company has the right to renegotiate the prices on sixty days notice 
both the rv segment and the mh segment typically ship products on average within one to two weeks of receipt of orders from their customers and  as a result  neither segment has any significant backlog 
in  the company s facilities operated at an average of approximately percent of their practical capacity  and typically ran one shift of production per day 
therefore  the company has the ability to more than double production should demand increase in the rv or manufactured housing industries 
due to seasonal demand  capacity utilization varies during the year 
at december   the company had facilities  and for most products has the ability to fill demand in excess of capacity at individual facilities by shifting production to other facilities  but the company would incur additional freight costs 
capital expenditures for were million 
the ability to expand capacity in certain product areas  if necessary  as well as the potential reallocation of existing resources  is monitored regularly by management 
the company s operations are somewhat seasonal  as sales are slower in the first and fourth quarters  consistent with the industries which the company supplies

the company holds several united states patents that relate to various products sold by the company  and has granted certain licenses that permit third parties to manufacture and sell products in consideration for royalty payments 
while the company believes that its patents are valuable  and vigorously protects its patents when appropriate  none of the individual patents is essential to the company or its business segments 
from time to time the company has received notices that it may be infringing certain patent rights of others  and the company has given notices to others that they may be infringing certain patent rights of the company 
although the company has asserted patent infringement claims against others  no material litigation is currently pending as a result of these claims

item a 
risk factors 
industry risk factors economic and business conditions beyond our control have had a significant adverse impact on our earnings  and these conditions may continue 
our net sales in fell percent compared to  and net income for declined percent compared to  primarily as a result of the percent decline in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs in  as well as a percent decline in industry wide wholesale production of manufactured homes 
this decline in sales accelerated during the latter part of  and is continuing in on february   the rvia published its latest forecast of industry production for  which projects a percent decline in the production of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs as compared to we attribute these declines to a combination of factors  including the weak economy and resulting recession  tight credit  low consumer confidence  and the deterioration in the real estate and mortgage markets 
as a result  it appears that consumers are reluctant to make purchases of discretionary big ticket items such as rvs and manufactured homes 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these factors have caused a severe decline in the demand and production of rvs and manufactured homes  which has reduced the demand for our products  and therefore significantly reduced our sales during our annual results of operations will likely decline if these conditions persist unabated 
reductions in the availability of wholesale financing limits the inventories carried by retail dealers of rvs and manufactured homes  which causes reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes and reduced demand for our products 
retailer dealers of rvs and manufactured homes generally finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions  often called floor plan financing 
reduction in the availability of wholesale financing has prevented many retailers from carrying adequate inventories of rvs and manufactured homes  which has caused reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
moreover  dealers which are unable to obtain adequate financing could cease operations 
their remaining inventories would likely be sold at deep discounts 
such sales would cause a decline in orders for new inventory  which would reduce demand for our products 
the recession and conditions in the credit market have limited  and could continue to limit  the ability of consumers to obtain financing for rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
there have been significant changes in the lending practices of financial institutions  and many lenders have severely restricted loan availability 
limitations on the availability of financing for rvs and manufactured homes limit the ability of consumers to purchase rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes  and reduced demand for our products 
limited availability of financing for manufactured homes on leased land and higher costs of this financing limits the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes  which would result in reduced demand for our products 
frequently  manufactured homes are purchased  and the land on which they are placed is leased 
loans used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes without land  also known as chattel loans  usually have shorter terms and higher interest rates  and are more difficult to obtain than mortgages for manufactured or site built homes that are on owned land 
historically  lenders required higher credit scores and other criteria for these loans 
current lending criteria are even higher  and many potential buyers of manufactured homes may not qualify 
the availability  cost  and terms of these chattel loans are also dependent on economic conditions  lending practices of financial institutions  governmental policies  and other factors  all of which are beyond our control 
reductions in the availability of financing for manufactured homes and increases in the costs of this financing have limited  and could continue to limit  the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes  resulting in reduced production of manufactured homes and reduced demand for our products 
excess inventories by retailers and manufacturers has caused a decline in the demand for our products 
as a result of the severe decline in sales of rvs and manufactured homes  retailers and manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes may have excess unsold inventory 
existence of excess inventory causes a reduction in orders for new rvs and manufactured homes 
accordingly  in manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes reduced production  which caused a decline in demand for our products 
if these conditions persist  our sales may continue to decline 
high levels of repossessions of manufactured homes and rvs could cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes and rvs  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
repossessed homes are resold by lenders  often at substantially reduced prices  which reduces the demand for new manufactured homes 
currently prevailing economic conditions could result in loan defaults and cause high levels of repossessions  which would cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
in addition  currently prevailing economic conditions could result in defaults of loans used to purchase rvs  resulting in repossessions 
repossessed rvs are resold by lenders  often at substantially reduced prices 
high levels of repossessed rvs would cause manufacturers to reduce production of new rvs resulting in reduced demand for our products 
gasoline shortages  or high prices for gasoline  could lead to reduced demand for our products 
fifth wheel rvs and travel trailers  components for which represent percent of our rv segment sales  are usually towed by suvs or light trucks 
generally  these vehicles use more fuel than automobiles  particularly while towing rvs 
high prices for gasoline  or anticipation of potential fuel shortages  can affect consumer use and purchase of suvs and light trucks which would result in reduced demand for fifth wheel rvs and travel trailers  and therefore reduced demand for our products 
the manufactured housing industry has been experiencing a significant decline in shipments 
our mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  operates in an industry which has been experiencing a decline in production of new homes since initially  the downturn was caused  in part  by limited availability of financing  but has been exacerbated by current economic conditions 
moreover  because of the weak market for conventional housing  retirees may not be able to sell their primary residences  or may be unwilling to sell at currently depressed prices  and purchase less expensive manufactured homes 
in addition  the availability of foreclosed site built homes at reduced prices could impact the demand for manufactured homes 
if these conditions persist  it is not likely that the manufactured housing industry will improve in the short term  and certain of our customers could experience financial difficulties 
these factors could result in reduced demand for products from our mh segment  as well as difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
changes in zoning regulations for manufactured homes could lead to reduced demand for our products 
manufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning regulations 
in the past  there has been resistance by local property owners and zoning officials to zoning ordinances allowing the location of manufactured homes in certain areas comprised of conventional residences 
continued resistance to these zoning ordinances could have an adverse impact on sales and production of manufactured homes  which would reduce demand for our products 
company specific risk factors changes in executive management have been implemented which could affect our operating results 
in november  in accordance with our management succession plan  fredric m 
zinn  executive vice president from to  chief financial officer from to  and president and a director since may  was  in addition to president  appointed chief executive officer 
this appointment became effective january  david l 
webster retired as chairman  president and chief executive officer of kinro  effective january  after more than years with kinro 
jason d 
lippert has assumed responsibility for the operations of kinro  and will also continue as chairman  president and ceo of lippert 
in may  joseph s 
giordano iii  formerly corporate controller and treasurer of the company  was promoted to chief financial officer and treasurer  and christopher l 
smith  formerly assistant controller  was promoted to corporate controller 
although we anticipate that these management transitions will be successful  there can be no assurance at this time 
volatile raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
the prices we pay for steel  which represents about percent of our raw material costs  and other key raw materials  have been volatile and have increased significantly since the impact of higher raw materials costs historically has been substantially offset by sales price increases to our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that such price increases can be continued during the current economic downturn and the decline in the rv and manufactured housing industries 
because competition and business conditions may limit the amount or timing of increases in raw material costs that can be passed through to customers in the form of price increases  future increases in raw material costs would adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
conversely  as raw material costs decline  we may not be able to maintain selling prices consistent with higher cost raw materials in our inventory  which would adversely affect our operating results inadequate supply of raw materials used to make our products could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
if raw materials or components that are used in manufacturing our products  particularly those which we import  become unavailable  or if the supply of these raw materials and components is interrupted  our manufacturing operations could be adversely affected 
increases in labor rates or reduced availability of labor could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
shortages of qualified eligible employees and other factors could result in increased labor costs 
because the current economic downturn and decline in the rv and manufactured housing industries  as well as competition  may limit the amount of labor increases that can be passed through to customers in the form of price increases  increased labor costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
we are involved in certain litigation  which  if decided adversely to us  could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
a case is pending against kinro  purporting to be a class action  in which it is alleged that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro for use in manufactured homes fail to comply with certain safety standards relating to flame spread 
kinro denies the allegations  is vigorously defending against the claims  and based on extensive investigation  believes that the bathtubs are in compliance with applicable regulations 
further detail regarding the litigation is provided in this report in item legal proceedings 
the loss of any customer accounting for more than percent of our consolidated sales could have material adverse impact on our operating results 
one customer of the rv segment accounted for percent  and another customer of both the rv segment and the mh segment accounted for percent  of the our consolidated net sales in the loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results  however  because we sell a variety of products to these customers in several geographic regions  we believe it is unlikely that we would lose the entire business of either of these customers 
the financial condition of several of our significant customers could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
financial difficulties experienced by certain of our significant customers as a result of the sharp decline in sales of rvs and manufactured homes could result in reduced demand for our products  as well as losses due to the inability to collect accounts receivable 
competitive pressures could reduce demand for our products 
domestic and foreign competitors may lower prices on products which currently compete with our products  or develop product improvements  which could reduce demand for our products 
our operating results could continue to decline in a prolonged recession which would affect our liquidity 
if the economic conditions that prevailed during the later part of and the first quarter of continue or worsen  production of rvs and manufactured homes will likely decline even further  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
a further decline in our operating results could affect our liquidity 
however  we have low debt levels and we believe that our cash flow  as well as our credit line and shelf loan facilities  provide adequate sources of liquidity  even though availability of borrowings under these facilities could be limited by our operating results 
additional non cash charges for impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets may be required 
the declines in the industries to which we sell our products have been severe  and demand for our products has declined 
continuation of the downturn in these industries could result in additional non cash impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets

on or about january   an action was commenced in the united states district court  central district of california entitled gonzalez vs 
drew industries incorporated  kinro  inc  kinro texas limited partnership d b a better bath components  skyline corporation  and skylines homes  inc case no 
cv 
the case purports to be a class action on behalf of the named plaintiff and all others similarly situated in california 
plaintiff initially alleged  but has not sought certification of  a national class 
on april   the court issued an order granting drew s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction  resulting in the dismissal of drew industries incorporated as one of the defendants in the case 
plaintiff alleges that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro texas limited partnership  a subsidiary of kinro  inc  and sold under the name better bath for use in manufactured homes  fail to comply with certain safety standards relating to flame spread established by the united states department of housing and urban development hud 
plaintiff alleges  among other things  that sale of these products is in violation of various provisions of the california consumers legal remedies act sec 
et seq  the magnuson moss warranty act sec 
et seq  and the california song beverly consumer warranty act sec 
et seq plaintiff seeks to require defendants to notify members of the class of the allegations in the proceeding and the claims made  to repair or replace the allegedly defective products  to reimburse members of the class for repair  replacement and consequential costs  to cease the sale and distribution of the allegedly defective products  and to pay actual and punitive damages and plaintiff s attorneys fees 
on january   the court issued an order denying certification of a class with plaintiff gonzalez as the class representative 
the court ruled that plaintiff may not be an appropriate class representative for injunctive relief because her bathtub had been replaced 
the court granted plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to add a different plaintiff 
on march   plaintiff amended her complaint to include an additional plaintiff  robert royalty 
plaintiff royalty states that his bathtub was not tested to determine whether it complies with hud standards 
rather  his allegations are based on information and belief  including the testing of plaintiff gonzalez s bathtub and other evidence 
kinro denies plaintiff royalty s allegations  and intends to continue its vigorous defense against both plaintiffs claims 
on june   plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification 
on october   the court again denied certification of a class  without prejudice  which allowed plaintiffs to file a new motion for certification if plaintiffs are able to satisfy the court s concerns over the viability of plaintiffs case 
plaintiffs filed a third motion for class certification on december  defendants initial motion seeking summary judgment against plaintiffs case  which was withdrawn pending further discovery  was supplemented and refiled on december  a hearing on these motions was held on march   but a decision by the court has not yet been received 
defendant kinro has conducted a comprehensive investigation of the allegations made in connection with the claims  including with respect to the hud safety standards  prior test results  testing procedures  and the use of labels 
in addition  at kinro s initiative  independent laboratories conducted multiple tests on materials used by kinro in the manufacture of bathtubs  the results of which tests indicate that kinro s bathtubs are in compliance with hud regulations 
based on the foregoing investigation and testing  kinro believes that plaintiffs may not be able to prove the essential elements of their claims  and defendants intend to vigorously defend against the claims 
moreover  kinro believes that  because test results received by kinro confirm that it is in compliance with hud safety standards  no remedial action is required or appropriate 
in october  the parties participated in voluntary non binding mediation in an effort to reach a settlement 
kinro made an offer of settlement consistent with its belief regarding the merits of plaintiffs allegations 
although no settlement was reached  the parties have since had intermittent discussions 
the outcome of such settlement efforts cannot be predicted 
if plaintiffs motion for class certification is granted  and defendants motion for summary judgment is denied  and if plaintiffs pursue their claims  protracted litigation could result 
although the outcome of such litigation cannot be predicted  if certain essential findings are ultimately unfavorable to kinro  the company could sustain a material liability 
the company s liability insurer denied coverage on the ground that plaintiffs did not sustain any personal injury or property damage 
in connection with a tax audit by the indiana department of revenue pertaining to calendar years to  the company received an initial examination report asserting  in the aggregate  approximately million of proposed tax adjustments  including interest and penalties 
after two hearings with the indiana department of revenue  the audit findings were upheld 
the company filed an appeal in december with the indiana tax court and the matter was scheduled for trial in december in november  the company and the indiana department of revenue reached an agreement in principle to settle tax years to for million  as well as to for million  subject to final documentation 
this amount has been fully reserved  and is expected to be paid in the first half of in the normal course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
all such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
while these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  including anticipated insurance recoveries  any monetary liability or financial impact to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to the company s financial position or annual results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
the company has two reportable segments  the recreational vehicle rv products segment the rv segment and the manufactured housing products segment the mh segment 
the company s operations are conducted through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries  kinro  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  kinro and lippert components  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  lippert 
each has operations in both the rv and mh segments 
at december   the company operated plants in states 
the rv segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent for the rv segment manufactures a variety of products used primarily in the production of rvs  including towable rv steel chassis aluminum windows and screens towable rv axles and suspension solutions chassis components rv slide out mechanisms and solutions furniture and mattresses thermoformed products entry and baggage doors toy hauler ramp doors entry steps manual  electric and hydraulic stabilizer other towable accessories and lifting systems specialty trailers for hauling boats  personal watercraft  snowmobiles and equipment more than percent of the company s rv segment sales are of products used in travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
the balance represents sales of components for motorhomes  as well as sales of specialty trailers and axles for specialty trailers 
travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs accounted for percent and percent of all rvs shipped by the industry in and  respectively  up from percent in the mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  and percent for  manufactures a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes and to a lesser extent  modular housing and office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens steel chassis thermoformed bath and kitchen products steel chassis parts axles other than sales of specialty trailers and related axles  which aggregated million in and million in  sales of products other than components for rvs and manufactured homes are not considered significant 
however  certain of the company s mh segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes  and certain of the products manufactured by the company are suitable for both manufactured homes and modular homes 
as a result  the company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed 
intersegment sales are insignificant 
industry background recreational vehicle industry an rv is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational  camping  travel or seasonal use 
rvs may be motorized motorhomes or towable travel trailers  fifth wheel travel trailers  folding camping trailers and truck campers 
towable rvs represented percent of the  rvs produced in  while motorhomes represented the remaining percent of rvs produced 
motorhomes have a significantly higher average retail selling price than towable rvs  and as a result  sales of motorhomes represented approximately percent of total rv retail sales dollars in the company sells minimal content for folding camping trailers or truck campers 
during  because of severe economic conditions  including low consumer confidence  limited credit availability for both dealers and consumers  and continued weakness in the real estate and mortgage markets  retail sales of rvs declined 
as a result  rv manufacturers significantly reduced their output  which reduced sales by the company in in particular  due to reduced demand  many rv manufacturers temporarily closed a number of production facilities in november  and did not resume production until late january as a result of these conditions  industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary rv markets  declined percent to  units for all of  including a percent decline during the fourth quarter of  according to the recreational vehicle industry association rvia 
while the company tends to measure its rv sales against industry wide wholesale shipment statistics  it believes the underlying health of the rv industry is determined by retail demand  which has declined throughout a comparison of the year over year percentage change in industry wide wholesale shipments and retail shipments  as reported by statistical surveys  inc  of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs for is as follows wholesale retail quarter ended march  quarter ended june  quarter ended september  quarter ended december  year ended december  year ended december  during and  retail sales of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs did not decline as sharply as industry wide wholesale shipments  indicating that dealer inventories declined 
however  recent rv dealer surveys indicate that inventories  although below year earlier levels  are still higher than dealers would prefer in this uncertain economic environment and in light of reduced demand 
industry wide wholesale shipments of motorhomes  components for which represent about percent of drew s rv segment net sales  were down percent during retail sales of motorhomes were down percent for for  the company anticipates the economy will remain weak 
this is expected to cause consumers to be extremely cautious about purchasing discretionary big ticket items  such as rvs 
the rvia has projected a percent decline in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs for to  units 
in addition  the demand for larger travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  which typically contain more of the company s product than smaller units  is declining more rapidly 
on a positive note  in february  the federal reserve indicated that rv consumer and dealer floor plan loans would be included in the term asset backed securities loan facility talf under the troubled assets relief program tarp 
in the long term  the company expects rv sales to be driven by positive demographics  as demand for rvs is strongest from the over age group  which is the fastest growing segment of the us population 
us census bureau projections released in march project that there will be in excess of million more people over the age of by in  the rvia began a generic advertising campaign promoting the rv lifestyle 
the current phase is targeted at both parents aged with children at home  as well as couples aged with no children at home 
the popularity of traveling in rvs to nascar and other sporting events  and using rvs as second homes  also appears to motivate consumer demand for rvs 
manufactured housing industry manufactured homes are built entirely in a factory on permanent steel undercarriages or chassis  transported to the site  and installed pursuant to a federal building code administered by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
the federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and construction  strength and durability  transportability  fire resistance  energy efficiency and quality 
the hud code also sets performance standards for the heating  plumbing  air conditioning  thermal and electrical systems 
it is the only federally regulated national building code 
on site additions  such as garages  decks and porches  often add to the attractiveness of manufactured homes and must be built to local  state or regional building codes 
a manufactured home may be sited on owned or leased land 
industry wide wholesale production of manufactured homes has declined approximately percent since  including a percent decline in  to  homes 
this decade long decline was primarily the result of limited credit availability because of high credit standards applied to purchases of manufactured homes  high down payment requirements  and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site built homes and chattel loans for manufactured homes chattel loans are loans secured only by the home which is sited on leased land 
in addition  in the several years leading up to  many traditional buyers of manufactured homes were able to purchase site built homes instead of manufactured homes  as subprime mortgages were readily available at unrealistic terms 
the institute for building technology and safety ibts reported that for  industry wide wholesale production of manufactured homes decreased percent over during  the size of the average manufactured home also declined 
industry production of smaller single section manufactured homes  average square footage decreased percent during  while larger multi section manufactured homes  average square footage were hit harder  with production declining percent in as a result  total floors produced declined percent this year 
for  multi section manufactured homes represented percent of the total manufactured homes produced  down from percent for  and percent in multi section manufactured homes contain more of the company s products than single section manufactured homes 
the decline in multi section homes over the past few years was apparently partly due to the weak site built housing market  as a result of which many retirees have not been able to sell their primary residence  or may have been unwilling to sell at currently depressed prices  and purchase a more affordable manufactured home 
the company believes that long term growth prospects for manufactured housing are positive because of i the quality and affordability of the home  ii the favorable demographic trends  including the increasing number of retirees  who  in the past had represented a significant market for manufactured homes  iii pent up demand by retirees who have been unable or unwilling to sell their primary residence and purchase a manufactured home  and iv the unavailability of subprime mortgages for site built homes 
in addition  legislation enacted in july increased federal housing administration fha insured lending limits for chattel mortgages for manufactured homes from less than  to nearly  the final regulations were put into place in march  and this could increase demand for new manufactured homes 
further  on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of was enacted 
this law authorizes a tax credit of up to  for qualified first time home buyers purchasing a principal residence during while these factors point to the potential for future growth  because of the current real estate and economic environment  low consumer confidence  and tight credit markets  the company currently expects industry wide wholesale production of manufactured homes to continue to decline in results of operations net sales and operating profit were as follows for the years ended december  in thousands net sales rv segment mh segment total net sales operating profit rv segment mh segment total segment operating profit amortization of intangibles corporate other items total operating profit net sales and operating profit by segment  as a percent of the total  were as follows for the years ended december  net sales rv segment mh segment total net sales operating profit rv segment mh segment total segment operating profit operating profit margin by segment was as follows for the years ended december  rv segment mh segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights net sales for  excluding the impact of sales price increases and acquisitions  decreased million percent from  primarily as a result of the percent decline in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs in  as well as a percent decline in industry wide wholesale production of manufactured homes 
in addition  sales were negatively affected by the percent decline in industry wide wholesale shipments of motorhomes  and the severe industry wide decline in sales of small and medium sized boats  particularly on the west coast  for which the company supplies specialty trailers 
net income for decreased percent from  primarily due to the decrease in net sales and higher raw material costs 
in addition  the company recorded a non cash charge for impairment of goodwill  as well as an executive retirement charge  aggregating million after taxes 
for  the company anticipates a continuing weak economy  a tight credit market  low consumer confidence  volatile fuel prices  and continued weakness in the real estate and mortgage markets 
all of these factors are expected to cause consumers to be extremely cautious  which would likely impact the purchases of discretionary big ticket items  such as rvs 
in response to slow retail sales during  rv manufacturers significantly reduced their output  which negatively affected the company in  and will likely continue into in response to the current economic environment  the company has been extremely proactive and taken the following steps reduced its workforce and production capacity to be more in line with anticipated demand 
closed facilities and reduced fixed overhead costs 
implemented synergies between the operations of kinro and lippert by combining certain administrative functions and sales efforts 
these factors positively affected the company s operating profit in by approximately million  compared to these fixed cost reductions will further benefit operating profit as compared to by over million 
additional cost savings measures are expected to be implemented in these steps also lowered the company s breakeven sales level 
further  the company s strong balance sheet  with minimal debt  and available production capacity  puts it in an excellent competitive position to take advantage of opportunities to increase market share and expand product lines 
on november   the company entered into an agreement for a million line of credit with jpmorgan chase bank  na  and wells fargo bank na simultaneously  the company entered into a million shelf loan facility with prudential investment management  inc  and its affiliates 
at december   the collective availability under these facilities was million 
such availability  along with available cash and anticipated cash flows from operations  is expected to be adequate to finance the company s anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements during on july   lippert acquired certain assets and liabilities  and the business of seating technology  inc and its affiliated companies seating technology  a manufacturer of a wide variety of furniture products primarily for towable rvs  including a full line of upholstered furniture  mattresses  decorative pillows  wood backed valances and quilted soft good products 
seating technology had annual sales of million in the purchase price was million  which was financed from available cash 
subsequent to the acquisition  lippert closed two of seating technology s five leased facilities in indiana  and consolidated those operations into existing facilities 
steel and aluminum are among the company s principal raw materials 
since late  the costs of steel and aluminum have been volatile  and although the company was able to raise sales prices  higher cost raw materials  net of sales price increases  reduced earnings by approximately to per diluted share 
raw material costs have recently declined from their peak levels  largely due to the global economic downturn 
however  the company still has higher priced raw materials in inventory  which will adversely impact operating results for the first few months of  although the impact is estimated to be less than it was in while the company has historically been able to obtain sales price increases to offset the majority of raw material cost increases  there can be no assurance that future cost increases  if any  can be partially or fully passed on to customers 
the company also continues to explore improved product design  efficiency improvements  and alternative sources of raw materials and components  both domestic and imported 
rv segment net sales of the rv segment in decreased percent  or million  as compared to due to an organic sales decline of approximately million  or percent  of rv related products 
this percent decline was due largely to the percent decrease in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary rv market 
in addition  industry wide wholesale shipments of motorhomes  components for which represent about percent of the company s rv segment net sales  were down percent during an organic sales decline of approximately million in specialty trailers  due primarily to a severe industry wide decline in sales of small and medium size boats  particularly on the west coast  the company s primary specialty trailer market 
partially offset by sales generated from and acquisitions aggregating approximately million 
sales price increases of approximately million  primarily due to raw material cost increases 
in  the severe industry wide decline in sales of small and medium sized boats  particularly on the west coast  for which the company supplies specialty trailers  caused the company to record an impairment of the entire million of goodwill of this reporting unit  which is included in the rv segment 
the goodwill impairment charge is reported in other non segment items 
the trend in the company s average product content per rv is an indicator of the company s overall market share 
content per rv is also impacted by changes in selling prices for the company s products 
the company s average product content per type of rv  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for the different types of rvs  for the years ended december  divided by the industry wide wholesale shipments of the different types of rvs for the years ended december  was as follows percent change content per travel trailer and fifth wheel rv content per motorhome content per all rvs the above product content per rv for the year ended december  includes historical sales results for acquisitions  under the assumption the acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of that yearly period 
sales of certain rv components have been reclassified between travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  and motorhomes in prior periods 
according to the rvia  industry production for the years ended december  was as follows percent change travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs motorhomes all rvs operating profit of the rv segment in decreased percent to million largely due to the decline in sales  which was also a factor in the decrease of percentage points in the operating profit margin to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in the decline in rv segment operating profit was percent of the decline in net sales  excluding sales price increases  which is higher than we would typically expect  largely due to the impact of increased raw material costs 
the operating profit margin of the rv segment in was adversely impacted by higher raw material costs 
labor inefficiencies due to the sharp drop in sales during the latter part of the spreading of fixed manufacturing costs over a smaller sales base 
higher health insurance costs 
higher than expected integration costs of the seating technology acquisition  and costs incurred for prototype expenses for potential new customer accounts 
new customer accounts were gained as a result 
an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in  largely due to an increase in bad debt expense  and higher fuel and delivery costs  as well as the spreading of fixed administrative costs over a smaller sales base 
this was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense as a percent of net sales due to reduced operating profit margins 
partially offset by implementation of cost cutting measures 
lower overtime and warranty costs 
as a result of the significant declines in rv sales during  the company s rv segment  while profitable for the year  was unprofitable in the fourth quarter of the company did not have an impairment of the goodwill  other intangible assets or long lived assets in related to its rv business 
at december   the goodwill and other intangible assets of the rv segment aggregated million and million  respectively 
on february   the rvia published its latest forecast of industry production for  which projects a percent decline in the production of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs as compared to in response  the company expects to further reduce fixed costs  workforce  and production capacity to be more in line with anticipated demand 
the company expects that these steps  in conjunction with reductions in working capital  will enable the company to generate cash flow in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the company will perform its annual impairment test as of november   and will continue to monitor the need for additional interim impairment tests 
the company expects to continue performing quarterly evaluations of the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets  based upon the company s stock price which has traded below its book value in early  and the impact of changing market conditions and the company s operating results  which could result in a non cash impairment charge of these assets in the future 
mh segment net sales of the mh segment in decreased percent  or million  from excluding million in sales price increases  net sales of the mh segment declined percent  compared to a percent decrease in industry wide production of manufactured homes 
the organic decrease in sales of the company s mh segment was greater than the manufactured housing industry decline due partly to a reduction in the average size of the homes produced by the manufactured housing industry  which require less of the company s products  and partly due to business the company exited in the latter half of because of inadequate margins 
however  in the latter half of  the company gained market share in the mh segment 
mh segment sales in the fourth quarter included million of components for homes purchased by the federal emergency management agency fema 
the company expects approximately million of additional fema related sales in the first quarter of the trend in the company s average product content per manufactured home is an indicator of the company s overall market share 
manufactured homes contain one or more floors or sections which can be joined to make larger homes 
content per manufactured home and content per floor is also impacted by changes in selling prices for the company s products 
the company s average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for manufactured homes for the years ended december  divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry  respectively  for the years ended december  was as follows percent change content per home produced content per floor produced according to the ibts  industry production for the years ended december  was as follows percent change total homes produced total floors produced operating profit of the mh segment in decreased percent to million largely due to the impact of the decrease in net sales  which was also a factor in the decline in the operating profit margin to percent of net sales in  compared to percent of net sales in the operating profit margin of the mh segment in was adversely impacted by the spreading of fixed manufacturing costs over a smaller sales base 
higher health insurance costs 
an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in due to higher fuel and delivery costs as a percent of net sales  as well as the spreading of fixed administrative costs over a smaller sales base 
partially offset by changes in product mix 
the elimination of certain low margin business exited in the latter half of implementation of cost cutting measures 
improved production efficiencies 
the company has remained profitable in the mh segment despite the percent decline in manufactured housing industry production since the company did not have an impairment of the goodwill  other intangible assets or long lived assets in related to its manufactured housing business  however  the company will continue to monitor these assets for potential impairment  as a continued downturn in this industry or in the profitability of the company s operations  could result in a non cash impairment charge of these assets in the future 
at december   the goodwill and other intangible assets of the mh segment aggregated million and million  respectively 
corporate corporate expenses for decreased million compared to due primarily to a decrease in incentive based compensation as a result of lower profits  partly offset by higher professional fees 
other non segment items in february  the company sold certain intellectual property rights for million  consisting of cash of million at closing and a note of million the note  payable over five years 
the note was initially recorded net of a reserve of million 
in each of and  the company received payments of million including interest  which had been previously fully reserved  and the company therefore recorded a pre tax gain in other income 
the balance of the note was million at december   which is fully reserved 
the company did not receive the final scheduled payment in january  however in february  the company received a payment of million  and is currently attempting to collect the balance due 
other non segment items include the following in thousands year ended december  cost of sales other selling  general and administrative expenses legal proceedings gain on sold facilities loss on sold facilities and write downs to estimated current market value of facilities to be sold incentive compensation impact of other non segment items goodwill impairment before the direct effect on incentive compensation executive retirement other income from the collection of the previously reserved note effective in the third quarter of  gains or losses on sold manufacturing facilities and charges for write downs to estimated current market value of manufacturing facilities to be sold have been reclassified from cost of goods sold to selling  general  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights net sales for decreased million percent from the decrease in net sales was due to an organic sales decline of million percent resulting from declines in both the rv and manufactured housing industries  partially offset by sales of million resulting from acquisitions  and sales price increases of approximately million  primarily to offset material cost increases 
the organic sales decline was due primarily to a percent decline in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs in  as well as an percent decline in industry wide wholesale production of manufactured homes 
despite the sales decline  net income for increased percent from for the following reasons in response to the slowdowns in both the rv and manufactured housing industries  since late  the company closed facilities and consolidated those operations into other existing facilities  and reduced fixed overhead where prudent  including reducing staff levels by more than salaried employees 
these facility consolidations and fixed overhead reductions increased operating profit in by approximately million million after taxes 
improved production and procurement efficiencies 
increased profit margins on certain of the company s newer product lines  particularly in the axle product line  which had been underperforming 
operating profit was reduced by million million after taxes due to losses at the indiana specialty trailer operation which was closed in september lower workers compensation costs which improved operating profit by approximately million million after taxes 
the impact of acquisitions completed in and the incremental impact of acquisitions completed in a reduction in interest expense of million million after taxes due primarily to a decrease in average debt levels 
these favorable factors were partially offset by the negative impact on of spreading fixed manufacturing and administrative costs over a smaller sales base 
an increase in amortization expense of million million after taxes due to acquisitions 
on july   lippert acquired certain assets and liabilities  and the business of extreme engineering  inc extreme engineering  a manufacturer of specialty trailers for high end boats  along with its affiliate  pivit hitch  inc pivit hitch 
extreme engineering and pivit hitch had combined annual sales of million prior to the acquisition 
the purchase price for the two companies was million  including transaction costs  which was financed from available cash 
in  this business was impacted by prolonged declines in industry shipments of small and medium sized boats that worsened late in  and as a result  the company recorded an impairment of the entire goodwill associated with this acquisition 
the company has taken significant steps to improve the results of its specialty trailer business in  including consolidating this operation into one facility shared with other product lines 
on may   lippert acquired certain assets and liabilities  and the business of coach step  a manufacturer of patented electric steps for motorhomes 
coach step had annual sales of million prior to the acquisition 
the purchase price was million  which was financed from available cash 
upon acquisition  the company integrated coach step s business into existing lippert facilities 
on january   lippert acquired trailair  inc trailair and certain assets and liabilities  and the business of equa flex  inc equa flex  two affiliated companies  which manufacture several patented products  including innovative suspension systems used primarily for towable rvs 
trailair and equa flex had combined annual sales of million prior to the acquisition 
the minimum aggregate purchase price was million  of which million was paid at closing and the balance is being paid annually over the five years subsequent to the acquisition 
the aggregate purchase price could increase to a maximum of million if certain sales targets for these products are achieved by lippert over the five years subsequent to the acquisition 
in and  additional purchase price of less than million has been paid 
the acquisition was financed with borrowings under the company s line of credit 
upon acquisition  the company integrated trailair and equa flex s business into existing lippert facilities 
rv segment net sales of the rv segment in decreased percent  or million  as compared to due to an organic sales decline of approximately million  or percent  of rv related products 
the percent organic sales decline in the company s rv related products was lower than the percent decrease in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs excluding an estimated  units purchased by dealers in early related to the gulf coast hurricanes  primarily because the company introduced new products and gained market share 
a decline of approximately million in sales related to the gulf coast hurricanes compared to subsequent to march  there was no significant hurricane related business 
a decline of approximately million in sales of specialty trailers primarily due to the september closure of the indiana specialty trailer operation and a decline in the west coast marine industry 
partially offset by sales resulting from and acquisitions aggregating approximately million 
sales price increases of approximately million  primarily to offset material cost increases 
the trend in the company s average product content per rv is an indicator of the company s overall market share

the company s average product content per type of rv  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for the different types of rvs  for the years ended december  divided by the industry wide wholesale shipments of the different types of rvs for the years ended december  was as follows percent change content per travel trailer and fifth wheel rv content per motorhome content per all rvs sales of certain rv components have been reclassified between travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  and motorhomes in prior periods 
according to the rvia  industry production for the years ended december  was as follows percent change travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs motorhomes all rvs despite the million decline in net sales  operating profit of the rv segment in increased percent to million due to an increase in the operating profit margin to percent of net sales in  compared to percent of net sales in  partially offset by the impact of the decline in sales 
the operating profit margin of the rv segment in was favorably impacted by implementation of cost cutting measures 
improved production efficiencies and global sourcing

the elimination of million in segment operating losses incurred in the company s indiana specialty trailer operation in this operation was closed in september lower workers compensation costs 
a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in  largely due to cost cutting measures implemented and lower delivery costs 
partially offset by the negative impact on of spreading fixed manufacturing and administrative costs over a smaller sales base 
higher warranty costs  based on claims experience  an industry wide increase in the number of months between production and the retail sale of rvs  and an increase in the portion of the company s products that are more complex 
mh segment net sales of the mh segment in decreased percent  or million  as compared to excluding the impact of sales price increases approximately million primarily to offset material cost increases  organic sales of the mh segment decreased approximately million  or percent  compared to an percent decrease in industry wide production of manufactured homes 
the organic decrease in sales of the company s mh segment was greater than the manufactured housing industry decline due partly to a reduction in the average size of the homes produced by the manufactured housing industry  thus requiring less of the company s products  and partly due to a small amount of business the company exited because of inadequate margins 
the trend in the company s average product content per manufactured home is an indicator of the company s overall market share

contingencies on or about january   an action was commenced in the united states district court  central district of california entitled gonzalez vs 
drew industries incorporated  kinro  inc  kinro texas limited partnership d b a better bath components  skyline corporation  and skylines homes  inc case no 
cv 
the case purports to be a class action on behalf of the named plaintiff and all others similarly situated in california 
plaintiff initially alleged  but has not sought certification of  a national class 
on april   the court issued an order granting drew s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction  resulting in the dismissal of drew industries incorporated as one of the defendants in the case 
plaintiff alleges that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro texas limited partnership  a subsidiary of kinro  inc  and sold under the name better bath for use in manufactured homes  fail to comply with certain safety standards relating to flame spread established by the united states department of housing and urban development hud 
plaintiff alleges  among other things  that sale of these products is in violation of various provisions of the california consumers legal remedies act sec 
et seq  the magnuson moss warranty act sec 
et seq  and the california song beverly consumer warranty act sec 
et seq plaintiff seeks to require defendants to notify members of the class of the allegations in the proceeding and the claims made  to repair or replace the allegedly defective products  to reimburse members of the class for repair  replacement and consequential costs  to cease the sale and distribution of the allegedly defective products  and to pay actual and punitive damages and plaintiff s attorneys fees 
on january   the court issued an order denying certification of a class with plaintiff gonzalez as the class representative 
the court ruled that plaintiff may not be an appropriate class representative for injunctive relief because her bathtub had been replaced 
the court granted plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to add a different plaintiff 
on march   plaintiff amended her complaint to include an additional plaintiff  robert royalty 
plaintiff royalty states that his bathtub was not tested to determine whether it complies with hud standards 
rather  his allegations are based on information and belief  including the testing of plaintiff gonzalez s bathtub and other evidence 
kinro denies plaintiff royalty s allegations  and intends to continue its vigorous defense against both plaintiffs claims 
on june   plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification 
on october   the court again denied certification of a class  without prejudice  which allowed plaintiffs to file a new motion for certification if plaintiffs are able to satisfy the court s concerns over the viability of plaintiffs case 
plaintiffs filed a third motion for class certification on december  defendants initial motion seeking summary judgment against plaintiffs case  which was withdrawn pending further discovery  was supplemented and refiled on december  a hearing on these motions was held on march   but a decision by the court has not yet been received 
defendant kinro has conducted a comprehensive investigation of the allegations made in connection with the claims  including with respect to the hud safety standards  prior test results  testing procedures  and the use of labels 
in addition  at kinro s initiative  independent laboratories conducted multiple tests on materials used by kinro in the manufacture of bathtubs  the results of which tests indicate that kinro s bathtubs are in compliance with hud regulations 
based on the foregoing investigation and testing  kinro believes that plaintiffs may not be able to prove the essential elements of their claims  and defendants intend to vigorously defend against the claims 
moreover  kinro believes that  because test results received by kinro confirm that it is in compliance with hud safety standards  no remedial action is required or appropriate 
in october  the parties participated in voluntary non binding mediation in an effort to reach a settlement 
kinro made an offer of settlement consistent with its belief regarding the merits of plaintiffs allegations 
although no settlement was reached  the parties have since had intermittent discussions 
the outcome of such settlement efforts cannot be predicted 
if plaintiffs motion for class certification is granted  and defendants motion for summary judgment is denied  and if plaintiffs pursue their claims  protracted litigation could result 
although the outcome of such litigation cannot be predicted  if certain essential findings are ultimately unfavorable to kinro  the company could sustain a material liability 
the company s liability insurer denied coverage on the ground that plaintiffs did not sustain any personal injury or property damage 
in connection with a tax audit by the indiana department of revenue pertaining to calendar years to  the company received an initial examination report asserting  in the aggregate  approximately million of proposed tax adjustments  including interest and penalties

this amount has been fully reserved  and is expected to be paid in the first half of in the normal course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
all such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
while these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  including anticipated insurance recoveries  any monetary liability or financial impact to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to the company s financial position or annual results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that reduces accounts receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in assessing the collectability of its accounts receivable  the company considers such factors as the current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory reserves may be required 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
warranty the company provides warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold 
the company estimates the warranty accrual based upon various factors  including the company s i historical warranty experience  ii product mix  and iii sales patterns 
the accounting for warranty accruals requires the company to make assumptions and judgments  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
income taxes the company s tax provision is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the tax provision and in evaluating the company s tax position 
the company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that the tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain tax positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
the company adjusts these tax accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the expected outcome of tax audits 
the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets also include deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management s estimate of realizability based upon forecasted taxable income 
realizability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period based upon the company s forecast of future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets  and may result in the recognition of a valuation reserve 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value would be recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test as of november th each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company conducted its annual impairment analysis of the goodwill in all reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fair value of each reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model utilizing observable market data to the extent available  and the company s weighted average cost of capital of approximately percent 
based on the analysis  the carrying value of the specialty trailer reporting unit exceeded its fair value  and as a result  the company recorded an impairment of the entire million of goodwill of this reporting unit 
this business has been impacted by prolonged declines in industry shipments of small and medium sized boats that worsened late in the company has taken significant steps to improve the results of its specialty trailer business  including consolidating this operation into one facility shared with other product lines 
the estimated fair value of the rv and manufactured housing reporting units exceeded their carrying value in  thus no additional impairment was recorded 
on february   the rvia published its latest forecast of industry production for  which projects a percent decline in the production of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs as compared to in response  the company expects to further reduce fixed costs  workforce  and production capacity to be more in line with anticipated demand 
the company expects that these steps  in conjunction with reductions in working capital  will enable the company to generate cash flow in in accordance with sfas no 
 the company will perform its annual impairment test as of november   and will continue to monitor the need for additional interim impairment tests 
the company expects to continue performing quarterly evaluations of the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets  based upon the company s stock price which has traded below its book value in early  and the impact of changing market conditions and the company s operating results  which could result in a non cash impairment charge of these assets in the future 
legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates pending proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel 
these contingencies require the judgment of management in assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
other estimates the company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business related to product returns  accounts receivable  notes receivable  lease terminations  asset retirement obligations  post retirement benefits  stock based compensation  segment allocations  and contingencies 
establishing reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors  as appropriate 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
inflation the prices of key raw materials  consisting primarily of steel  vinyl  aluminum  glass and abs resin are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities  such as the price of oil  rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile 
the company did not experience any significant increase in its labor costs in related to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing activities 
at december   the company had million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
assuming there is a decrease of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings of a similar nature subsequent to december   which the company becomes unable to capitalize on in the short term as a result of the structure of its fixed rate financing  future cash flows would be million lower per annum than if the fixed rate financing could be obtained at current market rates 
at december   the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
assuming there is an increase of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings under these variable rate loans subsequent to december   and outstanding borrowings of million  future cash flows would be reduced by less than million per annum 
at december   the company had million of temporary investments in us treasury short term money market instruments with a current yield of less than percent 
assuming there is a decrease of basis points in the interest rate for these variable rate investments subsequent to december   and total investments of million  future cash flows would be reduced by less than million per annum 
if the actual change in interest rates is substantially different than basis points  or the outstanding borrowings change significantly  the net impact of interest rate risk on the company s cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above 
additional information required by this item is included under the caption inflation in item of this report
