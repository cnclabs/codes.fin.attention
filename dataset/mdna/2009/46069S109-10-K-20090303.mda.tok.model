overview we focus our design  manufacturing and marketing efforts on the high performance analog hpa segment of the semiconductor market 
digital and analog semiconductor components are the basic ingredient in today s electronic devices 
in contrast to the binary nature of digital components  analog components monitor  evaluate and modify electrical signals and strengths allowing them to deal with basic and essential properties such as heat  touch  light and sound 
the hpa segment is distinguished by its highly differentiated and technologically advanced products which can be building blocks for more complex circuits or highly integrated for specific applications 
historically  the hpa segment has yielded higher gross margins and suffers less competition than the digital and broader analog segments of the semiconductor market 
the hpa segment requires uniquely talented and experienced designers  engineers and specialized selling and marketing efforts to address the myriad of challenges associated with today s complex applications 
we began our transformation into an hpa company with the acquisition of elantec in and the divestiture of our wireless networking business in we further strengthened the transformation with the acquisition of xicor 
our transformation has required us to report our financial performance with restructurings  impairments  discontinued operations and write offs attendant to our acquisitions 
our first full year as a pure hpa company was fiscal since then  our focus has resulted in revenue growth that has been very broad based across our many analog products 
we have introduced hundreds of new products in each of the last few years including several new product families that have significantly expanded our served available market 
our investments to expand our product portfolio to over product families appear to be successful  enabling us to reach our primary management goals of revenue growth with higher margins  growing operating income and increasing cash flow generation measured against the investment in the company 
fiscal year is a week fiscal year 
all other periods presented herein as fiscal years include weeks 
fiscal year will have weeks

table of contents geographical revenue millions revenue of total revenue of total revenue of total asia pacific north america europe and other total revenue and cost of revenue revenue our revenue for fiscal year was million  an increase of million or over while fiscal year saw modest revenue growth  revenue during the fourth quarter fell by to million from the third quarter as demand for our products weakened significantly throughout our fourth quarter 
deteriorating global economic conditions resulted in reduced demand for our customer s end products  which caused a severe reduction in orders of our component products 
demand and orders were further reduced during the fourth quarter as our customers began to work down their inventories  resulting in fewer replacement orders throughout the supply chain 
the fourth quarter revenue decline was broad based and was driven by revenue declines from all end markets 
sales into the computing and consumer end markets declined and  respectively  from the third quarter of fiscal year and and  respectively  from the fourth quarter of fiscal year sales into the industrial and communications end market were down and from the third quarter of fiscal year and and from the fourth quarter of fiscal year we are uncertain when  or if  revenue will return to historical levels as visibility of current demand is unclear 
revenue by end market millions revenue increase revenue increase revenue computing communications industrial high end consumer total in aggregate  higher unit demand in fiscal year increased revenues by approximately million and an increase in average selling prices asps increased revenues by approximately million 
of this net revenue growth  approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region and million came from sales to customers in north america with europe and other countries declining approximately million 
in aggregate  higher unit demand in fiscal year increased revenues by approximately million  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices asps which decreased revenues by approximately million 
of this net revenue growth  approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region partially offset by revenue declines of million in north america with no significant changes in 
table of contents europe and other countries 
higher sales of units resulted from our currently strong product offering in computing and consumer power management devices and consumer electronics 
declining sales prices at the product level has been a phenomenon of the semiconductor industry for much of its existence 
while fiscal year did not reflect this decline  we expect sales prices will decline in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that our revenue from asia pacific region customers will continue to grow in percentage terms as that region s economy leads in the manufacture of the finished goods consumer electronics  computers  communications equipment in which our products are used 
end market demand for those products is global  and hence  dependent on aggregate global economic metrics and conditions such as personal incomes and business activity and not necessarily on asian and pacific rim regional economic factors 
see business outlook elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to expected revenues in the near term 
cost of revenue cost of revenues consists primarily of purchased materials and services  labor  overhead and depreciation associated with manufacturing pertaining to products sold 
our gross margin declined by basis points in fiscal year from fiscal year compared to a decrease of basis points in fiscal year from fiscal year the decline in was primarily driven by additional inventory charges taken as a result of our fab consolidation efforts and reduced demand assumptions for our products 
in fiscal year  inventory reserve charges were million compared to million in fiscal year also included a charge of million for impairment on assets held for sale 
the basis point decline in fiscal year was largely a function of our sales mix 
generally  our computing and high end consumer products have lower gross margins than our industrial and communications products 
in fiscal year  much of our revenue increase came from sales of our computing products 
operating expenses research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in product process research  design and development activities  as well as related subcontracting activities  prototype development  cost of design tools and technology license agreement expenses 
our r d expenses increased by to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the approximately million increase in r d expense was due primarily to additional employees and an additional week of labor incurred during fiscal year this increase was partially offset by a reduction in incentive accruals as we did not achieve our performance targets for the second half of fiscal year our r d expenses increased by to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the increase of approximately million in fiscal year is made up of approximately million of increased cash compensation and fringe benefits due to higher headcount and pay levels  offset by a million decline in non cash  stock based compensation charges and other net reductions in supplies and facility costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in selling and marketing our products as well as the salaries and expenses required to perform our human resources  finance  information systems  legal  executive and other administrative functions 

table of contents our sg a expenses decreased by to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily driven by reduced compensation expenses and the reversal of accrued equity compensation taken as a result of the resignation of our former ceo 
the lower compensation expense was driven by reduced incentive compensation as we did not achieve our performance targets for the second half of our sg a expenses decreased by to million for compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year compared to was primarily driven by a reduction in equity based compensation expense of approximately million 
all other sg a costs decreased by approximately million 
impairment of goodwill we recorded an impairment loss of  million against our goodwill in the fourth quarter of  calculated as the excess of carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill in our reporting units 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair market value of the reporting unit 
during  we had five reporting units for purposes of the analysis analog and mixed signal  computing  consumer  industrial and communication  and specialty 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test step one is to identify potential impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no impairment of the goodwill of the reporting unit is indicated and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test step two is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we performed our annual testing for impairment of goodwill as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter of in accordance with fas  we performed step one for each of our reporting units and determined that three reporting units indicated potential impairment 
we then performed step two  which involves calculating the implied fair value of our goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting units to all of our assets and liabilities other than goodwill including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets and comparing the residual amount to the carrying value of goodwill 
for the purposes of this analysis  our estimates of fair value were based on an equal weighting of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices 
the use of projected discounted future results discounted cash flow approach is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business  and also includes a probability weighted expectation as to our future cash flows 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  market multiples and tax rates  amongst other considerations 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis  and that impact these assumptions  may result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
based on the comparison of the residual amount of goodwill  determined after the allocation of fair value to the reporting unit assets and liabilities  to the carrying value of our goodwill as of october   we recorded an initial goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of further  during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform another goodwill impairment analysis as of november  we made this determination based 
table of contents upon a combination of factors  including the significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization below our book value  the deteriorating macro economic environment which resulted in a significant decline in customer demand during the fourth quarter of and illiquidity in the overall credit markets 
step one of the analysis as of november  also indicated potential impairment for three of our reporting units and we further performed the step two allocation of the fair value of the reporting units to the reporting units assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets 
based on the comparison of the residual amount of goodwill  determined after the allocation of fair value to the reporting unit assets and liabilities  to the carrying value of our goodwill  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
goodwill as of january  was million 
if we experience further significant declines in our stock price  market capitalization or future expected cash flows  further significant adverse changes in the business climate or continuing slower growth rates  we may need to perform additional impairment analysis of our goodwill in future periods prior to our annual test in the fourth quarter 
we can provide no assurance that the significant assumptions used in our analysis will not change substantially and any additional analysis could result in additional impairment charges 
amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles for was million  in and  the amortization amounts were approximately million and million 
the increases in and resulted from additional amortization recorded for two acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal year was also affected by two acquisitions in the third quarter of our purchased intangibles  which are definite lived assets  are amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
in process research and development ipr d in fiscal year  we recorded a charge to earnings for million of purchased in process research and development related to the acquisition of zilker labs  inc and daudio inc 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge to earnings for million of purchased in process research and development related to the acquisition of planet ate 
the acquisitions are described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d was the result of the purchase accounting appraisal  for which management is responsible 
the ipr d was determined using an income based or cost based approach to valuation  based on limitations in the market value and income based valuation approaches 
the cost based approach related to approximately two years of historical planet ate research and development expenditures  net of associated tax effects  which relates to the lengthy and risky development life cycle of the typical acquired system ic product for the automated test equipment market 
we expect to continue to invest in these and other development efforts for this new market and believe there is a reasonable chance of successfully completing the work undertaken at the point of the acquisition 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects  and there is no assurance that any will meet either technological or commercial success 
restructurings in april  we announced a plan to consolidate our internal foundries and reduce the related workforce 
in november  in response to the deteriorating global economic environment  we announced further restructuring efforts  that when combined with the foundry consolidation  would reduce our world wide workforce by approximately and result in an estimated combined annual cost savings between million and million 
as of january   approximately affected employees remained employed in order to complete the foundry consolidation project 
this project is expected to be completed during our second quarter of we recorded charges of million for employee severance  facility consolidation  and other costs  as a result of these actions 
other accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes approximately million related to the restructuring 

table of contents other income and expenses interest income our interest income decreased to million in compared to million for interest income decreased in due to decreased average cash balances and continued low interest rates 
our interest income increased to million in compared to million for interest income increased in due primarily to higher balances and rates available in the first half of the year 
in contrast  in the second half of the year  our interest earning balances declined as we conducted our stock repurchase program and funded the acquisition of planet ate 
further  rates began to decline in the second half of the year 
in the fourth quarter of  our interest income declined by over the same quarter of loss gain on certain investments  net during the year ended january   we recorded an impairment charge of million  before taxes  on certain auction rate securities whose decline in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
approximately million impairment was recorded in our first quarter of after significant declines in fair value for two consecutive quarters 
in our fourth quarter of  we further recorded impairment charges of million after global economic conditions deteriorated rapidly and additional securities experienced substantial declines in fair value over two consecutive quarters 
we continue to monitor our auction rate securities and intend to hold all of these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value occurs 
we have a liability for two qualified deferred compensation plans 
we maintain a portfolio of approximately million of mutual fund investments under the two plans 
changes in the fair value of the asset are recorded as a loss gain on investments and changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded as a component of compensation expense 
in general  the compensation expense benefit is substantially offset by the gains and losses on the investment 
during fiscal year  we recorded a loss on investments of million and a reduction of compensation expense of million 
during fiscal year  we recorded gain on investments of million and an increase of compensation expense of million 
income tax benefit expense our income tax benefit from continuing operations was million or in compared to tax expense of million or of pretax income for in fiscal year  income tax benefit from continuing operations included a million reversal of a previously established unrecognized tax benefit utb due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on the tax years through also included was a one time million r d tax credit re enacted by congress at the end of our third quarter 
excluding these items and the effect on income from the impairment charges for goodwill and auction rate securities  the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal year was slightly lower than fiscal year the decrease in rate was primarily due to additional income in lower tax jurisdictions 
the statute of limitations for the and tax years each expired during the first quarter of our fiscal year expiration for tax year was extended to december  by agreement with the internal revenue service irs and tax year was extended to december  by the irs for relief from multiple hurricanes that affected our florida operations in the statute of limitations for the tax year expired during the third quarter of our fiscal year 
our income tax expense from continuing operations was million or of pretax income for compared to tax expense of million or of pretax income for in  we recorded the benefit of approximately million related to the loss on the sale of our interest in a cost method investee 
excluding this item  the tax expense and tax rate would have been comparable to the amounts reported for 
table of contents in the third quarter of  approximately million of previously established utbs related to domestic and foreign tax issues may reverse due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year the benefit will be recorded as part of income tax expense from continuing operations 
our expected effective tax rate in the first quarter of is 
in determining net income  we estimate and exercise judgment in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities and in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  the ultimate tax outcome of many transactions and calculations is uncertain  as the calculation of tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws in the united states and other jurisdictions 
we recognize liabilities for additional taxes that may be due on tax audit issues based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of those issues 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  the final outcome may be different than amounts we estimate 
such determinations could have a material impact on the income tax provision  effective tax rate and operating results in the period they occur 
in addition  the effective tax rate reflected in our forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect our estimates 
discontinued operations and related taxes on discontinued operations in fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit of million for a reversal of a previously established uncertain tax benefit utb due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on the tax years and in fiscal  we recorded an additional tax claim by a foreign jurisdiction 
we incurred research and defense costs of million and ultimately settled the claim for million  net of a million tax reserve 
therefore discontinued operations were a net loss of million for in fiscal  we reached a settlement relating to remaining patent rights litigation connected with our wireless networking product group sale 
after the settlement payment  the remaining accrual of million million net of tax was released and is classified and presented as discontinued operations 
backlog our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders that are generally booked up to six months in advance of delivery 
our standard terms and conditions of sale provide that these orders may not be cancelled or rescheduled thirty days prior to the most current customer request date crd for standard products and ninety days prior to crd for semi custom and custom products 
backlog is influenced by several factors  including market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
additionally  we believe backlog can fall faster than consumption rates in periods of weak end market demand since production lead times can be shorter 
conversely  we believe backlog can grow faster than consumption in periods of strong end market demand as production and delivery times increase and some customers may increase orders in excess of their current consumption to reduce their own risk of production disruptions 
our year end backlog for was million  as of december   it was million  and as of the end of fiscal  it was million 
although not always the case  we believe backlog can be an indicator of performance in the near future 
business outlook as we announced via our fourth quarter earnings press release filed with our current report on form k on january   we anticipated revenues for the first quarter to be in the range of to million 
based on this outlook  we expected a gaap loss per share between and 
despite the loss  we also anticipated continued positive free cash flow 

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the semiconductor industry has  for several decades  experienced a phenomenon of continual decline in sales prices per unit 
this phenomenon brings unique challenges to managing our business 
in order to increase revenues  we must increase units of product made and shipped at a much higher rate than that of the attendant revenue gain 
this leads to capacity and production management issues and requires a large investment in research and development to regularly introduce new products that enable us to maintain our average unit selling prices 
at the same time we are faced with many fixed costs in our business that increase at the same rate of general inflation in the economy and must be managed carefully and aggressively in order to maintain operating margins 
these characteristics of revenue pressure from selling price  the need to invest heavily in research and development and inflation prone fixed costs means that earning a reasonable return for our shareholders is challenging 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations as of january  in millions payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years future minimum operating lease commitments open capital asset purchase commitments open raw material purchase commitments standby letters of credit total our future minimum lease commitments consist primarily of leases for buildings and other real property 
open capital asset purchase commitments primarily include test  assembly and production equipment 
open raw material purchase commitments includes purchase orders for million for externally produced wafers 
we utilize standby letters of credit primarily to provide security for various contracts or services such as workers compensation million  environmental items million and to provide security for certain vendor relationships 
these standby letters of credit have annual renewals 
off balance sheet arrangements the daudio  kenet and zilker purchase agreements contain provisions for payment of additional consideration to former stockholders if revenue in excess of a base amount is attained 
the maximum payout under these provisions is million  based on revenue earned through july due to the uncertainty of revenue in excess of the base amounts  we have not accrued any amount for additional consideration as of january  we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including our dividend program  the 
table of contents requisite capital expenditures for the maintenance of worldwide manufacturing capacity  working capital requirements and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments 
as of january   our total shareholders equity was  million and we had million in cash and short term securities see note 
we have no debt outstanding 
we have million in long term investments  primarily auction rate securities 
these auction rate securities are composed of approximately million of insurance based securities and million of student loan based securities 
we continue to accrue and receive interest on the securities based on a contractual rate 
the weighted rate is currently approximately basis points above one month libor 
on october   we established a million revolving credit facility with bank of america  na as administrative agent and certain other banks 
this credit line increases our available liquidity and enhances our ability to invest in our business 
to date  we have not drawn on the line 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants under the agreement 
our primary sources and uses of cash during the three fiscal years ended january  are presented in this summarized table fiscal years ended jan  dec  dec  millions sources of cash existing business performance and activities operating activities  including working capital changes exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan uses of cash business improvement investments business acquisitions and divestitures  net capital expenditures  net of sale proceeds returned to shareholders stock repurchases dividends paid cash investment management activities decrease increase in investments and foreign exchange effects net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the year ended january   our operational cash including proceeds from stock plans was million compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million 
we used approximately million for capital expenditures and million for acquisitions 
we returned million to shareholders in the form of our stock repurchase and dividend programs 
investment balances were reduced by million compared to an increase of million in the year ended december   resulting in net cash used of million overall 
our aim is to constantly improve the cash flows from our existing business activities and return a substantial portion of that cash flow to shareholders 
we continue to maintain and improve our existing business performance with necessary capital expenditures and acquisitions that may further improve our business and 
table of contents return on investment 
cash  stock or a combination of both may be issued to fund additional acquisitions to improve our business 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments  when combined with no outstanding long or short term debt obligations  give us the flexibility to return free cash flow to our shareholders while also pursuing business improvement opportunities for our future 
non cash working capital trade accounts receivable  less valuation allowances  decreased by million  or  to million as of january  from million as of december  this decrease primarily reflects our decreased sales in the fourth quarter of sales decreased as problems in the economy resulted in our customers utilizing inventory reserves and reducing orders 
our inventories increased by million  or  to million as of january  from million as of december  our days of inventory as of january  significantly exceeded our historical levels due to the extreme decline in revenue we experienced in our fourth quarter of we intend to reduce inventory days closer to historical levels over the next four quarters 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  net of sales proceeds  were million for fiscal year  million for fiscal and million for fiscal capital expenditures have focused primarily on the expansion of available capacity for both our wafer and assembly test partners to support continuing unit volume growth 
currently  we expect capital expenditures to be significantly lower than as we have completed expanding our production capacity 
proceeds from exercises of stock options and our stock purchase plan cash flow from stock plans exercises of stock options and sales under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp was million in  a significant decrease from the million received in we have changed the mix of new share based equity incentive grants to a larger proportion of restricted and deferred stock units than stock options 
restricted and deferred stock units do not yield cash proceeds from an exercise event as do stock options 
therefore exercised option proceeds will continue to decline over the next several years 
additionally  exercises are decisions of grantees and are influenced by the level of our stock price and by other considerations of grantees 
the recent decline in stock price has resulted in many of our options being underwater with exercise prices in excess of the current stock price 
while the level of cash inflow from exercises is difficult to forecast or control  we believe it will remain a secondary source of cash 
stock repurchases and dividends historically  we have returned cash to shareholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs 
our previous stock repurchase program expired on december  in october  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividend was paid on november  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on november  in january  our board of directors also declared a dividend of per share  to be paid on february  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  transactions with related and certain other parties none 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following seven accounting estimation processes to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  distributor  oem and warranty allowances  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  fair value of stock based compensation  and fair value of investments 
these estimates involve estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective and require certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could create changes  including adverse ones  to our statement of operations and financial position 
allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  or receivables allowance january  in millions december  in millions gross trade receivables receivables allowance other allowances net trade receivables our receivables allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables 
since the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding cannot be known until the future  we rely primarily on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have been typically infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being well below of sales 
in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not currently indicate the inability to pay but could have such an inability in the future  we maintain an allowance based on a month rolling average of write offs  which as of january  equaled of our gross trade receivables balance 
we also maintain specific allowances for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible for various reasons  such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify the accounts that are more likely to have collection problems 
we then provide an allowance for a portion or all of the customer s balance based on our evaluation of the ultimate collectability of the account 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded additional specific allowances of million for one customer that is more than days past due 
distributor  oem and warranty allowances  or other allowances allowances for various eventual customer credits are shown in the table above as other allowances 
this is a combination of distributor  original equipment manufacturer oem and warranty allowances 
distributor allowances were million and million as of january  and december   respectively 
revenue is recognized from sales to our customers  excluding north american distributors  when a product is shipped 
sales to international distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors certain price protection on a percentage of unsold inventories they hold 
accordingly  distributor allowances are estimates of the amount of price adjustments that will be encountered in the future on inventory held by international distributors as of the balance sheet date 
we rely primarily on historical international distributor transactions to estimate these adjustments 
the international distributor allowances comprise two components that are reasonably estimable 
the first component is the price protection allowance  which protects the 
table of contents distributors gross margins in the event of falling prices which are common in semiconductors and other electronic components 
this allowance is based on the relationship of historical credits issued to distributors in relation to historical inventory levels and the price paid by the distributor as applied to current inventory levels 
the second component is a stock rotation allowance  which is based on the percentage of sales made to limited international distributors whereby the distributors can periodically receive a credit for unsold inventory they hold 
specific allowances for our oem customers  of which various types of returns are the largest component  totaled million as of january   warranty allowances  returns for which there are product performance claims  totaled million as of january  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory  or inventory allowances we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market as described in the notes to the financial statements 
as the ultimate market value that we will realize through sales on our inventory cannot be known with exact certainty  we rely on past sales experience and future sales forecasts to project it 
in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify certain inventory as either excess or obsolete 
these classifications are maintained for all classes of inventory  although raw materials are seldom deemed excess or obsolete 
we classify inventory as obsolete if we have withdrawn it from the marketplace or if we have had no sales of the product for the past months and no sales forecasted for the next months 
we provide an allowance for of the standard cost of obsolete inventory 
it is our policy to scrap obsolete inventory 
we conduct reviews of excess inventory on a quarterly basis 
we classify inventory as excess if we have quantities of product greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months 
we typically retain excess inventory until the inventory is sold or reclassified as obsolete 
for all items identified as excess or obsolete  management reviews the individual facts and circumstances  ie competitive landscape  industry economic conditions  product lifecycles and product cannibalization  specific to that inventory 
inventory allowances totaled approximately million on gross inventory of million as of january  and million on gross inventory of million as of december  product demand estimates are a key element in determining inventory allowances 
our estimate of product demand requires significant judgment and is based in part on historical revenue 
historical sales may not accurately predict future demand 
if future demand is ultimately lower than our estimate  we could incur significant additional expenses to provide allowances for and scrap obsolete inventory 
assessment of recoverability of goodwill in accordance with sfas  we perform an annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
in  the annual review indicated a substantial decrease in the fair value of our goodwill based on declining stock prices and lower revenue expectations 
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  million against goodwill in the fourth quarter of we will continue to perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist 
see note for further discussion 
goodwill is tested under a two step method for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
as of january   we had five reporting units for purposes of this analysis 
step one is to identify potential impairment 
we compare the calculated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no impairment of the goodwill of the reporting unit is indicated and step two is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the amount of impairment loss is the excess of carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be the new accounting basis 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of fair value for the above analysis 
our estimates of fair value are based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting 
table of contents units based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices 
the use of future discounted cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  market multiples and tax rates  amongst other considerations 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis  and that impact these assumptions  may result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine worldwide income tax liabilities 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate and the actual taxes ultimately payable could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates  in the valuation of deferred tax assets  in tax laws or by material audit assessments  which could affect our profitability 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
as of january   our net deferred tax asset amounted to million compared to million as of december  this increase is primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards nols arising out of recent acquisitions 
fair value of stock based compensation under sfas r  the fair value of the grant compensation cost is calculated by us on the date of grant using a lattice method 
the compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the shorter of vesting life or requisite service period 
calculating fair value requires us to estimate certain key assumptions in the valuation model  including expected stock price volatility  the expected risk free interest rate in the market  expected forfeitures of options by employees due to their termination before vesting is fully earned and annualized dividend yield 
volatility is one of the most significant determinants of fair value 
our expected volatility is estimated from a blend of estimated price movement activity implied by our traded options and the actual historic volatility of our stock price 
we estimate our expected risk free interest rate by using the zero coupon us treasury rate at the time of the grant related to the expected term of the grant 
expected forfeitures must be estimated to reduce the gross calculation of fair value to an amount expected to be recorded in the financial statements 
we estimate forfeitures for the first year of vesting  based on historical information about turnover for each appropriate employee level 
thereafter  as vesting tiers within an option are more frequent until fully vested  forfeitures are no longer estimated but instead recorded as they actually occur 
we estimate the annualized dividend yield by dividing the current annualized dividend by the closing stock price on the date of grant 
calculating fair value for our options and deferred stock units that have a performance measurement element to them also requires us to estimate the likely actual performance before the performance is complete 
we do this by adjusting the forfeiture rate to include the expectation of actual performance at the time the calculation is made for purposes of amortizing the compensation appropriately 
such performance based instruments  depending upon the term of required performance  may need to be remeasured as frequently as quarterly 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information with regard to our performance based grants 
these estimates of key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding future expectations and are re examined on a regular basis 
when such examinations of the key assumptions lead to 
table of contents significant changes to the calculation inputs  it can have a material effect on the amount of stock based compensation that will be recognized in aggregate or in any period 
this may mean more volatility in our reported earnings due to changed facts and circumstances surrounding our use of stock compensation 
fair value of investments under sfas  available for sale and traded securities are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 
for actively traded securities  we generally rely upon the valuations as provided by the custodian of these assets 
for available for sale securities  such as illiquid auction rate securities and preferred stock  we use the present value of expected cash flows to determine fair value 
significant judgments are required in the estimation of fair value  including assumptions about the expected holding period  yield  and appropriate discount rates 
we then evaluate each security to determine whether any impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
our policy assumes that any substantial decline in value for two consecutive quarters is considered other than temporary 
temporary impairments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss  while other than temporary impairments are recorded as a component of non operating income

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk global economic conditions pose a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to the uncertainty around tighter credit and negative financial news 
these conditions could reduce product demand and affect other related matters 
demand could be different from our expectations due to many factors including changes in business and economic conditions  conditions in the credit market that could affect consumer confidence  customer acceptance of our products  changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations and changes in the level of inventory held by vendors 
credit markets are tightening as a result of the recent financial crises  resulting in lower liquidity in many financial markets and excess volatility in fixed income  credit and equity markets 
we could experience a number of resulting effects  including product delays due to effects experienced by key suppliers  reduced orders and payments as customers are affected by tighter credit markets and or insolvency  decreased investing and financing options in a tighter market  increased expenses  increased impairments resulting from lower orders and sales as customers experience difficulties obtaining financing  and volatility and extreme changes in the earnings and fair value of our investments 
moreover  in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  to manage our exposure to these risks 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to three market risks interest rate risk  credit risk and secondary market risk 
our investments are primarily held in money market funds and auction rate securities ars 
some of these investments are insured for credit risk 
ars are subject to the risk that the secondary market might fail to provide the liquidity opportunity at the rate reset points 
this risk  which we have recently encountered with regard to our ars  manifests itself in sponsoring broker dealers withdrawing from the auction process that provides the rate reset and liquidity 
in the first quarter of  we reclassed our short term auction rate securities to long term due to the sustained illiquidity of these securities 
during  we recorded a million impairment of auction rate securities 
we further recorded an additional million unrealized loss against other comprehensive income and a related tax benefit of million  for a net unrealized loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative and qualitative details 
at january   we had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of approximately million to hedge forecasted foreign cash flow commitments up to six months 
as our hedges on forecasted foreign cash flow commitments do not qualify for deferral  gains and losses on changes in the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized as income 
total net gains on foreign exchange contracts were million in realized and unrealized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the statements of operations consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged 
during  we purchased and sold million of foreign exchange forward contracts 
the derivatives were also recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value  which was million  as of january  we believe our cash flow hedges have been economically effective 
the table below summarizes our foreign exchange contract activity over the past two years in millions fiscal year ended january  december  realized gain loss on foreign exchange contracts unrealized gain loss on foreign exchange contracts purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts notional amount of open contracts as of year end fair value of open contracts as of year end 
table of contents our hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments 
a adverse change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held as of january  will have a negligible impact on the fair values of these instruments 
this qualification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair values of foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
a substantial majority of our revenues billed outside the us are billed and collected in us dollars 
therefore we do not believe we have material risk to revenues due to currency rate fluctuations between billing and collection of funds for those amounts billed in other currencies
