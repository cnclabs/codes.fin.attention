item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in part i  item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
business overview we design  develop  manufacture and market proprietary  high voltage  analog integrated circuits ics for use in electronic power supplies  also known as switched mode power supplies 
our ics are used in ac dc and dc dc power supplies in a wide variety of end products  primarily in the consumer  communications  computer and industrial electronics markets 
for example  our ics are commonly used in such products as mobile phone chargers  desktop computers  home entertainment equipment  appliances and utility meters 
we believe that our ics  which typically combine a high voltage transistor with low voltage control circuitry on a monolithic chip  enable power supplies superior to those designed with alternative technologies 
we differentiate our products through innovation aimed at helping our customers meet the desired performance specifications for their power supplies while minimizing complexity  component count  time to market and overall system cost 
we have historically invested significant resources in research and development in an effort to achieve this differentiation 
we derive virtually all of our revenues from the sale of our ics to merchant power supply manufacturers companies that sell power supplies to oems for use with the oems end products and to oems who design and build power supplies for use with their own end products 
the majority of our sales in the twelve months ended december  are made via distributors of electronic components 
we recognize revenue on distributor sales on a sell through basis  ie  when a distributor resells our products to an end customer 
although the power supplies using our products are distributed to end markets worldwide  most of these power supplies are manufactured in asia 
as a result  sales to this region accounted for of our net revenues for the twelve month periods ended december   and december  we expect sales to asian customers to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues in future periods 
our growth strategy includes the following elements increase the penetration of our ics in the low power ac dc power supply market 
the vast majority of our revenue comes from power supply applications requiring watts of output or less 
we continue to introduce more advanced products that make our ic based solutions more attractive in this market 
we have also increased the size of our sales and field engineering staff considerably over the past several years  and we continue to expand our offerings of technical documentation and design support tools and services in order to help our customers use our ics 
these tools and services include our pi expert design software  which we offer free of charge  and our transformer sample service 
capitalize on the growing demand for more energy efficient electronic products and lighting technologies 
we believe that energy efficiency is becoming an increasingly important design criterion for power supplies due largely to the emergence of standards and specifications that encourage  or in some cases mandate  the design of more energy efficient electronic products 
while power supplies built with competing technologies are often unable to meet these standards cost effectively  power supplies incorporating our ics are generally able to comply with all known efficiency specifications currently in effect 
additionally  in response to concerns about the inefficiency of incandescent lighting  policymakers in a number of countries and regions have enacted or proposed policies that could result in more rapid adoption of alternative lighting technologies such as leds 
we believe this presents a significant opportunity for us because our ics are applicable in power supply circuitry for high voltage  or offline  led lighting applications 
expand our addressable market to include applications requiring more than watts of output 
we believe we have developed new technologies that will enable us to bring the benefits of highly integrated power supplies to applications requiring more than watts of output 
for example  in july we announced an extension of our topswitch hx product family that  along with certain system level innovations  enables us to address the market for power adapters used with notebook computers 
in december we introduced hiperplc  our first product designed for 
table of contents applications requiring more than watts  which targets applications such as main power supplies for flat panel tvs  very high efficiency power supplies for pcs and servers  as well as high power led streetlights and industrial controls 
we are applying significant research and development resources toward products that will address additional high power applications in the future 
the addressable market for our ics has historically exhibited a modest growth rate  as growth in the unit volumes of power supplies has largely been offset by reductions in the average selling price of components in this market 
therefore  our ability to penetrate the power supply market and gain market share is generally the most important factor in determining the growth rate of our revenues  income and cash flow 
however  our financial results are also impacted by external factors  particularly economic conditions and supply chain dynamics 
our net revenues for the fourth quarter of decreased by compared with the previous quarter  primarily as a result of weakening macroeconomic conditions  which have caused a reduction in demand for end products that incorporate our ics 
due to further weakening in the global macroeconomic environment  we expect our revenues for the first quarter of to decline significantly compared to the fourth quarter of  and we believe our full year revenues for are likely to be significantly less than our revenues for our net revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the growth of revenue in each of these years primarily reflects the increased penetration of our products into our addressable markets 
however  we believe that our revenue growth in and was negatively impacted by unfair competition from products that we believe infringed several of our patents  and that in the absence of the infringing products  our revenues would have grown more rapidly in each of those years 
we have taken action against these products by undertaking litigation against three of our competitors  fairchild semiconductor  system general corp  and bcd semiconductor manufacturing limited  as described in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
our top ten customers  including distributors that resell to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers  accounted for  and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
our top customer  a distributor  accounted for approximately   and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
in  and  international sales meaning sales outside of north and south america comprised  and  respectively  of our net revenues 
our gross profit  defined as net revenues less cost of revenues  was million  or of net revenues  in  compared to million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in because our industry is intensely price sensitive  our gross margin  which is gross profit divided by net revenues  is subject to change based on the relative pricing of solutions that compete with ours 
also  because we purchase a large percentage of our wafers from foundries located in japan  our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
all else being equal  a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen would result in a corresponding change in our gross margin of approximately one percentage point 
in recent years we have employed a number of tactics in an effort to maintain or  when possible  improve our gross margin 
these include reducing the cost of producing our ics through the implementation of more advanced manufacturing processes  the migration of our testing operations to offshore sub contractors  and the negotiation of more favorable prices from our suppliers 
we also seek to increase the value of our products to our customers through the inclusion of more advanced features and functionality 
finally  we have made an effort to market our products to smaller  less price sensitive customers 
through this combination of methods  we have generally succeeded in improving our gross margin in the recent past 
our gross margin may fluctuate in depending on a variety of factors such as the intensity of competition  the cost of manufacturing our products  the mix of high and low volume orders comprising our revenue  production volume and the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
total operating expenses in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increased in operating expenses in compared to was driven primarily by accelerated stock based compensation expense of million  related to the tender offer we conducted at the end of to repurchase outstanding out of the money stock options 
in addition  in we had a write off of approximately million related to impairment of intangible assets 

table of contents our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and difficult to predict 
our business is characterized by short term orders and short customer lead times  and a high percentage of our revenue comes from turns business  or orders booked and shipped within the same period 
customers typically can cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty 
we plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those listed below 
we base our estimates on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  stock based compensation  estimating sales returns and allowances  estimating distributor pricing credits  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  estimating write downs for excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  and goodwill and intangible assets 
our critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a brief description of these critical accounting policies is set forth below 
for more information regarding our accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenues consist of sales to oems  merchant power supply manufacturers and distributors 
shipping terms to our international oems and merchant power supply manufacturers from our facility in california are delivered at frontier  commonly referred to as daf 
as such  title to the product passes to the customer when the shipment reaches the destination country and revenue is recognized upon the arrival of our product in that country 
beginning in december  shipping terms to our international oems and merchant power supply manufacturers shipped from our facilities outside of the united states are ex works exw  meaning that title to the product transfers to our customer and revenue is recognized upon shipment from our foreign warehouses 
shipments to north and south american oems and merchant power supply manufacturers are fob point of origin  meaning that revenue is recognized upon shipment  which is when title is passed to the customer 
historically  between one half and two thirds of our total sales have been made to distributors pursuant to agreements that allow certain rights of return on our products held by these distributors 
as a result  we defer the recognition of revenue and the costs of revenues derived from sales to distributors until such distributors resell our products to their customers 
the amount we defer is based on the level of actual inventory on hand at our distributors as well as inventory that is in transit to them 
the gross profit that is deferred as a result of this policy is reflected as deferred income on sales to distributors in our consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  effective january  under the provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize the fair value of stock based compensation in financial statements over the requisite service period of the individual grants  which generally equals a four year vesting period 
we have elected the modified prospective transition method for adopting sfas no 
r  under which the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption is 
table of contents recognized in our financial statements in the periods after the date of adoption using the same value determined under the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense for the stock option awards granted subsequent to december  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we use estimates in determining the fair value of these awards 
changes in these estimates could result in changes to our compensation charges 
estimating sales returns and allowances net revenue consists of product revenue reduced by estimated sales returns and allowances 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze  both when we initially establish the reserve  and then each quarter when we review the adequacy of the reserve  the following factors historical returns  current economic trends  levels of inventories of our products held by our distributor customers  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
this reserve represents a reserve of the gross profit on estimated future returns and is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the reserve are recorded as a reduction to net revenue equal to the expected customer credit memo and a corresponding credit is made to cost of revenues equal to the estimated cost of the product to be returned 
the net difference  or gross profit  is recorded as an addition to the reserve 
because the reserve for sales returns and allowances is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to future customer demand and level of acceptance of our products  our reserves may not reflect actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves do not reflect actual sales returns and other allowances  our future net revenues and cost of revenues would be affected  if our reserves were not adequate to reflect actual sales returns and other allowances 
estimating distributor pricing credits historically  between one half and two thirds of our total sales have been made to distributors 
frequently  distributors need a cost lower than the standard distribution price to win business 
after the distributor ships product to its customer under an approved transaction  the distributor submits a ship and debit claim to us to adjust its cost from the standard price to the approved lower price 
after verification by us  a credit memo is issued to the distributor to adjust the sell in price from the standard distribution price to the approved lower price 
we maintain a reserve for these credits that appears as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
any increase in the reserve results in a corresponding reduction in our net revenues 
to establish the adequacy of our reserves  we analyze historical ship and debit amounts and levels of inventory in the distributor channels 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net revenues could be adversely affected 
from time to time we reduce our distribution list prices 
we give our distributors protection against these price declines in the form of credits on products they hold in inventory 
these credits are referred to as price protection 
since we do not recognize revenue until the distributor sells the product to its customers  we generally do not need to provide reserves for price protection 
however  in rare instances we must consider price protection in the analysis of reserve requirements  as there may be a timing gap between a price decline and the issuance of price protection credits 
if a price protection reserve is required  we will maintain a reserve for these credits that appears as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
any increase in the reserve results in a corresponding reduction in our net revenues 
we analyze distribution price declines and levels of inventory in the distributor channels in determining the reserve levels required 
if our reserves do not reflect actual credits  our future net revenues would be affected  which could be adversely affected if our reserves were not adequate to reflect actual credits 
estimating allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for losses we may incur as a result of our customers inability to make required payments 
any increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts results in a corresponding increase in our general and administrative expenses 
in establishing this allowance  and in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance each quarter  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  or if we otherwise underestimate the losses we incur as a result of our customers inability to pay us  we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts which could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents estimating write downs for excess and obsolete inventory when evaluating the adequacy of our valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory  we identify excess and obsolete products and also analyze historical usage  forecasted production based on demand forecasts  current economic trends  and historical write offs 
this write down is reflected as a reduction to inventory in the consolidated balance sheets  and an increase in cost of revenues 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  we may be required to take additional write downs  which could adversely impact our cost of revenues and operating results 
income taxes income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carry forwards that are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
these deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws 
we recognize valuation allowances  which reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we estimate will be more likely than not realized  based upon available evidence and management judgment 
we limit the deferred tax assets recognized related to certain stock based compensation of our officers to amounts that we estimate will be deductible in future periods based upon the provisions of the internal revenue code section m 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to tax credits in certain non us jurisdictions  that we believe are not likely to be realized 
in the event that we determine  based on available evidence and management judgment  that all or part of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future  we would record a valuation allowance in the period the determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin  which we adopted effective january   establishes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
the first step  recognition  occurs when a company concludes based solely on the technical aspects of the tax matter that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
the second step  measurement  is only considered after step one has been satisfied and measures any tax benefit at the largest amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the uncertainty 
tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard  when they are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
california assembly bill on september   california enacted assembly bill which among other provisions  suspends net operating loss deductions for and and extends the carryforward period of any net operating losses not utilized due to such suspension  adopts the federal year net operating loss carryforward period  phases in the federal two year net operating loss carryback periods beginning in and limits the utilization of tax credits to percent of a taxpayer s taxable income 
this change in law did not have a material impact to our effective tax rate or tax provision in the fourth quarter  but will result in approximately million of cash tax obligations for the year ended december  emergency economic stabilization act of the emergency economic stabilization act of  which contains the tax extenders and alternative minimum tax relief act of  was signed into law on october  under the act  the research credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after december  and before january  the effects of the change in the tax law were recognized in our fourth quarter  which is the quarter in which the law was enacted 
as a result of the reinstatement of the federal research credit  we recorded a benefit of approximately million net of reserves in accordance with fin in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents goodwill and intangible assets as of december  we recorded goodwill in the amount of million as a result of our acquisition of potentia semiconductor corporation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or as other indicators exist for a potential impairment 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the implied fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount no impairment adjustment is required 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value  step two will be completed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss  if any exists 
if the carrying value of our single reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference  but not in excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment in  and deemed that no impairment existed as of december  sfas no also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  such as acquired intangibles and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimate undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  we recognize an impairment charge by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
as a result of our ongoing monitoring of asset impairment we performed an analysis of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of  as a result of this analysis we concluded that three of our intangible assets were impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million  as of december  the impairment charge is reflected in a separate caption in our consolidated statement of income line item intangible asset impairment 
please see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data in dollars  as a percentage of total net revenues and the increase decrease over prior periods for the periods indicated in thousands

table of contents consequently  we discuss this first before discussing the various line items in our statement of operations 
our operating expenses and cost of revenues include non cash stock based compensation expenses recognized under sfas r  share based payment 
in these non cash expenses increased significantly compared to due primarily to our completion of a tender offer in december  through which we repurchased million employee stock options 
the tender offer resulted in the recognition of million of stock based compensation expenses in that would otherwise have been recognized over the remaining vesting periods of the tendered options of up to years 
including these accelerated expenses  total stock based compensation expenses in were million  compared with million in we expect our stock based compensation expenses to decrease significantly in the table below compares stock based compensation expenses for and year ended december  stock based compensation expense included in change cost of revenues research development expense sales marketing expense general administrative expense total net revenues 
net revenues consist of revenues from product sales  which are calculated net of returns and allowances  plus license fees and royalties 
net revenues increased by in compared to the increase was driven by increased sales of our products across a wide range of applications in each of our four major end market categories  including mobile phone chargers  led lighting applications  cordless phones  consumer appliances and various other applications 
the increase in net revenues was driven largely by sales of our linkswitch products  which are generally utilized in very low power applications 
the growth in linkswitch sales was partially offset by lower sales of our tinyswitch products  primarily reflecting the loss of a major end customer in the communications market in we have since regained a substantial portion of this lost business with one of our linkswitch products 
we believe our net revenues are likely to decline in as a result of weakening global macroeconomic conditions  which have reduced the demand for end products that utilize our ics 
our net revenue mix by product family and by the end markets served in and are as follows year ended december  product family tinyswitch topswitch linkswitch dpa switch year ended december  end market consumer communications computer industrial electronics other international revenues  comprised of sales outside of north and south america  were million in compared to million in  representing approximately and of net revenues in those respective periods 
although the power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide  most of these power supplies are manufactured by our customers in asia 
as a result  sales to this region were of our net revenues for both and we expect international sales to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues 
distributors accounted for of our net product sales for the twelve months ended december   while of revenues were from direct sales to end customers 
these percentages did not change significantly compared to the same periods in in and  one customer  avnet  a distributor of our products  accounted for approximately and of net revenues  respectively 
no other customer accounted for or more of our net revenues 

table of contents customer demand for our products can change quickly and unexpectedly 
our customers perceive that our products are readily available and typically order only for their short term needs 
our revenue levels are highly dependent on the amount of new orders that we receive for which product can be delivered by us within the same period 
orders that are booked and shipped within the same period are called turns business 
because of the uncertainty of customer demand  and the short lead time environment and proportionally high turns business  it is difficult to predict future levels of revenues and profitability 
gross profit 
gross profit is net revenues less cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the purchase of wafers from our contracted foundries  the assembly and packaging of our products by sub contractors  internal labor and overhead associated with product testing performed in our own facility  and testing of packaged components performed by sub contractors 
gross margin is gross profit divided by net revenues 
the table below compares gross profit for the twelve months ended december  and in millions year ended december  net revenues gross profit gross profit as a of net revenue the decrease in our gross margin in compared to was due primarily to the increase in stock based compensation expense of million associated with the tender offer explained above  which significantly reduced our gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of also impacting our gross margin in the fourth quarter of was an increase to our inventory reserve of approximately million 
we believe our gross profit margin may decrease in as a result of several factors  including the impact of lower fixed cost absorption stemming from lower production levels  as well as the appreciation of the japanese yen compared with the us dollar  which effectively increases the prices we pay for silicon wafers from our japanese foundries 
research and development expenses 
research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses including stock based compensation and expensed material and facility costs associated with the development of new processes and new products 
we also record r d expenses for prototype wafers related to new products until such products are released to production 
the table below compares r d expenses for the twelve months ended december  and in millions year ended december  net revenues r d expenses r d expenses as a of net revenue the increase in r d expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expenses of million recognized in of this amount  million was in conjunction with the tender offer described above 
r d expenses also increased as a result of our acquisition of potentia semiconductor in december  as most of potentia s employees joined our company in research and development functions 
we expect r d expenses to decrease in due to reduced stock based compensation expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including stock based compensation  commissions to sales representatives  and facilities expenses  including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices 
the table below compares sales and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  and in millions 
table of contents year ended december  net revenues sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses as a of net revenue the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of million recognized in of this amount  million was in conjunction with the tender offer described above 
also contributing to the increase was higher headcount related expenses such as salaries and payroll taxes  reflecting growth in our global sales force 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease in due to reduced stock based compensation expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative  or g a  expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including stock based compensation expenses for administration  finance  human resources and general management  as well as consulting  professional services  legal and auditing expenses 
the table below compares g a expenses for the twelve months ended december  and in millions year ended december  net revenues g a expenses g a expenses as a of net revenue the increase in g a expenses in was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of million recognized in the fourth quarter of of this amount  million was in conjunction with the tender offer described above 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in professional services expenses  which were elevated in due to the restatement of our historical financial statements  which was completed during that year 
we expect g a expenses to decrease in compared with due to reduced stock based compensation expenses 
impairment of intangibles 
in the quarter ended december   we recognized a non cash charge of million reflecting the impairment of certain intangible assets 
as a result of our ongoing monitoring of asset impairment we performed an analysis of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of  and concluded we had an impairment of intangible assets related to a certain patent  licensed technology and customer relationships 
we determined that these intangible assets were no longer useful in our manufacturing and sales processes and they were written off completely 
total other income 
total other income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and short term investments 
other income  net totaled million in compared with million in the decrease was due partially to a decrease in interest income on our cash and investment balances  reflecting generally lower interest rates available during the year on cash and short term investments  and a reduction in our overall cash balances as a result of our stock buyback plan 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
provision for income taxes was million for compared to a provision of million for our effective tax rate for was approximately  compared to approximately in the increase in our effective tax rate in compared to was primarily due an increase in the relative amount of non deductible stock based compensation charges and lower profitability in our foreign jurisdictions which is taxed at rates lower than the us rate 
the increase was partially offset by an increase in federal and state research and development tax credits 
comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues increased in compared to the increase in revenues for the year ended december   compared to  was driven by increased penetration of our products across all of our major end markets  comprised of a variety of power supply applications including cellphone chargers  desktop computers  consumer appliances and a range of industrial applications 
the increase in net revenues was driven largely by sales of our 
table of contents linkswitch products  which are targeted primarily at replacing linear power supplies  as well as sales of our tinyswitch iii products  which serve a wide range of power supply applications 
the increase in net revenues was partially offset by reduced revenue from one of our major end customers in the communications market 
manufacturers supplying power supplies to this end customer redesigned their power supplies and in the process chose to use a competing product rather than our products 
our net revenue mix by product family and by the end markets served in and are as follows year ended december  product family tinyswitch topswitch linkswitch dpa switch year ended december  end market consumer communications computer industrial electronics other international revenues  comprised of sales outside of north and south america  were million in compared to million in  representing approximately and of net revenues in those respective periods 
although the power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide  most of these power supplies are manufactured by our customers in asia 
as a result  sales to this region were and of our net revenues for and  respectively 
the increase in sales to asia as a percentage of revenues was driven primarily by the increase in sales of our linkswitch products to customers in the asia region 
net product revenues for were divided to distributors and to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers  compared to to distributors and to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers in in and  one customer  avnet  a distributor of our products  accounted for approximately of net revenues 
no other customer accounted for or more of our net revenues 
gross profit 
the decrease in our gross margin in compared to related primarily to the fact that our gross margin for was positively impacted by the recognition of million in revenues and gross profits as a result of a settlement agreement under which one of our distributors agreed to reimburse us for discrepant ship and debit requests 
research and development expenses 
r d expenses increased by in compared to the primary driver of the increase in r d expenses was an increase in internal personnel and related expenses 
the increase in r d expenses reflects our accelerated investment in both new wafer manufacturing technologies and new product development 
this increase was partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense  as we issued fewer common stock options  and the issue date of such options was later in the year in compared to sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by in compared to the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to increased headcount to increase our global sales capabilities 
expenses related to increased headcount including salaries  payroll taxes  benefits and travel increased by approximately million in compared to this increase was partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense  as we issued fewer common stock options  and the issue date of such options was later in the year in compared to general and administrative expenses 
g a expenses decreased in compared to the decrease was due primarily to lower expenses associated with the special investigation into our practices for granting stock options  and the related restatement of our financial statements 
these expenses totaled approximately million in compared to approximately million in also contributing to the decrease was lower stock based compensation expense  as we issued fewer common stock options  and the issue date of such options was later in the year in compared to 
table of contents in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of potentia semiconductor corporation  we incurred a one time charge of million related to in process research and development for technology that had not reached technological feasibility 
total other income 
the increase in total other income of in compared to was due primarily to an increase in interest income on our cash and investment balances 
interest income grew due to an increase in total cash and investments 
in  investment securities totaled million  and consisted of cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in the increase was also attributable to a million reimbursement for a directors and officers liability insurance claim received in the second quarter of provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
we calculated our provision for income taxes to be million for compared to a provision of million for our effective tax rate for was approximately  compared to approximately in the increase in our effective tax rate in compared to was primarily due to an increase in profit before tax driven by increased sales and a reduction in restatement costs of approximately million 
the increase in our effective tax rate was partially offset by a decrease in the tax effect of non deductable stock based compensation charges 
liquidity and capital resources we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments including million of restricted cash at december  compared to million at december   and million at december  including million of restricted cash in and 
on october   we entered into a security agreement with the union bank of california  whereby we agreed to maintain million in an interest bearing certificate of deposit cd with the bank 
the purpose of this agreement was to secure commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit up to the deposit amount

we recognized million in stock based compensation expenses  which reduced our net income significantly but was not a use of cash 
we also recognized million in depreciation and amortization expenses  which were also non cash expenses 
increases in inventories resulted in a million use of cash 
this increase primarily reflected higher levels of production in anticipation of future growth in sales 
also  our sales in the fourth quarter of were less than expected  reflecting a broad slowdown in the analog semiconductor industry 
higher taxes payable and other accrued liabilities largely offset the cash impact of the increase in inventories  such that the overall net change in operating assets and liabilities did not have a significant impact on cash from operations 
our investing activities for the year ended december  generated cash of million 
this was primarily the result of million in net proceeds from held to maturity investments 
we elected not to reinvest these proceeds in order to utilize this cash in our stock repurchase program  as described below

this use of cash was partially offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of stock through our employee stock purchase plan and as a result of exercises of employee stock options 
on october   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share  to be paid to holders of record as of november  this payment resulted in a million use of cash on december  we intend to pay dividends on a quarterly basis through the end of  which are expected to result in a similar use of cash for each of the four quarters 
during  a significant portion of our positive cash flow was generated by our operations 
if our operating results deteriorate in future periods  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
in that case  we may be forced to use our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund our operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with existing sources of liquidity  will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

the settlement period for our income tax liabilities cannot be determined  however  they are not expected to be due within the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we consider cash invested in highly liquid financial instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
investments in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities greater than three months but not longer than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as short term investments 
investments in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as long term investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage our interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  or for any other purpose 
we invest in high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to facilitate portfolio liquidity 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
at december  and we held primarily cash equivalents and short term investments with fixed interest rates and with maturity dates of less than twelve months 
the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at december  and carrying value approximates fair market value at december  and in thousands  except weighted average interest rates

table of contents the decline in our investment portfolio was due primarily to our use of cash in  mainly the repurchase of our common stock of million during the twelve months ended december  these securities are subject to market interest rate risk and will vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate 
to minimize market risk  most of our investments subject to market risk mature in less than one year  and therefore if market interest rates were to increase or decline by from interest rates as of december  and  the increase or decline in the fair market value of our portfolio on these dates would not have been material 
we monitor our investments for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of our investment exceeds its fair value  and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary  we will reduce the carrying value to its current fair value 
as of december  none of our investments were impaired 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are in asia and western europe and involve contracts with two of our suppliers panasonic and oki 
currently  we do not employ a foreign currency hedge program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts  however  the contract prices to purchase wafers from panasonic and oki are denominated in japanese yen and both agreements allow for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between japanese yen and the us dollar 
one of our other major suppliers  epson  contracts prices to purchase wafers in us dollars  however  the agreement with epson also allows for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between japanese yen and the us dollar 
nevertheless  changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen could subject our gross profit and operating results to the potential for material fluctuations
