critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant estimates in these financial statements include revenue recognition  provision for sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  estimates for useful lives associated with long lived assets  asset impairments  net realizable value of inventories  certain accrued liabilities and provision for income taxes and tax valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures in relation to this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from direct product sales to end user customers upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is upon shipment of the product provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for sales to oems  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for those customers which have a hub arrangement  we recognize revenue when our products are transferred from the hub to the customer s manufacturing facility or to its assembly subcontractor s manufacturing facility 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and possible returns  with the exception of certain products  we defer the recognition of revenue to all our distributors  domestic and foreign  and the related costs of sales until our distributors have sold the merchandise to their end customers 
following a prior period change in our terms and conditions to eliminate return rights for distributors for certain products  we continued to defer revenue recognition until the distributors had sold these parts as we would grant concessions and accept some returns for a period of time after the change 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined we had a sufficient history of not granting concessions to be able to recognize revenue on the non returnable parts upon shipment 
as a result  we recognized revenue of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal our distributors provide us an inventory balance report at the end of each period  which enables us to determine products sold to their end customer 
we recognize revenue from our non recurring engineering nre contracts upon completion of contract milestones  which corresponds to when we provide the services and or products 
revenue is deferred for any amounts received prior to completion of contract milestones  such as amounts received upon delivery of proto type  if such a delivery is an agreed upon milestone 
some of our nre contracts include formal customer acceptance provisions 
in this case  at the end of each period  we determine whether customer acceptance has been obtained for the specific milestone 
if customer acceptance has not been obtained  we defer the recognition of such revenue until customer acceptance is obtained 
sales returns and other allowances we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical experience  analyses of outstanding return material authorization and allowance authorization data and any other form of notification we receive of pending returns 
we continuously monitor and track product returns and in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer return or allowance which is over and above normal historical sales returns  we record a specific allowance against the amounts due  in order to reduce our net receivable from such customer 
while our sales returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that a specific customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example due to bankruptcy  etc in these cases  significant management judgment and estimates must be made based on the best available facts and circumstances 
we record a specific allowance for that customer against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
these specific allowances are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that affects the amount reserved 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
second  a minimum allowance is established for all other customer receivables as a percentage applied to outstanding accounts receivable 
this percentage is based on our historical collection and write off experience 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or net realizable value and include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature and subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
standard manufacturing cost includes materials  labor  and overhead costs including depreciation  and includes factors for estimated production yield and throughput time 
we determine net realizable value of our inventories based on the last selling price  net of selling cost  of our products prior to the balance sheet date 
if there has been no recent sale of a particular product  the expected selling price  net of selling cost is deemed as the net realizable value 
inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value 
any adjustment to write down inventory to net realizable value is charged to the cost of sales in the period that the adjustment is made 
additionally  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand during the next twelve months  which involves a great deal of management judgment on our part 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand and inventories that we consider obsolete are reserved 
we make judgments in establishing inventory reserves and do not establish a reserve if management believes certain excess or obsolete inventory will be sold 
in addition  we age our inventory based on start date 
inventory that has been inactive for more than one year is considered slow moving inventory and is also reserved 
additions to the provision are charged to the cost of sales 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reduction of the allowance until these inventories are subsequently sold or scrapped 
any proceeds received will favorably affect gross margins 
while we have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and consider technological obsolescence when estimating amounts required to reduce recorded amounts to market values  it is possible that such estimates could change in the near term 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and will be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined using various approaches  including discounted future cash flows  independent appraisals or other relevant methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate or amortize over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset where appropriate 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 
historically  we have not had an impairment charge on our long lived assets 

table of contents accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities  which arise from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
such deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base  operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
changes in tax rates affect the deferred income tax assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the tax rates are enacted 
our management must determine the probability that it will be able to utilize its deferred tax assets 
if we determine that recovery is unlikely  then a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset must be recorded by increasing income tax expense 
as of march   we believe that our deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will be utilized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to utilize or recover our deferred tax assets  an additional income tax expense would be incurred in the period in which it was determined that the recovery is not probable 
on february   california governor arnold schwarzenegger signed budget legislation containing significant california tax law changes including tax related economic incentives and tax increases 
the enacted legislation includes an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula for most businesses starting in tax years beginning on or after january  if we adopt such a formula  we expect the california effective tax rate will be lower 
as a result of the legislation  we have revalued our california deferred tax assets expected to be realized after march   which resulted in additional income tax expense of approximately  we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on april  as a change in accounting principle 
fin provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
fin requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate  and consequently affect our operating results 
the fin reserve amount was determined with considerable judgment and estimation  and is continuously monitored by management based on the best information available including changes in tax regulations  the outcome of relevant court cases  ongoing tax audits  and other information 
during the year ended march   the liability for uncertain tax positions less accrued interest and penalties increased from  to  of the total  of uncertain tax benefits   represents the amount that if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods 
we cannot conclude on the range of cash payments that will be made within the next twelve months associated with its uncertain tax positions 
during fiscal  in connection with an examination by internal revenue service irs of our fiscal federal income tax return  we paid a tax liability and interest of  which had been previously accrued 
this payment had been adequately accrued for as of march  see provision for incomes taxes of this section and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock based compensation sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including stock options at fair value  was effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year  which began on april  the adoption of sfas r required us to apply a valuation model  which includes estimates and assumptions on the rate of forfeiture and expected life of options and stock price volatility 
see note and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas r 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period and actual results may differ from estimates 

table of contents accounting for available for sale investments our available for sale portfolio in fiscal includes ars  corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
these securities are reported at fair value in accordance with sfas no  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the ars held by us are primarily backed by pools of student loans and are guaranteed by the united states department of education 
in addition  all ars held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of ars  the fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model and included a discount factor for illiquidity of the ars market 
the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amounts of cash flows  liquidity of the underlying security  expected holding periods and contractual terms of the security 
we review our securities for impairments in accordance with sfas no 
and fasb staff position fsp nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary are charged to the statement of income and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
in light of the current market condition for ars  we developed different scenarios for the significant inputs used in the discounted cash flow model  including  but not limited to liquidity discount from to basis points for the current ars market  and the timing of recovery of ars market from three to five years 
the estimated fair value of our ars ranges from  to  or to of par value 
we believe this estimated range of fair value of our ars is appropriate taking into consideration historical ars market data  the possibility of development of a secondary market for ars  recent market participant behaviors  and public policy implications associated with the student loan based ars market 
we have concluded that the fair value of our ars was  as of march  and recorded a temporary impairment in value of  the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

recent developments we operate in the highly cyclical global semiconductor market  evidenced by fluctuating demand cycles for our products 
from fiscal year  demand had increased steadily in each of the succeeding three fiscal years   and during fiscal year  our sales declined primarily due to a reduction in demand from one of our significant customers  as its products that use our el inverter products experienced significantly reduced sales  this decline continued during fiscal as well 
our overall custom processing services sales reduced in fiscal from and then partially recovered that shortfall in fiscal  although we have not focused on expanding this portion of our business 
during the first half of fiscal our net sales increased over the same period in fiscal  due primarily to medical electronics products which grew and telecom products which grew 
beginning mid way into our third fiscal quarter the effects of the global economic downturn reversed this positive trend  causing our total sales to decline from million in our first half to million in the second half  or a decline 
our current quarterly net sales run rate is approximately million 
on the other hand  we have seen increases in sales of several new products  such as led driver ics for lighting and backlighting applications  and high voltage pulsers for the medical ultrasound market 
quote activity and design wins have been strong in the led lighting and backlighting markets

as such  the assignment of revenue to the aforementioned markets requires the use of estimates  judgment  and extrapolation 
actual results may differ from those reported 
net sales for the fiscal year were  a decrease compared to  for the prior fiscal year  which was primarily due to reduced demand from a major handset customer of el inverters  which are part of our imaging market 
however  sales increased in our medical electronics and led lighting markets 
our sales to the medical electronics market accounted for of total sales in fiscal and increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this sales increase is attributable to higher unit shipments of our high voltage ultrasound pulser ics and medical custom processing services 
these increases were partially offset by reduced selling prices of analog switches and multiplexers and our high voltage ultrasound pulser ics  as we have experienced increased pressure to reduce prices due to increased competition 
in recent years  the overall ultrasound market has been shifting from big console systems to transportable and hand carried ultrasound units  which has driven the ultrasound market growth along with product upgrades for console or stationary systems 
because of space and power constraints  there are more requirements for integration  and with our high voltage ic technology  we have been among the most qualified to support these requirements 
geographically  the market is expanding very rapidly in china  india and many african countries 
traditionally  oems in the united states  germany  and japan have been the main developers and producers of medical ultrasound machines to whom we have sold our products successfully  such as ge  philips  and siemens 
companies in those regions continue to grow and develop new machines  and today we see significant opportunities with medical ultrasound companies in china and south korea 
this market  which began to grow for us in fiscal  continued to flourish in fiscal and  and we expect that it will continue to grow in the coming years due in no small part to china s large governmental stimulus funding for medical infrastructure 
we are expanding our product development activities and product offerings  not only in the transmit side but also in the receive side of the system to capitalize on these exciting market growth opportunities 
through the introduction of our new integrated solutions along with our discrete building block product offerings  we believe we will continue to be a major player in this business 
sales to the imaging market in fiscal decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to significantly reduced demand from a major handset customer using our el inverter products for keypad backlights in its cell phones 
during fiscal  our customer continued to lose market share as this customer s products matured and demand for them declined 
currently  our total sales exposure to the el portion of this target market is very small 
we are one of the key providers of el driver ics for cell phones and are also pursuing el backlighting applications in other products 
in the other major component of imaging  drivers for non impact inkjet printers and plotters  sales were essentially flat in fiscal we are also one of the key providers of driver ics for personal digital assistants pdas  and watches and the leading supplier in the high end industrial printer market  with both standard and custom products 
we believe that when this target market recovers our sales will grow 

table of contents sales to the industrial other market decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal increased sales of drivers for ate products were offset by declines in general industrial markets due to the overall global economic downturn 
sales to the telecom market in fiscal decreased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in sales is primarily due to lower shipments for a military radio application 
sales to the led lighting market of  in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to higher shipments of ics for general lighting applications 
we expect increasing sales to the led target market in fiscal in both backlighting and general lighting due to the introduction of our new line of led backlight driver ics for flat screen tvs and additional new products for general lighting applications

the decreases in sales to china and the asian region are primarily due to the decline in shipments of our el inverters to manufacturing locations in those regions 
the decreases in sales to europe and the united states are primarily due to the global economic downturn 
cost of sales and gross profit gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing raw silicon wafers  cost associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel  facilities  and equipment associated with manufacturing support  and net charges for excess or obsolete inventory 
gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was for fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to lower overall sales  reduced factory utilization  and to a lesser extent reduced average selling prices in certain medical ultrasound products 
these factors were partially offset by reduced costs as we exercised significant cost cutting measures during the second half of fiscal we wrote down inventory totaling of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively

the decrease of  in r d expense for the current year is primarily due to reduced usage of wafer fab services in support of development activities for advanced manufacturing processes of  and lower labor benefits expense of  due to a reduction of  in fair value of the company s deferred compensation plan assets and lower profit sharing bonus 
this was offset by higher payroll expense of  during fiscal  benefits expense related to sfas r was  compared to  in fiscal design win activities remained strong in fiscal resulting in the introduction of ten new products and laying the framework for future new products

these changes in non cash adjustments were partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable and a decrease in deferred revenue  as our distributors reduced the amount of inventory being carried  while in fiscal they increased inventories 
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments  partially offset by sales of short term investments and redemptions of long term investments 
cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal year compared to cash provided of  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we bought  of short term investments more than we sold 
partially offsetting this use of cash were par value redemptions of our ars totaling  our capital expenditures in fiscal of  were lower than in fiscal our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of ars  municipal bonds and money market funds 
the ars we hold have a par value of  and have contractual maturities generally between to years 
they are in the form of auction rate bonds backed by a pool of student loans  whose interest rates were reset every seven to thirty five day reset period through an auction process 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  at the end of each reset period  investors could sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
since the fourth quarter of fiscal  the ars market experienced failures 
in general  for each unsuccessful auction  the interest rate moves to a maximum rate defined for each ars unless the interest earned reaches the maximum amount stipulated by the prospectus 
the principal associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities  or final payments come due according to contractual maturities ranging from to years 
although no assurance can be given  we expect that we will receive the full principal associated with these auction rate securities through one of the means described above 
we received two payments of  and  in july and april  respectively for one ars  representing approximately of our holding of one ars  and another payment of  in december for another ars  representing of our holding of another ars  all parts of which were redeemed at par value 
we continue to believe that the credit quality of the ars we hold is high as they are primarily backed by student loans  are insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education  and continue to be rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
while the recent auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments for some period of time  we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures  or other business requirements 
as of march   we had approximately  of working capital  including approximately  of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  and we have generated cash from our operations for the past several years 
as of march   due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of ars  all of our investments in ars were classified as level and the fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model and included a discount factor for illiquidity of the ars market 
this level fair value of  represents approximately of total assets measured at fair value 
the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amounts of cash flows  liquidity of the underlying security  expected holding periods and contractual terms of the ars 
using this discounted cash flow model  we determined that there was a temporary impairment of  to par value of our ars as of march  this unrealized loss reflects the decline in the estimated fair value of these ars in accordance with sfas we concluded that the impairment losses were temporary in part due to the following 
table of contents the decline in market value is due to unusual general market conditions  recently  some ars were redeemed at par value  these investments are of high credit quality and a significant portion of them are collateralized and are guaranteed by the us department of education  there have been no defaults on the ars we held as of march   their aaa or aaa credit ratings have not been reduced as of march  we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value occurs  and we received two payments of  and  in july and april  respectively for one ars  and a payment of  in december for another ars  representing approximately and of our holdings of two ars  respectively  both of which were partially redeemed at par value 
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the plans and its predecessor plan and sales of stock through the espp  reclassification of non cash excess tax benefit from operating into financing activities as required by sfas r  and repurchases of stock on the open market 
net cash provided in financing activities in fiscal was  primarily from proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options and employee purchases through the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal cash used in financing activities was  during fiscal we bought  shares of our stock on the open market for  whereas during fiscal we did not repurchase any shares 
during fiscal  we amended the espp to decrease the discount afforded to employees from at least to  which satisfied the requirement of a non compensatory plan for sfas r purposes but which reduced the employee participation in the espp 
we expect to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions in fiscal we believe that we have substantial production capacity in place to handle any projected increase in business in fiscal most of our  of property  plant and equipment are located in the united states 
we also believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements through the next twelve months 
fiscal operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal year compared to resulted primarily from a decrease in net income  a decrease in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses compared to an increase in fiscal  and an increase in accounts receivable balance in fiscal compared to a decrease in accounts receivable balance in fiscal  as a higher percentage of sales in fiscal were generated at the end of the year 
also contributing to the reduction in net cash provided by operating activities were greater increases in deferred tax assets and inventories compared to fiscal inventories increased more in fiscal compared to the prior year as sales reduced while factory activity did not reduce proportionately 
in anticipation of higher sales in fiscal we increased inventory levels of certain new products 
partially offsetting these items was an increase in deferred revenue in fiscal compared to a decrease in fiscal investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments  partially offset by sales of short term investments 
cash provided by investing activities was  in fiscal year compared to cash used of  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we sold more ars than we bought in order to fund the repurchase of  shares of our stock on the open market for  our capital expenditures in fiscal were slightly higher than in fiscal

sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and enhances fair value measurement disclosure 
the adoption of sfas did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements  and the resulting fair value calculated under sfas after adoption did not significantly differ from the fair values that would have been calculated under previous guidance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in february  the fasb issued fsp fas which delayed the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the fsp partially defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp march  for us

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to financial market risks primarily due to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our investment securities 
we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments  and our holdings are for purposes other than trading 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of ars  municipal bonds  corporate bonds and commercial paper and money market funds 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of  and  in fiscal year and  respectively 
based on our investments and cash and cash equivalent balance as of march   one percentage point change in interest rates would cause change in our annual interest income in an amount of approximately  compared to  as of march as of march   we had no long term debt outstanding 
ars are subject to the risk that the secondary market might fail to provide the liquidity opportunity at the rate reset points 
this risk  which we have recently encountered with regard to our ars  manifests itself in sponsoring broker dealers withdrawing from the auction process that provides the rate reset and liquidity 
we have recorded an  temporary impairment in value as of march   increased from  as of march  in the event we need to access the funds associated with failed auctions  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 

table of contents the ars we held had contractual maturities generally between to years and had a total par value of  as of march   compared to  as of march  they were in the form of auction rate bonds backed by a pool of student loans  whose interest rates were reset every seven to thirty five days through an auction process prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the ars held by us are backed by student loans and are guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
in addition  all ars held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
as our ars are of high credit rating  we believe the credit risk is very low 
if the issuer of the ars is unable to successfully close future auctions or does not redeem the ars  or the united states government fails to support its guaranty of the obligations  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the ars and record other than temporary impairment charges in future periods  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we expect that we will receive the principal associated with these auction rate securities through one of the means described above 
foreign currency exchange risks we do not hedge any potential risk from any foreign currency exposure 
with our operations in hong kong  we face exposure to an adverse change in the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar 
we believe that our exposure is relatively small  thus we do not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate this foreign currency exposure 
likewise  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
as the level of activity at this operation changes over time  actual currency gains or losses could have an adverse impact to the consolidated financial statements
