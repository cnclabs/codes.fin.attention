general in april our board of directors  after considering reports of consultants and on going analysis of management  decided that the operations of the membership division  comprised of gpaa  llc and ldma au  inc  was no longer strategic to the core business of outdoor channel holdings 
we applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas to the membership division s assets and liabilities classifying them as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations 
the sale of the membership division was for its net asset value and accordingly we have not adjusted its carrying value 
the sale was consummated on april  prior to june   we had reported separate segment information in our filings for the operations of toc and the membership division in the same format as reviewed by our chief operating decision maker 
due to the discontinued operations of the membership division  we now operate in a single segment 
through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  the outdoor channel  inc or toc  we own and operate outdoor channel which is a national television network devoted primarily to traditional outdoor activities  such as 
table of contents hunting  fishing and shooting sports  as well as off road motor sports and other outdoor related lifestyle programming 
outdoor channel holdings  inc also wholly owns bpd  llc that owns the building housing our broadcast facility 
our revenues include advertising fees from advertisements aired on outdoor channel and subscriber fees paid by cable and satellite service providers that air outdoor channel 
advertising fees include fees paid by third party programmers to purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
revenue recognition advertising revenues for outdoor channel are recognized when the advertisement is aired 
subscriber fees for outdoor channel are recognized in the period the programming is aired by the distributor and collection is probable 
broadcast and national television network advertising contracts may guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience for its advertisements over the term of the contracts 
we provide the advertiser with additional advertising time if we do not deliver the guaranteed audience size 
the amount of additional advertising time is generally based upon the percentage of shortfall in audience size 
this requires us to make estimates of the audience size that will be delivered throughout the terms of the contracts 
we base our estimate of audience size on information provided by ratings services and our historical experience 
if we determine we will not deliver the guaranteed audience  an accrual for make good advertisements is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the estimated make good accrual is adjusted throughout the terms of the advertising contracts 
long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  advertising customer relationships and trademarks  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets are less than their carrying value and  accordingly  all or a portion of such carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment losses for assets to be held and used are then measured based on the excess  if any  of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be disposed of in a manner that meets specific criteria are stated at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our only reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit using the market approach 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

table of contents prepaid programming costs we produce a portion of the programming we air on our channels in house as opposed to acquiring the programming from third party producers 
the cost of production is expensed when the show airs 
as such  we have incurred costs for programming that is yet to air 
these costs are accumulated on the balance sheet as prepaid programming costs 
costs of specific shows are charged to programming expense based on anticipated airings  when the program airs and the related advertising revenue is recognized 
at the time it is determined that a program will not likely air  we charge to expense any remaining costs recorded in prepaid programming costs 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may arise if any of our customers are unable to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes the age of customer balances  historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness and trade publications regarding the financial health of our larger customers and changes in customer payment terms when making estimates of the uncollectability of our trade accounts receivable balances 
if we determine that the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorated  whether due to customer specific or general economic issues  increases in the allowance may be made 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires us to record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  for which expense will be recognized over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award  at the date of grant 
sfas r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with this transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
under the modified prospective transition method  share based compensation expense for includes compensation expense for all share based compensation awards granted prior to  but for which the requisite service has not yet been performed as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
share based compensation expense for all share based compensation awards granted after december  is based on the grant date for fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r using the black scholes option pricing model 
we account for stock options granted to non employees using the fair value method 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force or eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and eitf no 
accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees  as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest and is recorded as expense and deferred compensation in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the income tax provision is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 

table of contents with our adoption of sfas r on january  we present  on a prospective basis  the tax benefits from exercise of stock options in excess of recognized expense as a cash flow from financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows rather than as a cash flow from operating activities  as was prescribed under accounting rules applicable through december  this requirement reduces the amount reflected as net cash provided by operating activities and increases net cash provided by financing activities 
total cash flows remained unchanged from that which would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
we recognize such benefits only if they have been realized which we determine by following the tax law method  which provides that current deductions are recognized before realizing the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to all business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after january  the impact of our adoption of sfas r will depend upon the nature and terms of business combinations  if any  that we consummate on or after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas 
sfas clarifies the classification in a company s consolidated balance sheet and the accounting for a disclosure of transactions between the company and holders of noncontrolling interest 
sfas is effective for the company as of january  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  and has been partially deferred for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the partial adoption of sfas for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
under sfas  companies may elect to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings 
we did not elect to use the fair value option 
therefore  the adoption of sfas did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets  fsp no 
that amends the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

fsp no 
requires a consistent approach between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an asset under sfas no 
r  business combinations 
the fsp also requires enhanced disclosures when an intangible asset s expected future cash flows are affected by an entity s intent and or ability to renew or extend the arrangement 
fsp no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and is applied prospectively 
early adoption is prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of fsp no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
the current gaap hierarchy  as set forth in the american institute of certified public accountants 
table of contents aicpa statement on auditing standards no 
 the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  has been criticized because it is directed to the auditor rather than the entity  it is complex  and it ranks fasb statements of financial accounting concepts 
the fasb believes that the gaap hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity not its auditor that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
accordingly  the fasb concluded that the gaap hierarchy should reside in the accounting literature established by the fasb and is issuing this statement to achieve that result 
sfas is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued fsp determining fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active fsp 
fsp clarified the application of sfas no 
in an inactive market 
it demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
fsp was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows

table of contents overview the company s revenue increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to increased advertising revenue reflecting an increase in the rates charged for advertising and time buy rates charged to producers 
cost of services to provide our broadcast signal and programming increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to increases in programming expense and production and operation costs partially offset by reduced satellite transmission fees 
operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to decreased spending on advertising materials and programs and decreases in the selling  general and administrative expenses related to share based compensation which were partially offset by increases in legal and accounting fees and compensation plans for senior executives and newly hired personnel 
interest and other income  net decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to lower interest rates and lower average balances of investment in auction rate and available for sale securities 
revenues our revenues include revenues from advertising fees and subscriber fees 
advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time on outdoor channel including advertisements shown during a program also known as short form advertising and infomercials in which the advertisement is the program itself also known as long form advertising 
advertising revenue is also generated from fees paid by third party programmers that purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel 
subscriber fees are generated from cable and satellite service providers who pay monthly subscriber fees to us for the right to broadcast our channel 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to revenues of  for the year ended december  the net increases were the result of changes in several items comprising revenue as discussed below 
advertising revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in advertising revenue for the year ended december  principally reflects an increase in the rates charged for short form advertising and an increase in the time buy rates charges to producers 
for december  nielsen estimated that outdoor channel had million viewers compared to million for the same period a year ago 
nielsen revises its estimate of the number of subscribers to our channel each month  and for march nielsen s estimate is million 
nielsen is the leading provider of television audience measurement and advertising information services worldwide  and its estimates and methodology are generally accepted and used in the advertising industry 
although we realize nielsen s estimate is typically greater than the number of subscribers on which a network is paid by the service providers  we are currently experiencing a greater difference in these two different numbers of subscribers than we would expect 
we anticipate this difference to decrease as we grow our total subscriber base 
there can be no assurances that nielsen will continue to report growth of its estimate of our subscribers and in fact at some point nielsen might even report additional declines in our subscriber estimate 
if that were to happen  we could suffer a reduction in advertising revenue 
subscriber fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in subscriber fees was primarily due to increases in the subscriber fee rate charged to new and existing service providers carrying outdoor channel and by an increase in subscribers at several service providers 
we are pursuing subscriber growth by utilizing various means including offering lower subscriber fees for broader distribution and payment of subscriber acquisition or launch support fees among other tactics 
such launch support fees are capitalized and amortized over the period that the pay television distributor is required to carry the newly acquired toc subscriber 
to the extent revenue is associated with the incremental subscribers  the amortization is charged to offset the related revenue 
any excess of launch support amortization over the related 
table of contents subscriber fee revenue is charged to expense 
if we are successful with these tactics  our net subscriber fee revenue may decrease over the short term future 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of the cost of providing our broadcast signal and programming to the distributors for transmission to the consumer 
cost of services includes programming costs  satellite transmission fees  production and operations costs  and other direct costs 
total cost of services for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total cost of services was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
programming expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of increased programming expenses associated with new shows and the write off of certain lower quality programs  partially offset by cancellations during the period 
our policy is to charge costs of specific show production to programming expense over the expected airing period beginning when the program first airs 
the cost of programming is generally first recorded as prepaid programming costs and is then charged to programming expense based on the anticipated airing schedule 
the anticipated airing schedule has historically been over or quarters that generally does not extend over more than years 
as the anticipated airing schedule changes  the timing and amount of the charge to expense is prospectively adjusted accordingly 
at the time we determine a program is unlikely to air or re air  we charge programming expense with the remaining associated cost recorded in prepaid programming 
we do not make any further expense or asset adjustments if in subsequent periods demand brings episodes to air that had previously been fully expensed  rather  we consider such events when we review our expected airings prospectively 
our programming costs per show are expected to increase as we continue to improve the quality of our in house produced shows  and we expect our aggregate programming costs to increase somewhat from prior year levels 
as our programming strategy evolves  we will reconsider the appropriate timing of the charge to expense of our programming costs 
satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in satellite transmission fees for year ended december  was primarily due to lower monthly fees associated with our new satellite agreement which became effective in june production and operations costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in costs for the year ended december  relates primarily to an increase of approximately  in broadband services and an increase of approximately  in personnel and related compensation costs associated with increased production and programming 
other direct costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase principally relates to more expense being recognized through amortization of launch support during the year ended december  compared to the same period in because of less revenue being received upon renewal of our affiliation agreement from those service providers to whom we previously paid launch support 
other direct costs may increase over the foreseeable future 
such increases could result from the amortization of subscriber acquisition fees  also referred to as launch support fees  where the costs are in excess of the related subscriber revenue 
other expenses other expenses consist of the cost of advertising  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
total other expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total other expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents advertising expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  was primarily due to expenses related to the launch of our new logo in that did not recur in and a decrease in spending on other advertising materials  programs and campaigns 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately  in share based compensation related to two tranches of performance units granted to our chief executive officer 
share based compensation related to these two tranches of performance units was completely recognized during the year ended december  and no corresponding expense for performance units was recognized during the year ended december  this decrease was partially offset by increased legal and accounting fees of approximately  related to sarbanes oxley compliance costs  the transition of audit and tax service providers and increased used of outside legal services 
also offsetting this decrease was increased compensation related to revised compensation plans for our senior executives and newly hired personnel of approximately  and increases related to annual marketing events during the period of approximately  and an increase to our bad debt expense of approximately  we have added to our professional and support staff across all departments over the past year to support our initiatives in subscriber growth and in other areas such as accounting and finance 
in addition to base salaries and bonuses  we utilize share based compensation packages as incentives for our employees 
we have generally utilized restricted stock grants as opposed to stock options or performance units 
for tax purposes  the tax deduction for restricted stock  subject to the limitations on the deductibility of employee remuneration of internal revenue code section m  is the fair market value of the company s stock on the date the restrictions lapsed eg vesting 
although we may find it necessary to motivate prospective or current employees with additional cash and or equity awards  we anticipate that selling  general and administrative costs will remain relatively consistent over the foreseeable future 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease primarily relates to our infomercial customer relations intangible asset becoming fully amortized as of december   partially offset by increased depreciation related to an increase in fixed assets 
income loss from operations income loss from operations for the year ended december  was income of  a change of  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  as discussed above  the increase in our income from operations was driven by increased prices we are realizing for our advertising inventory and decreased compensation related to share based performance units  offset by growth in our professional and support staff  professional fees and other charges 
as we continue to strive to grow our subscriber base which involves increased advertising expenditures  subscriber rate relief for our carriage partners and the ongoing and planned payment of launch or advertising support  we will continue to incur increased expenses such as broadband  marketing and advertising that are unlikely to be immediately offset by revenues 
as a result  we anticipate our operating margins may be constrained for the short term future until scale is achieved 
there can be no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average balances of investment in auction rate and available for sale securities and the recognition of other than temporary impairment charges related to certain auction rate securities totaling  partially offset by the recognition of a realized gain on sale of auction rate securities of  and a loss on sale of equity securities of  in addition  lower interest rates decreased the interest earned on the average balances of our cash and cash equivalents 
we anticipate a decline in interest earned in future periods 

table of contents income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income loss from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  income tax provision income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  a change of  as compared to  for the year ended december  the income tax provision reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and is different than that computed based on the applicable statutory federal income tax rate of primarily due to state taxes  the tax effect of accounting for share based compensation and the limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation as provided for in internal revenue code section m 
the effective income tax rate was approximately and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the change in pre tax earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december  income loss from continuing operations income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  a change of  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the increase was due to the reasons stated above

advertising revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in advertising revenue for the year ended december  principally reflects higher prices paid for advertising time partially offset by reduced revenue from sales of advertising inventory to third party programmers as a slightly higher percentage of our inventory was retained for in house sales

if that were to happen  we could suffer a reduction in advertising revenue 
subscriber fees for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in subscriber fees was primarily due a decrease in the contractual subscriber fee rate from both new and existing affiliates  partially offset by an increase in subscribers at several service providers 
we are pursuing subscriber growth utilizing various means including deployment of rate relief for new and existing subscribers and payment of subscriber acquisition or launch support fees among other tactics

the improved rate reflects the impact of price increases noted above and reduced programming expense as more fully discussed below 
programming expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for year ended december  the decrease is principally a result of our decision to no longer program a second channel in as we did in and to increase the repeat rate within the schedule of our other in house shows 
our policy is to charge costs of specific show production to programming expense over the expected airing period beginning when the program first airs 
the cost of programming is generally first recorded as prepaid programming costs and is then charged to programming expense based on the anticipated airing schedule 
the anticipated airing schedule has historically been over to quarters that generally did not extend over more than years 
for  the anticipated airing schedule is typically over quarters but might be charged in more than one fiscal year

we do not make any further expense or asset adjustments if in subsequent periods demand brings episodes to air that had previously been fully expensed  rather  we consider such events when we review our expected airings prospectively 
as noted above  we have implemented a new programming strategy which may include more airings per show including a greater number of repeat episodes within the quarter 
as our programming strategy evolves  we will reconsider the appropriate timing of the charge to expense of our programming costs 
satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  production and operations costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in costs principally relates to costs associated with establishing our new broadband web site and costs related to our new broadcast facility 

table of contents other direct costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase principally relates to a greater number of subscribers for which we have paid launch support to acquire in the last half of resulting in more expense recognized through amortization in the year ended december  compared to the same period in other expenses total other expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total other expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is a result of incurring an impairment of amortizable intangible assets in of  for which we did not have a similar charge in the year ended december  and reduced spending on advertising in anticipation during the first half of the year to adopt a new logo and the elimination of our nascar sponsorship 
the decrease in other expenses for the year ended december  was offset by several factors including  of expense related to performance units granted to our chief executive officer in the fourth quarter of  increased legal fees related to negotiation of our carriage agreements and the sale of the membership division  increased accounting fees incurred in related to an increased financial reporting effort and increased professional fees related to consultants hired to help us execute our business plan as well as helping us assess our membership division segment 
advertising expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  we reduced our spending on advertising during related to our print media campaigns and our race program sponsorship 
we have terminated our sponsorship of a nascar team  believing the expenditure will be more effectively deployed otherwise 
further  due to our re branding initiative  we delayed other tactics during the first six months of to fully benefit from our new logo and programming initiatives which was launched during the third quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we granted our chief executive officer two tranches of performance units of  shares each which vest upon our stock price reaching stipulated levels 
we have calculated their fair value using a lattice model 
the first tranche has an estimated value of  and has an expected service period of months 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized  and  respectively  related to this grant 
the second grant of  performance units was calculated to have a fair value of  and an expected service period of months 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized  and  respectively  of compensation expense related to this grant 
the remainder of the increase in selling  general and administrative fees related primarily to consulting fees pertaining to execution of our strategic plan  accounting fees for the audit of our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in related to the fiscal year and related to increased filing requirements in  increased legal fees related to negotiation of carriage relationships and the sale of the membership division and to other operating costs 
impairment of intangible assets for the year ended december  was  we did not incur such a charge in the year ended december  during the three months ended september   we engaged third party consultants to review our business practices and strategy 
among the areas reviewed was our approach to grow our subscriber base through our relationships with msos 
prior to this time our strategy was to focus on incremental growth opportunities without impacting our existing subscriber base 
our consultants completed a market survey and other steps they deemed appropriate 
in september of  the board of directors concluded that a complete revision of the terms of the relationships was necessary to meet the subscriber growth goals established by management 
we reviewed our intangible assets for impairment 
among the components of the plan was subscriber rate relief in some form for both existing subscriber relationships and the incremental if any subscribers that might be added to our subscriber base as a result of the planned actions 
acknowledging the changed circumstances  we assessed fair value of our intangible assets and concluded that our mso relationships asset had become fully 
table of contents impaired 
accordingly we have written off the carrying value of  during the year ended december  we further concluded that the carrying values of our other intangible assets had not been impaired nor do we believe that the changed circumstances have affected the estimated lives of the amortizable intangible assets 
we continue to believe that as of december  the carrying values have not been impaired nor have circumstances changed that affect their estimated lives 
however  these estimates will continue to be reviewed during each reporting period to determine whether circumstances continue to support their estimated useful lives and fair value 
estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the determination of the fair value 
a significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill or the amortizable intangibles and a noncash charge would be required 
such a charge could have a significant effect on our reported net earnings 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to amortization expense of our mso relationship asset recorded prior to its becoming fully impaired and written off during the year ended this decrease was partially offset by a full year of deprecation related to the completion of our new broadcast facility as compared to only eight months of depreciation in the prior year 
income loss from operations income loss from operations for the year ended december  was a loss of  a change of  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  as discussed above  the improvement in our loss from operations was driven by increased prices we are realizing for our advertising inventory  growth in our subscriber base and lower advertising costs as we delayed marketing activities to correspond with the launch of our new branding initiative  lower programming costs as we refined our broadcast airing schedule 
these improvements in our operating results were offset by increased compensation related to our professional and support staff  professional fees and other charges 
for the twelve month comparative periods we incurred an impairment charge related to our mso relationship intangible asset in which did not recur in as we continue to strive to grow our subscriber base which involves increased advertising expenditures  subscriber rate relief for our carriage partners and the ongoing and planned payment of launch or advertising support  we will continue to incur increased expenses such as broadband  marketing and advertising that are unlikely to be immediately offset by revenues 
as a result  we anticipate our operating margins will be constrained for the short term future until scale is achieved 
there can be no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  this improvement was primarily due to increased dividends and interest earned on our increased average balances of our investment in available for sale securities and cash and cash equivalents balances 
additionally  interest expense incurred in the year ended december  relates to the filing of our income tax returns in states in which we had nexus but previously had not filed our income tax returns 
the interest expense incurred in the year ended december  relates to two term loans obtained in november with an original aggregate principal amount of  with effective fixed interest rates of and which we repaid in october income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income loss from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  income tax provision benefit income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  a change of  as compared to an income tax benefit from continuing operations of  for the year 
table of contents ended december  the increase was primarily due to the tax effect of accounting for share based compensation in december  as compared to the amounts recognized to tax expense in the year ended december  the effective income tax rate was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the change in pre tax earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december  income loss from continuing operations income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  a change of  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the reasons stated above 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax for the year ended december  was  a change of  compared to  for the year ended december  net income loss net income loss for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  compared to  for the year ended december  the decreases were due to the reasons stated above 
liquidity and capital resources we generated  of cash from operating activities in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  and had a cash and cash equivalent balance of  at december   an increase of  from the balance of  at december  the increase in cash from operating activities was due primarily to the surplus from operating activities for the year ended december  we also had short term investments classified as available for sale securities of  at december   a decrease of  from the balance of  at december  the investments at december  were comprised of auction rate securities with interest rates that generally reset every days 
net working capital decreased to  at december   compared to  at december  as of december   we held  of auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are investment vehicles with long term or perpetual maturities which pay interest monthly at current market rates reset through a dutch auction 
beginning in february  the majority of auctions for these types of securities failed due to liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets 
our auction rate securities followed this trend and experienced multiple failed auctions due to insufficient investor demand 
as there is a limited secondary market for auction rate securities  we have been unable to convert our positions to cash 
we do not anticipate being in a position to liquidate all of these investments until there is a successful auction or the security issuer redeems their security  and accordingly  have reflected our investments in auction rate securities as non current assets on our balance sheet 
due to these liquidity issues  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these investments 
the assumptions used in preparing the models include  but are not limited to  interest rate yield curves for similar securities  market rates of returns  and the expected term of each security 
in making assumptions of required rates of return  we considered risk free interest rates and credit spreads for investments of similar credit quality 
our auction rate security investments continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  are fully collateralized by underlying financial instruments primarily closed end preferred and municipalities and have maintained aaa aa credit ratings despite the failure of the auction process 
we believe that based on the company s current cash  cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities balances at december   the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flow  financial flexibility or our ability to fund our operations 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact if any on the fair value of our investments 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in fair values does not occur  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities was  in the year ended december  compared to cash used by investing activities of  for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by investing activities related principally to the net difference of sales and purchases of short term auction rate and available for sale securities 
additional capital expenditures were for fixed asset replacements 
cash used in financing activities was  in the year ended december  compared to cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  the cash used by financing activities in the year ended december  was principally the cash used for the purchase and retirement of our common stock in connection with the stock repurchase plan and the purchase and retirement of treasury stock as employees used stock to satisfy withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted shares 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities was principally the proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by the purchase and retirement of treasury stock as employees used stock to satisfy withholding taxes related to vesting of restricted shares

as of december  and as of the date of this report  we did not have any amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
this revolver is guaranteed by toc 
as of december   we had sufficient cash on hand and expected cash flow from operations to meet our short term cash flow requirements 
management believes that our existing cash resources including cash on hand and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations at current levels and anticipated capital requirements through at least december  to the extent that such amounts are insufficient to finance our working capital requirements or our desire to expand operations beyond current levels  we could seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available if needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us 
we have included the contractual obligations assumed in the winnercomm acquisition purchased in january in the following table 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total operating lease obligations principally relate to commitments for delivery of our signal via satellite and office leases

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of  and  respectively 
at december   all of our securities were auction rate securities with long term maturities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 

table of contents however  due to the amount of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time may increase our interest expense 
we do not have transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and as a result we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
as of december  and as of the date of this report  we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
the rate of interest on our line of credit is variable  but we currently have no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
because of these reasons  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material  immediate impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows
