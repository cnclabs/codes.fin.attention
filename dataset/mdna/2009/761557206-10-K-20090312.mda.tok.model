item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands  except per share data the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
overview we operate the leading dining rewards programs in north america by marketing our participating restaurants to members of these programs and by providing incentives to members to dine at these restaurants 
participating restaurants benefit from these marketing efforts  reporting of program results  customer feedback through member comments as well as access to capital that we offer 
in addition to operating the dining rewards program of leading airline frequent flyer programs  clubs and other affinity organizations  we offer our own dining rewards program through our website  www 
rewardsnetwork 
com 
in  we will be celebrating our th year in business 
we market participating restaurants to members principally through the internet and email 
our programs are designed to increase the frequency of dining and the amount spent on dining by members at participating restaurants by providing incentives to members to dine at these restaurants  including airline miles  college savings rewards  reward program points  and cashback rewards sm savings 
as members spend more at participating restaurants  the amount of incentives they receive for dining increases 
we also offer reporting and customer feedback to participating restaurants and provide aggregate data regarding members activity and feedback through comments and ratings gathered from surveys 
in addition  we provide access to capital by purchasing a portion of future member transactions from participating restaurants in bulk and in advance 
bars and clubs also participate in our programs  and for purposes of describing our business  are included when the terms restaurants or merchants are used 
we are paid for our services and  if applicable  receive the portion of a member s transaction that we have purchased only if a member dines at a participating restaurant when rewards are available and pays using a credit or debit card also referred to as a payment card that the member has registered with us 
our revenue per transaction is equal to a percentage of the member s total dining transaction amount 
these revenues are applied to recover our costs where we have purchased a portion of future member transactions  provide rewards to members  cover our selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  and generate operating income that provides a return for our stockholders 
we primarily offer two programs to restaurants our marketing services program and marketing credits program 
in both the marketing services and marketing credits programs  we market participating restaurants to members  offer incentives to members to dine at these restaurants and provide reporting for restaurants on member activity and member feedback 
we also provide restaurants that participate in the marketing credits program with access to capital through our purchase of a portion of future member transactions 
in discussing our business  we use the term dining credits to refer to the portion of future member transactions that we purchase 
our contracts include a separate fee for marketing  reporting on member activity  member feedback and dining rewards programs 
we include all components of the marketing credits program  including the payment for marketing  reporting on member activity  member feedback and dining rewards programs  in marketing credits program sales and net revenues because we analyze our business in this manner 
beginning in december and early  we anticipated a decline in consumer spending and a period of economic and credit uncertainty in the restaurant industry 
we also sought to address our required repurchase of convertible subordinated debentures in the principal amount of  no later than october as a result  we implemented more conservative dining credits purchasing policies and aggressively managed our operating expenses 
during most of  we increased the size of our dining credits portfolio by increasing the amount of dining credits purchased from select restaurants that met our due diligence and risk assessment requirements 

table of contents however  beginning in december and throughout  we saw a decline in consumer spending and increased economic and credit uncertainty in the restaurant industry 
during the second half of  in particular  we experienced a decline in average transaction amount as a result of members spending less at our restaurants  either by spending less on a particular meal or by altering their dining behavior by dining at restaurants with lower prices 
cancellation of corporate holiday events and a decrease in gift card sales also contributed to this trend in the fourth quarter 
even if we were successful in increasing our merchant count and overall member engagement  a decline in member spending could negatively impact several aspects of our business and financial results 
with a decline in consumer spending and a difficult economic environment  we expected that merchants could increasingly default on their obligations to us  including through restaurant closings that could result in an increase in our loss reserve and write offs 
also  the amount of rewards currency that we provide to members is based on the amount the member spends at our restaurants 
a decline in member spending could have made it more difficult for us to meet our minimum purchase obligations for some of our partners rewards currency  which would have caused us to incur costs for rewards currencies that we would not be able to use 
finally  a deterioration of our financial performance could have led to a default under our credit facility with respect to certain financial covenants  which could have limited our liquidity 
in addition  we implemented more conservative dining credits purchasing policies and aggressively managed our operating expenses in order also to meet our obligations to repurchase our convertible subordinated debentures during the fourth quarter of in the principal amount of  in anticipation of the potentially negative impact on our financial results from any deterioration in consumer spending and economic conditions  we took aggressive steps to manage risks in our dining credits portfolio and reduce our ongoing operating expenses 
more conservative dining credits purchasing policies 
we implemented more conservative dining credits purchasing policies during mid in light of the significant economic challenges and the credit uncertainty facing both the restaurant industry and consumers 
we also adjusted these policies to conserve liquidity due to the scheduled redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures during the fourth quarter of in the principal amount of  these more conservative policies were aimed at generally reducing the amount of dining credits we purchased from individual restaurants and shortening the usage periods of the dining credits purchased 
we made the decision to modify the amount of dining credits we purchased based upon our review of internal and external conditions 
we continually evaluate our dining credits purchase policies by monitoring the performance of our dining credits portfolio and observing current economic trends facing the restaurant industry 
in analyzing the appropriate amount of dining credits to purchase and  therefore  the length of the dining credits usage period for a particular restaurant  we considered the overall economic condition of the restaurant industry  the performance of participating restaurants generally and that individual restaurant s credit profile  sales  and history in our program 
we also made our credit requirements more stringent for restaurants seeking to participate in our dining credits program 
in addition to these steps  we also further tightened our credit requirements in the fourth quarter of  in light of the deteriorating economic environment and the corresponding drop in consumer spending 
during the second half of  we also sought to focus our dining credits purchases on the types of restaurants that are most appealing to consumers in light of current conditions 
we expect to continue these more conservative dining credit purchasing policies during this challenging economic period 
we believe that purchasing fewer dining credits from individual restaurants is a conservative approach as we have less capital at risk with any individual restaurant 
we continue to monitor economic developments  member dining behavior and our restaurants business on an on going basis and make business decisions based on the developments that we observe 
in response to the current economic environment  we may take an even more conservative approach with our dining credits purchases in the future in order to manage risk in our dining credits portfolio  which would likely result in a further decrease in the size of our dining credits portfolio and lower future revenues 
we may also increase our loss reserves in response to our assessment of the economy and the performance of our restaurants 

table of contents management of operating expenses 
in addition to actively managing the risk in the dining credits portfolio  we also reduced ongoing operating expenses in order to better position the business to continue to generate operating profit in an uncertain economic environment 
throughout  we reduced member benefits expense  marketing expenses and other operating expenses  including certain headcount reductions 
during the second half of  we were engaged in a project to restructure the member benefits we offer 
we implemented revised benefit offerings with most of our partners that became effective january  as a result of these efforts  with the exception of one partner  we modified the member tier criteria to reward dining at participating restaurants and online engagement by providing the highest level of benefits to members that provide us with current email addresses  agree to receive our marketing promotions  dine frequently and who have completed a specified number of dines at participating restaurants 
we also revised bonus opportunities to encourage members to complete surveys regarding their dining experience 
as a result of our revised benefit offerings to focus on online engagement  member benefit expense decreased to of sales for as compared to of sales for we have driven increases in qualified transactions  active members and overall revenues while lowering marketing and member benefit expense a total of  to  during from  during our new website platform  email marketing and rewards structure have contributed to higher revenues and improved member engagement at a lower cost 
we also reduced member and merchant marketing expense by  to  during from  during as a result of these efforts  marketing expense decreased to of sales for as compared to of sales for we also continued to focus on reducing other operating expenses 
however  we specifically avoided cost reductions that would adversely impact our sales force 
while we see the current environment as challenging  we also see an opportunity to add more restaurants to our programs 
so we continue our investment in the sales force and intend to maintain full staffing levels 
despite our more conservative approach to our dining credits portfolio in  we generated higher sales and increased profitability 
with strong operating cash flows  we repurchased the entire balance of our convertible subordinated debentures out of cash and cash equivalents and operate free of debt 
as a result of our more conservative dining credits purchasing policies that lowered the average amount of capital at risk  our net dining credits portfolio decreased to  as of december  from  as of december  and our net dining credits usage period decreased to months at december  from months at december  we purchased fewer dining credits from individual restaurants  but we increased the total number of restaurants on our program from  at the end of to  at the end of the mix of our restaurants changed so that by the end of the number of our marketing credits program restaurants decreased by while the number of our marketing services program restaurants increased by while our merchant mix changed throughout the year  we still generated higher sales than the prior year 
generally  a consequence of our purchase of fewer dining credits was a higher purchase price for the dining credits  which resulted in increased cost of sales 
in order to maintain profitability of marketing credits program restaurants that had a higher cost of sales  we required a higher sales yield in our deals with those restaurants 
higher sales yield increased the amount of each member transaction we retained as marketing credits program sales 
higher sales yields also resulted in a decrease in member benefit expense as a percentage of each transaction that partially or completely offset the increased cost of sales on that transaction 
as a result of our increase in sales  more conservative dining credits purchasing policies and our focus on controlling expenses  we achieved profitable sales growth for the full year of we generated strong operating cash flows throughout that enabled us to repurchase our convertible subordinated debentures throughout the year from our cash and cash equivalents balances 
we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and continue to operate on a debt free basis 

table of contents we have also made changes to our partner programs and invested in technology to market participating restaurants through new social media 
in october  we terminated our relationship with continental airlines and we no longer support its mileage currency 
members in this program interested in earning dining rewards on an ongoing basis were encouraged to sign up for an alternate rewards network dining program 
in november  we launched a new partnership with southwest airlines 
this new partnership features southwest s rewards credits as the members preferred currency and is being promoted across the united states to acquire new members who are influenced by the value of this currency 
we also began investing time and resources in developing new social media functionality and creating a promotional presence in several social networks 
we intend to continue to invest in these areas and further establish rewards network in social media networks throughout and beyond 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for losses  the valuation allowance  if any  for net deferred tax assets  goodwill  revenue recognition and legal contingencies 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for losses we provide allowances for dining credits losses and accounts receivables based on our estimate of losses that would result from the inability of participating merchants to remain in business or our merchant s unwillingness to honor their obligations relating to dining credits and accounts receivables 
if the financial condition of our merchant base were to deteriorate beyond our expectations  resulting in participating merchants inability to provide food  beverage  goods and services to members thereby reducing the redemption of dining credits  or if merchants are unwilling or otherwise unable to honor their obligations relating to dining credits or accounts receivable in greater numbers than we expect  additional allowances may be required 
during the second quarter of  we refined our methodology used to estimate losses in dining credits and accounts receivable 
prior to the second quarter of  our methodology was primarily based upon the age of the portfolio as calculated from sales from the preceding quarter 
we applied estimated loss percentages to the aged portfolio based on the estimated time remaining on each deal 
we also provided for specifically identified accounts and for dining credits balances that were large or slow moving 
since the beginning of  however  we have been collecting additional historical information on merchant account balances 
with this additional data  during the second quarter of  we refined our estimation method and now use this information to monitor accounts  track historical write offs  and fund new accounts 
we now apply a reserve rate to accounts based upon additional characteristics  such as whether the account has been referred for legal collection  the date of the last payment received from the merchant  whether our attempt to debit the merchant s bank account for payments due to us has been rejected  the merchant s commercial credit score  and the aging of the account 
the reserve rate for each account is based upon historical charge off rates of accounts with similar characteristics 
we also provide for specifically identified accounts and for dining credit balances that are large or slow moving as we did previously 
we will continue to review our reserve rates on a regular basis based upon 
table of contents historical charge off rates and may adjust reserve rates based on changes in the nature of our business  risk considerations  economic conditions or other factors 
losses are reduced by recoveries of dining credits previously charged off 
account balances are charged off against the allowance once we conclude that a merchant is unwilling or unable to honor their obligation relating to dining credits 
subsequent to the account being charged off  we may continue to pursue recovery efforts 
as of the beginning of  we updated our write off policy to further define when an account should be written off 
this updated policy contributed to higher write offs in as compared with in march  we began to provide access to capital through a loan product  called rcr loans 
we discontinued offering the product line effective january  although we continue to service rcr loan notes that we previously purchased 
we provide an allowance for our rcr loan product using a specific reserve method based on the merchant s payment history and previous experience with the merchant  if applicable 
we purchased rcr loan notes from webbank after webbank originated and funded the rcr loan 
if an rcr loan merchant fails  we may not realize any value for the rcr loan note that we purchased 
even if an rcr loan merchant stays in business  it may fail to repay the note that we purchased and we may incur costs to collect on the note and may not recover amounts sufficient to compensate us for damages that we suffer 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is not likely to be recognized due to cumulative losses and the uncertainty as to future recoverability 
we consider future taxable income and available tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made 
goodwill impairment on at least an annual basis  we evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant the recognition of an impairment loss of unamortized goodwill 
if it is determined that a triggering event has occurred  we evaluate goodwill for impairment between our annual testing dates 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a significant  sustained negative trend in our operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand for our programs  a change in the competitive environment  a decline in the market value of our company and other industry and economic factors 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future cash flows 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis in our impairment testing 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results that are used in the preparation of projected cash flows  and  if different conditions prevail or judgments are made  a material write down of goodwill could occur 
we comply with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the current standard for periodic assessment of the carrying value of intangible assets  including goodwill 
we assess the impact of sfas no 
using a two step approach to assess goodwill based on applicable reporting units and any intangible assets  including goodwill  recorded in connection with our previous acquisitions 
we report under a single reporting segment as such our goodwill analysis is measured under one reporting unit 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the marketing credits program and marketing services program when members patronize participating merchants and pay using a payment card they have registered with us 
revenue is recognized only if the member s transaction qualifies for a benefit in accordance with the rules of the 
table of contents member s particular program 
the amount of revenue recognized is that portion of the member s total transaction amount that we are entitled to receive in cash  in accordance with the terms of our agreement with the participating merchant 
for example  if a member s total qualified transaction amount is at a participating merchant  as evidenced by the full amount of the payment card transaction  and our contract provides for us to receive  the amount of revenue we recognize is  representing what we actually realize in cash 
similarly  under the typical marketing services program contract  we recognize revenue only to the extent that we are contractually entitled to receive cash for a portion of the member s total qualified transaction amount 
the same transaction referred to above at a marketing services program merchant may yield in revenue to be recognized 
under the rcr loan product  we recognize interest income on an effective yield basis over the life of the loan 
legal contingencies we review the status of significant legal matters and assess our potential financial exposure with respect to such legal matters on at least a quarterly basis 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and legal proceedings and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

table of contents operating revenues the following table sets forth for the periods presented sales  components of costs of sales and certain other information for each of our two marketing programs 
we use the term dining credits to refer to the portion of future member transactions that we purchase 
our marketing credits program contracts include a fee for marketing  customer feedback through member comments and ratings  member feedback and dining rewards programs 
we include all components of the marketing credits program  including this fee  in marketing credits program sales and revenues because we analyze our business in this manner 
we use the term merchant in this discussion to refer to restaurants  bars and clubs 
financial information regarding our interest income from the rcr loan product is included in the marketing credits program sales strictly for purposes of our income statement 
marketing credits program marketing services program total marketing credits program marketing services program total merchant count as of december  and  respectively number of qualified transactions average transaction amount qualified transaction amount sales yield sales cost of dining credits processing fee total cost of sales provision for dining credits losses member benefits bonus rewards partner commissions total member benefits net revenue in analyzing sales  we focus on three key metrics merchant count  qualified transaction amount  and sales yield 
merchant count is the number of merchants active in our program at the end of each period 
qualified transaction amount represents the total dollar value of all member dining transactions that qualify for a benefit  and therefore provide revenue to us 
sales yield represents the percentage of the qualified transaction amount that we retain as revenue 
ending merchant count as of december  was  compared to  as of december   an increase of 
the increase in total merchant count was driven by a increase in marketing services program merchants to  merchants  offset by a decrease in marketing credits program merchants to  merchants 
the increase in merchant count was a result of the staffing level and productivity of our sales force throughout and in addition  we experienced a shift in the mix of merchants towards marketing services program merchants from marketing credits program merchants as a result of more conservative dining credits purchase policies implemented during our more conservative dining credits purchasing policies caused some merchants to complete the program more quickly than in the past that we were unable to renew caused us to reject more deals than in the past  and caused some merchants to reject our dining credits purchase offers as being insufficient for their needs 
we continually evaluate our dining credits purchase policies by monitoring the performance of our dining credits portfolio and observing current economic trends facing the restaurant industry 
during  we made 
table of contents efforts to retain desirable merchants by increasing  on a risk adjusted basis  the amount of dining credits that we purchased  and lengthened the period of time it takes our members to use the dining credits at the restaurants 
the longer dining credits usage periods from these deals contributed to an increase in our dining credits portfolio balance and merchant count throughout during the fourth quarter of and throughout  we began to shorten the dining credits usage period of new dining credits purchased from certain merchants as a result of our assessment of the overall economic trends facing the restaurant industry  a decline in consumer spending and the pending repurchase of our  convertible subordinated debentures that were due in october shortening the dining credits usage period for a deal reduces our risk exposure with respect to that deal  but also decreases the revenue that we may realize from that deal and may shorten the period of time the restaurant participates in our program if we are unable to renew the restaurant s participation in our programs 
our net dining credits balance as of december  decreased to  from  at december  due in part to the decrease in the dining credits net usage period 
qualified transaction amounts at our participating merchants increased  or  to  for compared to as a result of the increase in merchant count and in the number of qualified transactions between periods 
the increase in overall merchant count combined with increased spending at lower priced merchants drove an increase in the number of qualified transactions for as compared to however  this volume increase was significantly offset by a decrease in average transaction amount 
average transaction amount decreased  or  to for from for while we saw members continue to dine out despite the difficult economic climate they generally spent less than they have in the past and also shifted their dining habits from higher end establishments toward mid and low range establishments 
as noted above  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we shortened usage periods of new marketing credits deals  which resulted in a higher cost of sales 
in order to maintain profitability of marketing credits deals that have a higher cost of sales  we require a higher sales yield on these transactions 
as a result  total sales yield increased to for compared to for due to the increase in sales yield in the marketing credits program  offset by a decrease in sales yield in the marketing services program 
the marketing credits program sales yield increased to for compared to for sales yield for the marketing services program decreased to for from for as we have continued to lower the price of this product 
sales for increased as compared with primarily due to an increase in merchant count  increase in qualified transaction amount and higher marketing credits sales yield  offset by lower average transaction amount 
marketing credits sales increased for as compared to while marketing services program sales decreased slightly 
cost of sales increased to of total sales and of marketing credit program sales for as compared to of total sales and of marketing credit program sales for the same period in the prior year 
this increase was due to our effort  beginning in the fourth quarter of  to shorten usage periods of new marketing credits deals 
marketing credits deals with shorter usage periods typically have a higher cost of sales because we purchase dining credits with a shorter usage period at a lower discount 
the dining credits net usage period decreased to months at the end of from months at the end of the provision for losses decreased slightly to of total sales and of marketing credits program sales for compared with of total sales and of marketing credits program sales for as previously discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates  we refined our methodology used to estimate losses in dining credits and accounts receivable 
the refined methodology was applied to our entire portfolio and resulted in approximately  of additional provision for losses expense during the second quarter of the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the gross dining credits balance was as of december  as compared to as of december  while we have adopted more conservative dining credits purchasing policies  we have also increased our reserves against the dining credits portfolio 
we believe that the higher reserve balance is appropriate given the increased risk of merchant defaults due to the economic uncertainty 

table of contents the provision for both periods included reserves for both our dining credits portfolio and rcr loan notes 
the provision for losses expense for rcr loan notes was and  for and  respectively 
we decided to exit the rcr loan product effective january  although we continue to service rcr loan notes that we previously purchased 
the rcr loan notes receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was net write offs totaled  during as compared to net write offs of during in early  we updated our write off policy to further define when an account should be written off 
as a result of this updated policy  there was a slower write off of assets in the gross dining credits asset and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts during as of the beginning of  we further refined the write off policy to include a time period in which an account should be written off 
due in part to this updated policy we recognized higher write offs in as compared with the prior year 
because the majority of these write offs were previously reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts  the change in this policy did not materially affect the provision for losses during member benefits expense  which includes partner commissions and incentive bonus awards paid to members  decreased to  or of sales  for compared with  or of sales  for we implemented revised benefit offerings with most of our partners that went into effect during the first quarter of these revised offerings resulted in lower overall member benefit costs 
during we drove increases in qualified transactions  active members and overall revenues while decreasing total member benefits expense by  compared to the prior year 
offsetting this cost savings was an expense of  recorded during relating to our minimum purchase obligations with various partners 
there was no such expense during the prior year 
net revenues increased to  or of sales  during as compared to  or of sales  during net revenues were positively impacted as compared to the prior period by higher sales and lower member benefits expense  partially offset by increases in cost of sales and the provision for losses 
membership and other income decreased or for compared with the decrease can be primarily attributed to the decline in fee paying members 
beginning in mid  we introduced a new membership program that eliminates fees for certain members 
operating expenses salaries and benefits increased  or to  for from  for primarily due to an increase in management incentive compensation accruals and an increase in stock based compensation expense from the issuance of restricted stock unit awards  offset by a decrease in salary expense from a reduction in general and administrative headcount 
sales commissions and expenses include sales force salaries and benefits  commissions  travel costs and training 
sales commissions and expenses decreased to of sales for compared to of sales for due to a decrease in sales employee headcount  primarily in connection with the discontinuation of the rcr loan program  partially offset by an increase in the sales incentive compensation expense 
professional fees increased  or  to  for as compared to  for as a result of the expansion efforts in canada and professional fees related to collections efforts 
member and merchant marketing expenses decreased  or for compared with as we continue to migrate our marketing efforts away from direct print mail and focus on more cost efficient email marketing 
while our marketing expenses have decreased by nearly half  we continue to see increases in total revenues  total qualified transactions and active members compared with the prior year 

table of contents depreciation and amortization costs increased or for compared to as we continue to invest in the development of our websites  technology investments supporting the automation of internal processes  and general information technology investments 
general and administrative expenses decreased or for compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rent expense  other office costs  corporate insurance expense and travel expenses  offset by increases in stock compensation expense of due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units for our board of directors during the first quarter of and severance expense of related to a reduction in force 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k  during we reversed in litigation and related expenses relating to the california class action lawsuit 
in we reversed  in litigation and related expenses which consisted of  relating to the california class action lawsuit and relating to the source inc litigation 
the expenses related to the california class action suit consisted of the expense to the class  legal expenses incurred by us  legal expenses from the plaintiff s attorneys  claims administration costs and class representation costs 
the original reserve recorded in was based on our initial estimate of the cost of the settlement and related legal and administrative expenses 
the first installment for virtually all of the claims  payments to the representative plaintiffs and the first installment of payments to class counsel were made in december as such  the reserve was adjusted during and as the actual amounts were determined 
the balance of the accrual relating to the california class action suit was  as of december  and will be paid during the first quarter of other income and expense interest and other income decreased  to for compared with as a result of lower cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of the repurchase of our convertible subordinated debentures during and a change in investment strategy  which resulted in lower interest rates year over year 
interest expense and financing costs decreased  to  primarily due to a decrease in interest expense recorded for our convertible subordinated debentures as a result of our purchase of the outstanding convertible subordinated debentures beginning in late in addition  we recorded a gain of in and a gain of in relating to the purchase of a portion of our outstanding convertible subordinate debentures as discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
income tax provision our effective tax rate for was compared with for the increase primarily resulted from a higher level of tax exempt interest recorded in as compared to net income net income was  for compared with net income of  for the results included a reversal of litigation and related expenses relating to the california class action suit of  pre tax

the increase in total merchant count was driven by a increase in marketing services program merchants to  merchants and a increase in marketing credits program merchants to  merchants 
average overall merchant count  defined as the average number of merchants active on the program over a given period  was  for compared to  for  a decrease of 
the decrease in the overall average merchant count was driven by a decrease in average marketing credits program merchants to  merchants  partially offset by a increase in average marketing services program merchants to  merchants 
the decrease in the average number of marketing credits program merchants for as compared to was due in part to our revised dining credits purchasing policies  which led to the removal of undesirable and unprofitable merchants from our dining credits portfolio 
the decrease was also due in part to merchants that we otherwise desired to retain in our program that either would not agree to terms of a new deal that reflected our revised dining credits purchasing policies or no longer desired to participate in our program 
finally  the revised purchasing policies resulted in a shorter usage period in the portfolio during  which accelerated the renewal cycle of the portfolio 
with an adequately staffed sales force through  our goal was to continue to grow the marketing credits program merchant count during that period without compromising the quality of the merchants in the portfolio or the profitability of deals by demonstrating the value of our services 
we made efforts to retain desirable merchants by increasing  on a risk adjusted basis  the amount of future member transactions that we purchased from them in order for them to remain in our program for a longer period of time 
our marketing credits program merchant count increased throughout as a result of this increase in merchant count and our purchase of more future member transactions from selected merchants  beginning in the first quarter of our net dining credits portfolio balance increased and our dining credits usage period lengthened 
we continually evaluate our dining credits purchase policies by monitoring the performance of our portfolio and observing current economic trends facing the restaurant industry 
during the later part of  we began shortening the dining credits usage period on new dining credits entering the portfolio 
we shorten the 
table of contents dining credits usage period by purchasing fewer dining credits  which reduces the size of our dining credits portfolio 
purchasing fewer dining credits reduces our risk exposure with respect to those deals  but also decreases the total revenue that we may realize from that deal and shortens the period of time the restaurant participates in our program if we are unable to renew the restaurant 
qualified transaction amounts at our participating merchants decreased  or  to  for compared to qualified transaction amount in the marketing credits program decreased primarily because of a decline in member activity  the management of our members share of individual restaurants business and a decline in the number of average marketing credits program merchants 
qualified transaction amount in our marketing services program increased at a slower rate than the marketing services program merchant count 
marketing services program merchant count increased as of december  as compared to december  while marketing services qualified transaction amount increased during as compared to marketing services qualified transaction amount increase was lower than the merchant count increase mainly due to a decrease in member activity and the management of our members share of individual restaurants business
