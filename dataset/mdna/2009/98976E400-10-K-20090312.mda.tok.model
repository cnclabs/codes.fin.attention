item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
readers should also be cautioned that results of any reported period are often not indicative of results for any future period 
potential share exchange on january   zoom entered into a share exchange agreement the agreement with tianjin tong guang group digital communication co  ltd tcb digital and tcb digital s majority shareholder  gold lion holding limited gold lion 
tcb digital is primarily engaged in electronic and telecommunications product design  development and manufacturing 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  zoom intends to acquire from gold lion of the outstanding stock of tcb digital in exchange for  shares of zoom common stock 
in addition  zoom intends to grant the majority shareholder of gold lion an option to acquire an additional  zoom shares in exchange for an additional of the outstanding stock of tcb digital 
if the option is exercised  zoom would have acquired of the outstanding stock of tcb digital in exchange for an aggregate of  shares of zoom common stock 
zoom will also have options to acquire five other companies that are owned by the majority shareholder of gold lion  with the option price of each company to be based on the higher of a minimum price or a multiple of that company s net income 
at the closing of the share exchange pursuant to the agreement  zoom intends to spin off its current business and operating subsidiary  zoom telephonics  in a transaction that is not anticipated to be a taxable distribution to zoom s shareholders 
zoom telephonics would also grant tcb digital licensing rights to the zoom and hayes trademarks for certain products and geographic regions 
the potential transaction is described in zoom s current report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on february  the potential transaction is subject to approval by zoom s shareholders as well as the satisfaction or waiver of other conditions 
if the transaction closes  zoom s shareholders immediately prior to the closing date would retain their existing shares in zoom technologies and would also receive an equal number of new shares in zoom telephonics  inc overview we derive our net sales primarily from sales of internet related communication products  principally broadband and dial up modems and other communication products  to retailers  distributors  internet service providers and original equipment manufacturers 
we sell our products through a direct sales force and through independent sales agents 
our employees are primarily located at our headquarters in boston  massachusetts and our sales office in the united kingdom 
we are experienced in electronics hardware  firmware  and software design and test  regulatory approvals  product documentation  and packaging  and we use that experience in developing each product in house or in partnership with suppliers who are typically based in asia 
electronic assembly and testing of the company s products in accordance with our specifications is typically done in china 
for many years we performed most of the final assembly  test  packaging  warehousing and distribution at a production and warehouse facility on summer street in boston  massachusetts  which has also engaged in firmware programming for some products 
on june  we announced our plans to move most of our summer street operations to a dedicated facility in tijuana  mexico commencing approximately september   and we have since implemented that plan 
our lease for our summer street facility expired in august  and we completely vacated the facility on september  our mexican lease expires april   and we hope to reduce our leased space and cost starting may  since our headquarters has been near south station in downtown boston 
zoom historically owned two adjacent buildings which connect on most floors  and which house our entire boston staff 
in december we sold our headquarters buildings to a third party  with a two year lease back of approximately  square feet of the  square foot facility 
our net sale proceeds were approximately million of which approximately million was repaid to our mortgage holder  eliminating the mortgage debt from our balance sheet 
our current lease expired in december  and we recently signed a lease extension that commits us for at least years 
on january  we reduced our leased boston space from  square feet to  square feet with an increase in rent per square foot  resulting in a savings in of for many years we derived a majority of our net sales from the retail after market sale of dial up modems to customers seeking to add or upgrade a modem for their personal computers 
in recent years the size of this market and our sales to this market have declined  as personal computer manufacturers have incorporated a modem as a built in component in most consumer personal computers and as increasing numbers of consumers world wide have switched to broadband internet access 
the consensus of communications industry analysts is that after market sales of dial up modems will probably continue to decline 
there is also consensus among industry analysts that the installed base for broadband internet connection devices  such as cable modems and dsl modems  will grow rapidly during the decade 
in response to increased and forecasted worldwide demand for faster connection speeds and increased modem functionality  we have invested and continue to invest resources to advance our product line of broadband modems  both dsl modems and cable modems 
we continually seek to improve our product designs and manufacturing approach in order to improve product performance and reduce our costs 
we pursue a strategy of outsourcing rather than internally developing our modem chipsets  which are application specific integrated circuits that form the technology base for our modems 
by outsourcing the chipset technology  we are able to concentrate our research and development resources on modem system design  leverage the extensive research and development capabilities of our chipset suppliers  and reduce our development time and associated costs and risks 
as a result of this approach  we are able to quickly develop new products while maintaining a relatively low level of research and development expense as a percentage of net sales 
we also outsource aspects of our manufacturing to contract manufacturers as a means of reducing our costs of production  and to provide us with great er flexibility in our production capacity 
generally our gross margin for a given product depends on a number of factors including the type of customer to whom we are selling 
the gross margin for retailers tends to be higher than for some of our other customers  but the sales  support  returns  and overhead costs associated with retailers also tend to be higher 
zoom s sales to certain countries are currently handled by a single master distributor for each country who handles the support and marketing costs within the country 
gross margin for sales to these master distributors tends to be low  since lower pricing to these distributors helps them to cover the support and marketing costs for their country 
in our net sales were down compared to the sales decline was mainly the result of decreases in dsl dial up  and cable modem sales which were partially offset by an increase in wireless product sales 
because of our significant customer concentration our net sales and operating results have fluctuated and in the future could continue to fluctuate significantly due to changes in political or economic conditions or the loss  reduction of business  or less favorable terms for any of our significant customers 
over the past several years our net sales have declined 
in response to declining sales volume  we have cut costs by reducing staffing and some overhead costs 
our total headcount of full time employees  including temporary workers  was reduced from on september  to on december  as of february  zoom had full time and part time employees 
of the zoom employees on february  were engaged in research and development  were involved in manufacturing oversight  purchasing  assembly  packaging  shipping and quality control  were engaged in sales  marketing and technical support  and the remaining performed accounting  administrative  management information systems  and executive functions 
zoom has implemented cost cutting measures including reducing our headcount and reducing certain employees work week from hours to hours per week 
as a result  zoom cu rrently has full time employees and part time employees those working less than hours per week 
our dedicated manufacturing personnel in mexico are employees of our mexican manufacturing service provider and not included in our or headcount 
during the quarter ended september  we purchased all the series a preferred shares the series a shares of unity business networks  llc unity for cash of million  including transaction costs 
the series a shares are convertible at any time at our option into of unity s common stock on a fully diluted basis 
the series a shares convert automatically if unity consummates a public offering with gross proceeds in excess of million or days after unity delivers its audited financial statements to the company 
in addition  we have an option to purchase all the outstanding common stock of unity based on a specified multiple of unity s revenues  as defined 
at december  zoom determined that the fair market value of its investment in unity was million which resulted in a write down of million of the originally capitalized million 
a transaction for the sale of unity to a third party has been under evaluation since december and has a mid year target close date 
if and when this sale closes  zoom should recover million of the million asset value capitalized during the quarter ended september  and carried on the balance sheet at december  if the sale does not take place zoom believes the million value is the appropriate estimate of fair market value at december  as a result  zoom has written down the million asset value to million at december  on january   zoom and redmoon  inc  a provider of wireless networks headquartered in plano  texas redmoon  entered into a convertible note purchase agreement pursuant to which the company made an initial investment of  in convertible notes the notes and agreed to purchase an additional  per month of convertible notes beginning on may  and continuing until the earlier of i the company s election to exercise its option to purchase all outstanding stock of redmoon or ii the company s election to terminate such option up to a maximum total investment of  on april  the company notified redmoon of the company s decision not to invest  on may  the option to purchase all of redmoon s outstanding stock was not exercised and terminated in accordance with its terms on august  at december  zoom determined that the fair market value of its investment in redmoon was zero due to redmoon s working capital position  cash flow  and our analysis of the recovery value of the assets 
accordingly  zoom wrote off of the million asset value  including transaction costs of million 
on december  we had working capital of million including million in cash and cash equivalents 
on december  we had working capital of million including million in cash and cash equivalents 
our current ratio at december  was compared to at december  a significant portion in the reduction of the current ratio was due to the cash decline 
in the company s operating activities used million in cash 
its net loss in was million 
after adjusting for non cash items including the million gain on sale of real estate  the million write down of unity and redmoon  million of depreciation and amortization expense  million of stock based compensation and million reversal of allowances  sources of cash from operations included a decrease in inventories of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease of million of prepaid expense and other current assets 
uses of cash from operations included a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expense of million 
in the company s net cash used in investing activities was million for our investment in redmoon 
on june  the stockholders of the company approved a reverse stock split within the range of one for two and one for nine 
on july   the board of directors approved a one for five reverse stock split which became effective on august  all common stock information prior to august  and presented herein has been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split 
critical accounting policies and estimates following is a discussion of what we view as our more significant accounting policies and estimates 
as described below  management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified areas where material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net sales  costs  and expenses for any period if we had made different judgments or used different estimates 
revenue net sales recognition 
we primarily sell hardware products to our customers 
the hardware products include dial up modems  dsl modems  cable modems  voice over ip products  and wireless and wired networking equipment 
we earn a small amount of royalty revenue that is included in our net sales  primarily from internet service providers 
we generally do not sell software 
we began selling services in we introduced our global village voip service in late  but sales of those services to date have not been material 
we derive our net sales primarily from the sales of hardware products to four types of customers computer peripherals retailers  computer product distributors  internet service providers  and original equipment manufacturers oems we recognize hardware net sales for our customers at the point when the customers take legal ownership of the delivered products 
legal ownership passes from zoom to the customer based on the contractual fob point specified in signed contracts and purchase orders  which are both used extensively 
many of our customer contracts or purchase orders specify fob destination 
we verify the delivery date on all significant fob destination shipments made during the last business days of each quarter 
our net sales of hardware include reductions resulting from certain events which are characteristic of the sales of hardware to retailers of computer peripherals 
these events are product returns  certain sales and marketing incentives  price protection refunds  and consumer mail in and in store rebates 
each of these is accounted for as a reduction of net sales based on detailed management estimates  which are reconciled to actual customer or end consumer credits on a monthly or quarterly basis 
our voip service revenues were recorded as the end user customer consumed billable voip services 
the end user customer became a service customer by electing to sign up for the global village billable service on the internet 
zoom recorded revenue either when billable services were consumed or when a monthly flat fee service was billed 
product returns 
products are returned by retail stores and distributors for inventory balancing  contractual stock rotation privileges  and warranty repair or replacements 
we estimate the sales and cost value of expected future product returns of previously sold products 
our estimates for product returns are based on recent historical trends plus estimates for returns prompted by  among other things  announced stock rotations and announced customer store closings 
management reviews historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when estimating sales return allowances 
the estimate for future returns is recorded as a reserve against accounts receivable  a reduction in our net sales  and the corresponding change to inventory reserves and cost of sales 
product returns as a percentage of total shipments were and  respectively  for and nbs p  price protection refunds 
we have a policy of offering price protection to certain of our retailer and distributor customers for some or all their inventory 
under the price protection policies  when we reduce our prices for a product  the customer receives a credit for the difference between the original purchase price and our reduced price for their unsold inventory of that product 
our estimates for price protection refunds are based on a detailed understanding and tracking by customer and by sales program 
estimated price protection refunds are recorded in the same period as the announcement of a pricing change 
information from customer inventory on hand reports or from direct communications with the customers is used to estimate the refund  which is recorded as a reduction of net sales and a reserve against accounts receivable 
reductions in our net sales due to price protection were million in and million in sales and marketing incentives 
many of our retailer customers require sales and marketing support funding  usually set as a percentage of our sales in their stores 
the incentives were reported as reductions in our net sales and were million in and million in consumer mail in and in store rebates 
our estimates for consumer mail in and in store rebates are based on a detailed understanding and tracking by customer and sales program  supported by actual rebate claims processed by the rebate redemption centers plus an accrual for an estimated lag in processing at the redemption centers 
the estimate for mail in and in store rebates is recorded as a reserve against accounts receivable and a reduction of net sales in the same period that the rebate obligation was triggered 
reductions in our net sales due to the consumer rebates were million in and million in to ensure that the sales  discounts  and marketing incentives are recorded in the proper period  we perform extensive tracking and documenting by customer  by period  and by type of marketing event 
this tracking includes reconciliation to the accounts receivable records for deductions taken by our customers for these discounts and incentives 
accounts receivable valuation 
we establish accounts receivable valuation allowances equal to the above discussed net sales adjustments for estimates of product returns  price protection refunds  consumer rebates  and general bad debt reserves 
these allowances are reduced as actual credits are issued to the customer s accounts 
our bad debt write offs were less than million for and million for inventory valuation and cost of goods sold 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost  determined by the first in  first out method  or market 
we review inventories for obsolete slow moving products each quarter and make provisions based on our estimate of the probability that the material will not be consumed or that it will be sold below cost 
in and we recorded an additional charge of million and million  respectively for inventory reserves related to obsolete and slow moving products 
valuation and impairment of deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income tax expense and deferred income tax position 
this process involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
changes in the valuation allowance are reflected in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowances 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets 
it is management s estimate that  after considering all the available objective evidence  historical and prospective  with greater weight given to historical evidence  it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized 
if we establish a record of continuing profitability  at some point we will be required to reduce the valuation allowance and recognize an equal income tax benefit which will increase net income in that period s 
as of december  we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  these federal net operating losses are available to offset future taxable income  and are due to expire in years ranging from to we also had state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  these state net operating losses are available to offset future taxable income  and are primarily due to expire in years ranging from to valuation of investments 
during the quarter ended september  the company purchased all the series a preferred shares the series a shares of unity business networks  llc unity for million in cash  including transaction costs 
the series a shares are convertible at any time at the company s option into of unity s common stock on a fully diluted basis 
the series a shares convert automatically if unity consummates a public offering with gross proceeds in excess of million or days after unity delivers its audited financial statements to the company 
in addition  the company has an option to purchase all the outstanding common stock of unity based on a specified multiple of unity s revenues  as defined  for the option is exercisable for days following the receipt of unity s audited financial statements 
the company s ceo is a member of unity s five member board of directors 
further  the company is entitled to vote series a shares on an as converted basis with unity s common stock 
the company is unable to exercise significant influence over unity s policies or operations 
a transaction for the sale of unity to a third party has been under evaluation since december and has a mid year target close date 
if and when this sale closes  zoom should recover million of the million asset value capitalized during the quarter ended september  and carried on the balance sheet at december  if the sale does not take place zoom believes the million value is the appropriate estimate of fair market value at december  as a result  zoom has written down the million asset value to million at december  on january  zoom and redmoon  inc  a provider of wireless networks headquartered in plano  texas redmoon  entered into a convertible note purchase agreement pursuant to which we made an initial investment of  in convertible notes the notes and agreed to purchase an additional  per month of convertible notes beginning on may  and continuing until the earlier of i the company s election to exercise the option to purchase all outstanding stock of redmoon contained in the option agreement described in note to the accompanying financial statements or ii the company s election to terminate such option agreement  up to a maximum total investment of  on april  the company notified redmoon of the company s decision not to invest  on may  the option to purchase all of redmoon s outstanding sto ck was not exercised and terminated in accordance with its terms on august  at december  zoom determined that the fair market value of its investment in redmoon was zero due to zoom s assessment of the fair market value of the current and fixed assets  liabilities  and our analysis of the recovery value of the asset 
accordingly  zoom recorded a write off of the redmoon investment asset in the amount of million  which amount included transaction costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expense selling general and administration research and development total operating expenses operating profit loss before sale of real estate gain on sale of real estate operating profit loss other income expense other  net total other income expense loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following is a discussion of the major categories of our consolidated statement of operations  comparing the financial results for the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales 
our total net sales decreased year over year by million or 
in and we primarily generated our sales by selling dial up and broadband modems via retailers  distributors  and internet service providers 
the dial up modem market has continued to decline 
zoom sales of dial up modems declined million due primarily to the decline of the dial up modem market 
our broadband  wireless and other products sales decreased year over year by million or 
year sales year sales change change dial up broadband  wireless and other products total net sales as shown in the table below our net sales in north america decreased million or from million in to million in our net sales in the uk were million in compared to million in  a decrease 
the sales declines in north america and the uk primarily reflect decreased sales of broadband modems in our retailer channel as compared to in our new and existing large retailer customers purchased inventories of dsl modems to support forecasted sales volumes which were not realized 
additionally there was a more modest decline of dial up modem sales at retailers in the us and the us our net sales in all other countries were million in compared to million in  a decline 
the sales decline in all other countries was primarily due to declining sales of dsl modems and dial up modems 
year sales year sales change change north america uk all other total net sales during two customers each accounted for or more of our total net sales 
together these two customers accounted for of our total net sales 
during  three customers accounted for more than of our total net sales 
together these three customers accounted for of our total net sales 
because of our customer concentration  our net sales and operating income could fluctuate significantly due to changes in political or economic conditions or the loss  reduction of business  or less favorable terms for any of our significant customers 
gross profit 
our gross profit was million in compared to million in our gross profit percentage of net sales increased to in from in the primary reason for this increase was lower sales dilution from consumer rebates and other retail channel payments and lower manufacturing expense 
operating expense 
total operating expense excluding the gain on sale of real estate decreased by million from million in to million in total operating expense excluding the gain on sale of real estate as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in the table below illustrates the change in operating expense 
operating expense year sales net sales year sales net sales change change selling expense general and administrative expense research and development expense total operating expense excluding the gain on sale of real estate selling expense 
selling expense decreased from million in to million in selling expense as a percentage of net sales was in and in the million reduction in selling expense was primarily due to reduced product delivery and warehousing costs  sales commissions  and personnel costs due to lower employee headcount 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in and million in general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was in and in in compared to  general and administrative expense decreased million primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs million and numerous other cost categories  partially offset by an increase in legal  audit and consulting fees million in support of efforts to finalize an acquisition transaction 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased from million in to million in research and development expense as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in the million decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to reduced personnel costs 
gain on sale of real estate 
in we sold the real estate housing our corporate headquarters and concurrently entered into a leaseback arrangement for a portion of the property 
the leaseback arrangement was for two years 
a gain of million was realized on the sale 
however  a portion of the gain million was deferred and has been recognized in operations over the term of the lease million in and million in 
the deferred gain was the estimated present value of the minimum lease payments under the leaseback arrangement 
the final monthly deferred gain was recorded in december other income expense 
other income  net decreased from million in to a loss of million in the primary reasons for the drop of million was the million write down of investment assets  reduced interest income  and higher foreign exchange losses 
income tax expense benefit 
we recorded a million net income tax expense in resulting from our income tax in mexico 
we did not recognize any income tax in liquidity and capital resources on december  we had working capital of million including million in cash and cash equivalents 
on december  we had working capital of million including million in cash and cash equivalents 
our current ratio at december  was compared to at december  a significant portion in the reduction of the current ratio was due to the cash decline 
in the company s operating activities used million in cash 
its net loss in was million 
after adjusting for non cash items including the million gain on sale of real estate  the million write down of unity and redmoon  million of depreciation and amortization expense  million of stock based compensation and the million reversal of allowances  sources of cash from operations included a decrease in inventories of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease of million of prepaid expense and other current assets 
uses of cash from operations included a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expense of million 
in the company s net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily for its investment in redmoon 
to conserve cash and manage our liquidity  we have implemented cost cutting initiatives including the reduction of employee headcount and overhead costs 
as of december  we had full time employees compared to as of december  as of february  we had full time employees and part time employees 
we plan to continue to assess our cost structure as it relates to our revenues and cash position  and we may make further reductions if the actions are deemed necessary 
in the company incurred a net loss of million and used cash in operating activities of million 
these and other conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management does not believe we have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations over the next months unless sales improve significantly or we raise capital 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
if these funds are not available the company may not be able to execute its business plan or take advantage of business opportunities 
the ability of the company to obtain such additional financing and to achieve its operating goals is uncertain 
in the event that the company does not obtain additional capital or is not able to increase cash flow through the increase of sales  there is substantial doubt as to it s ability to continue as a going concern see risk factors below  for further information with respect to events and uncertainties that could harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
risks associated with potential share exchange for additional information with respect to the potential share exchange with tcb digital  see item business 
a significant delay in consummating or a failure to consummate the proposed share exchange with tcb digital could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and operating results 
if the proposed share exchange with tcb digital is not completed  it could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
in addition  any significant delay in consummating the transaction could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  adversely affect our customer relationships and would likely lead to significant diversion of management and employee attention and potential attrition of key employees 
restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the proposed share exchange with tcb digital may have a negative impact on our operating results 
we have agreed to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business in connection with the proposed share exchange with tcb digital  that require us to conduct our business only in the ordinary course  subject to specific limitations 
these restrictions may delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the transaction 
risks associated with our business to stay in business we will likely require additional funding  which we may be unable to obtain on favorable terms  if at all 
over the next twelve months we will likely require additional financing to fund our operations 
we have no line of credit from which we can borrow 
additional financing may not be available to us on a timely basis if at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing when needed  we may not have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  contains a explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
this indicates there is substantial doubt on the part of our independent registered public accounting firm as to our ability to continue as a going concern due to the risk that we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets at december  to cover our operating and capital requirements for the next twelve month period and if sufficient cash cannot be obtained we would have to substantially alter our operations  or we may be forced to discontinue operations 
such an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm may limit our ability to access certain types of financing the market for high speed communications products and services has many competing technologies and  as a result  the demand for certain of our products and services is declining 
industry analysts believe that the market for our dial up modems will continue to decline 
if we are unable to increase demand for and sales of our broadband modems  we may be unable to sustain or grow our business 
the market for high speed communications products and services has a number of competing technologies 
for instance  internet access can be achieved by using a standard telephone line and appropriate service for dial up modems  dsl modems  using a cable modem with a cable tv line and cable modem service  using a router and some type of modem to service the computers connected to a local area network  or other approaches  including wireless links to the internet 
although we currently sell products that include these technologies  our most successful products have historically been our dial up modems 
the introduction of new products by competitors  market acceptance of competing products based on new or alternative technologies  or the emergence of new industry standards have in the past rendered and could continue to render our products less competitive or even obsolete 
for example  these factors have caused the market for our dial up modems to shrink dramatically 
if we are unable to increase demand for our broadband modems  we may be unable to sustain or grow our business 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market if we are unable to satisfy the minimum bid price requirements 
our common stock is currently listed for quotation on the nasdaq capital market 
we are required to meet certain financial requirements in order to maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market 
one such requirement is that we maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least per share for our common stock 
the nasdaq stock market has suspended the minimum bid price requirement until april   however  our common stock is currently trading near or below per share 
if our common stock trades below per share for consecutive business days after the expiration of the temporary suspension  we will receive a deficiency notice from nasdaq advising us that we have days to regain compliance by maintaining a minimum bid price of at least for a minimum of ten consecutive business days 
if we fail to satisfy the nasdaq capital market s continued listing requirements  our common stock could be del isted from the nasdaq capital market 
any potential delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq capital market would make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our stock in the public market and would likely result in decreased liquidity and have a negative effect on the market price for our shares 
our reliance on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenues could materially harm our business and prospects 
relatively few customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the company s net sales 
during two customers each accounted for or more of our total net sales 
together these two customers accounted for of our total net sales 
our customers generally do not enter into long term agreements obligating them to purchase our products 
we may not continue to receive significant revenues from any of these or from other large customers 
because of our significant customer concentration  our net sales and operating income could fluctuate significantly due to changes in political or economic conditions or the loss of  reduction of business with  or less favorable terms for any of our significant customers 
a reduction or delay in orders from any of our significant customers  or a delay or default in payment by any significant customer could materially harm our business  results of operation and liquidity 
our reliance on a single manufacturer and a single supplier of a critical component for a substantial percentage of our products could have an adverse effect on our business 
we currently rely on a single manufacturer to manufacture a substantial portion of our products 
we also currently rely on a sole sourced chipset as the most critical component of most of our products 
the loss of the services of this manufacturer or the components supplied by this supplier or an adverse change in the manufacturer s or supplier s business or our relationship could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our products and on our business 
fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
changes in currency exchange rates that increase the relative value of the us dollar may make it more difficult for us to compete with foreign manufacturers on price  may reduce our foreign currency denominated sales when expressed in dollars  or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
a significant increase in our foreign currency denominated sales would increase our risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
a weakness in the us dollar relative to the mexican peso and various asian currencies including the chinese renminbi could increase our product costs 
fluctuations in the currency exchange rates have  and may continue to  adversely affect our operating results 
the recent financial crisis and current uncertainty in global economic conditions could negatively affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the recent financial crisis and the current uncertainty in global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in credit  equity and fixed income markets 
there could be a number of follow on effects from these economic developments on our business  including unavailability of credit  insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  customer insolvencies  rapid changes to the foreign currency exchange rates  decreased customer confidence  and decreased customer demand 
any of these events  or any other events caused by the recent financial crisis  may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
capacity constraints in our mexican operations could reduce our sales and revenues and hurt customer relationships 
we now rely on our mexican operations to finish and ship most of the products we sell 
since moving our manufacturing operations to our mexican facility we have experienced and may continue to experience constraints on our manufacturing capacity as we address challenges related to operating our new facility  such as hiring and training workers  creating the facility s infrastructure  developing new supplier relationships  complying with customs and border regulations  and resolving shipping and logistical issues 
our sales and revenues may be reduced and our customer relationships may be impaired if we continue to experience constraints on our manufacturing capacity 
we are working to minimize capacity constraints in a cost effective manner  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately minimize capacity constraints 
our reliance on a business processing outsourcing partner to conduct our operations in mexico could materially harm our business and prospects 
in connection with the move of most of our north american manufacturing operations to mexico  we rely on a business processing outsourcing partner to hire  subject to our oversight  the production team for our manufacturing operation  provide the selected facility described above  and coordinate many of the ongoing manufacturing logistics relating to our operations in mexico 
our outsourcing partner s related functions include acquiring the necessary mexican permits  providing the appropriate mexican operating entity  assisting in customs clearances  and providing other general assistance and administrative services in connection with the ongoing operation of the mexican facility 
our outsourcing partner s performance of these obligations efficiently and effectively is critical to the success of our operations in mexico 
failure of our outsourcing partner to perform its obligations efficiently and effectively could result in delays  unanticipated costs or interruptions in production  delays in deliveries to our customers or other harm to our business  results of operation  and liquidity 
moreover  if our outsourcing arrangement is not successful  we cannot assure our ability to find an alternative production facility or outsourcing partner to assist in our operations in mexico or our ability to operate successfully in mexico without outsourcing or similar assistance 
our net sales  operating results and liquidity have been and may in the future be adversely affected because of the decline in the retail market for dial up modems 
the dial up modem industry has been characterized by declining average selling prices and a declining retail market 
the decline in average selling prices is due to a number of factors  including technological change  lower component costs  and competition 
the decline in the size of the retail market for dial up modems is primarily due to the inclusion of dial up modems as a standard feature contained in new pcs  and the advent of broadband products 
decreasing average selling prices and reduced demand for our dial up modems have resulted and are likely to continue to result in decreased net sales for dial up modems 
if we fail to replace declining revenue from the sales of dial up modems with the sales of our other products  including our broadband modems  our business  results of operation and liquidity will be harmed 
less advantageous terms of sale of our products could harm our business 
we entered into a consignment arrangement with a significant retailer customer in october in connection with this arrangement ownership of all unsold products previously purchased from zoom reverted to us in november under the consignment arrangement we do not recognize revenue from the sale of a product until the retailer actually sells such product to its customer 
the consignment arrangement also results in a delay in the dating of invoices  the recognition of accounts receivable  and the due dates for payment by the retailer for goods sold 
if additional significant customers adopt similar arrangements or otherwise change the terms of sale  our business  results of operation and liquidity will be harmed 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to more successfully penetrate the broadband modem markets  which have been challenging markets  with significant barriers to entry 
with the shrinking of the dial up modem market  we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to more successfully penetrate the broadband modem markets  dsl and cable  and the voip market 
these markets have significant barriers to entry that have adversely affected our sales to these markets 
although some cable and dsl modems are sold at retail  the high volume purchasers of these modems are concentrated in a relatively few large cable  telecommunications  and internet service providers which offer broadband modem services to their customers 
these customers  particularly cable services providers  also have extensive and varied approval processes for modems to be approved for use on their network 
these approvals are expensive  time consuming  and continue to evolve 
successfully penetrating the broadband modem market therefore presents a number of challenges including the current limited retail market for broadband modems  the relatively small number of cable  telecommunications and internet service provider customers that make up the bulk of the market for broadband modems in certain countries  including the united states  the significant bargaining power of these large volume purchasers  the time consuming  expensive  uncertain and varied approval process of the various cable service providers  and the strong relationships with cable service providers enjoyed by incumbent cable equipment providers like motorola and cisco 
our sales of broadband products have been adversely affected by all of these factors 
sales of our broadband products in european countries have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to approvals and delays in the deployment by service providers of cable and dsl service in these countries 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to successfully penetrate these markets 
if we fail to meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards  there would be an adverse impact on our ability to sell our products and services 

the market for pc communications products and high speed broadband access products and services is characterized by aggressive pricing practices  continually changing customer demand patterns  rapid technological advances  emerging industry standards and short product life cycles 
some of our product and service developments and enhancements have taken longer than planned and have delayed the availability of our products and services  which adversely affected our sales and profitability in the past 
any significant delays in the future may adversely impact our ability to sell our products and services  and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify and respond to emerging technological trends and industry standards in the market  develop and maintain competitive products that meet changing customer demands  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis  introduce products that have competitive prices  manage our product transitions  inventory levels and manufacturing processes efficiently  respond effectively to new technological changes or new p roduct announcements by others  and meet changing industry standards 
our product cycles tend to be short  and we may incur significant non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated 
therefore  the resources we devote to product development  sales and marketing may not generate material net sales for us 
in addition  short product cycles have resulted in and may in the future result in excess and obsolete inventory  which has had and may in the future have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
in an effort to develop innovative products and technology  we have incurred and may in the future incur substantial development  sales  marketing  and inventory costs 
if we are unable to recover these costs  our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions and we still have higher cost products in inventory  our business would b e harmed and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks that could harm our business 
currently our business is significantly dependent on our operations outside the united states  particularly sales of our products and the production of most of our products 
all of our manufacturing operations except our rework operations are now located outside of the united states 
for the year sales outside north america were of our net sales 
the inherent risks of international operations could harm our business  results of operation  and liquidity 
specifically  our manufacturing operations in mexico are subject to the challenges and risks associated with international operations  including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages  currency risk  and economic  legal  political and regulatory risks 
in addition  fluctuations in the currency exchange rates have had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on our operating results 
the types of risks faced in connect ion with international operations and sales include  among others regulatory and communications requirements and policy changes  currency exchange rate fluctuations  including  as a result of the move of our manufacturing operations to mexico  changes in value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar  favoritism toward local suppliers  delays in the rollout of broadband services by cable and dsl service providers outside of the united states  local language and technical support requirements  difficulties in inventory management  accounts receivable collection and the management of distributors or representatives  cultural differences  reduced control over staff and other difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  political and economic changes and disruptions  governmental currency controls  shipping costs  and import  export  and tariff regulations we may be subject to product returns resulting from defects or from overstocking of our products 
product returns could result in the failure to attain market acceptance of our products  which would harm our business 
if our products contain undetected defects  errors  or failures  we could face delays in the development of our products  numerous product returns  and other losses to us or to our customers or end users 
any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  either of which would reduce our sales and harm our business 
we are also exposed to the risk of product returns from our customers as a result of contractual stock rotation privileges and our practice of assisting some of our customers in balancing their inventories 
overstocking has in the past led and may in the future lead to higher than normal returns 
if we fail to effectively manage our inventory levels  there could be a material and adverse affect on our liquidity and our business 
due to rapid technological change and changing markets we are required to manage our inventory levels carefully to both meet customer expectations regarding delivery times and to limit our excess inventory exposure 
in the event we fail to effectively manage our inventory our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may face increased risk of inventory obsolescence  a decline in market value of the inventory  or losses from theft  fire  or other casualty 
we may be unable to produce sufficient quantities of our products because we depend on third party manufacturers 
if these third party manufacturers fail to produce quality products in a timely manner  our ability to fulfill our customer orders would be adversely impacted 
we use contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers for electronics manufacturing of most of our products 
we use these third party manufacturers to help ensure low costs  rapid market entry  and reliability 
any manufacturing disruption could impair our ability to fulfill orders  and failure to fulfill orders would adversely affect our sales 
although we currently use four electronics manufacturers for the bulk of our purchases  in some cases a given product is only provided by one of these companies 
the loss of the services of any of our significant third party manufacturers or a material adverse change in the business of or our relationships with any of these manufacturers could harm our business 
since third parties manufacture our products and we expect this to continue in the future  our success will depend  in part  on the ability of third parties to manufacture our products cost effectively and in sufficient quantities to meet our customer demand 
we are subject to the following risks because of our reliance on third party manufacturers reduced management and control of component purchases  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and manufacturing yields  lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices  interruption of supplies from assemblers as a result of a fire  natural calamity  strike or other significant event  and misappropriation of our intellectual property 
we may be unable to produce sufficient quantities of our products because we obtain key components from  and depend on  sole or limited source suppliers 
we obtain certain key parts  components  and equipment from sole or limited sources of supply 
for example  we purchase the vast majority of our dial up and broadband modem chipsets from conexant systems 
in the past we have experienced delays in receiving shipments of modem chipsets from our sole source suppliers 
we may experience similar delays in the future 
in addition  some products may have other components that are available from only one source 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from our current sources  we would experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage relationships with our customers  and our customers could decide to purchase products from our competitors 
inability to meet our customers demand or a decision by one or more of our customer s to purchase products from our competitors could harm our operating results 
we face significant competition  which could result in decreased demand for our products or services 
we may be unable to compete successfully 
a number of companies have developed  or are expected to develop  products that compete or will compete with our products 
furthermore  many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do 
intense competition  rapid technological change and evolving industry standards could result in less favorable selling terms to our customers  decrease demand for our products or make our products obsolete 
new environmental regulations may increase our manufacturing costs and harm our business 
the state of california and other states have implemented regulations requiring the use of highly efficient power cubes 
these new requirements will affect many of our products and will typically result in an increase of to in our cost to produce those products that use us power cubes 
this is expected to reduce our gross margin for those products 
changes in current or future laws or governmental regulations and industry standards that negatively impact our products  services and technologies could harm our business 
the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission  or the fcc  extends to the entire united states communications industry including our customers and their products and services that incorporate our products 
our products are also required to meet the regulatory requirements of other countries throughout the world where our products and services are sold 
obtaining government regulatory approvals is time consuming and very costly 
in the past  we have encountered delays in the introduction of our products  such as our cable modems  as a result of government certifications 
we may face further delays if we are unable to comply with governmental regulations 
delays caused by the time it takes to comply with regulatory requirements may result in cancellations or postponements of product orders or purchases by our customers  which would harm our business 
in addition to reliability and quality standards  the market acceptance of our voip products and services is dependent upon the adoption of industry standards so that products from multiple manufacturers are able to communicate with each other 
standards are continuously being modified and replaced 
as standards evolve  we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products 
the failure of our products to comply  or delays in compliance  with various existing and evolving industry standards could delay or interrupt volume production of our products  which could harm our business 
regulation of voip services is developing and is therefore uncertain 
future regulation of voip services could increase our costs and restrict the growth of our voip business 
voip services currently have different regulations from traditional telephony in most countries including the us 
the us  various states and other countries may impose surcharges  taxes or new regulations upon providers of voip services 
the imposition of any such surcharges  taxes and regulations on voip services could materially increase our costs  may limit or eliminate our competitive pricing and may require us to restructure the voip services we currently offer 
for example  regulations requiring compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea or provision of the same type of services as required for traditional telecommunications providers could place a significant financial burden on us depending on the technical changes required to accommodate the requirements 
in many countries outside the us in which we operate or our services are sold  we cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with existing or future requirements  or that we will be able to continue to be in compliance with any such requirements 
our failure to comply with these requirements could materially adversely affect our ability to continue to offer our voip services in these jurisdictions 
our future success will depend on the continued services of our executive officers and key product development personnel 
the loss of any of our executive officers or key product development personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring skilled personnel could harm our business 
competition for skilled personnel is significant 
we may be unable to attract and retain all the personnel necessary for the development of our business 
in addition  the loss of frank b 
manning  our president and chief executive officer  or some other member of the senior management team  a key engineer or salesperson  or other key contributors  could harm our relations with our customers  our ability to respond to technological change  and our business 
we may have difficulty protecting our intellectual property 
our ability to compete is heavily affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  patents  copyrights  trademarks  and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property 
the steps we take to protect our technology may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection 
our patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
we have more intellectual property assets in some countries than we do in others 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
this may make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely 
we cannot ensure that the steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual proper ty will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
particular aspects of our technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights or patents of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which we may be required to seek licenses 
we cannot assure that the terms of any licenses we may be required to seek will be reasonable 
we are often indemnified by our suppliers relative to certain intellectual property rights  but these indemnifications do not cover all possible suits  and there is no guarantee that a relevant indemnification will be honored by the indemnifying party
