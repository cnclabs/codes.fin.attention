overview sciclone pharmaceuticals nasdaq scln is a for profit  global pharmaceutical company with a substantial international business and a product portfolio of novel therapies for cancer and infectious diseases 
our objective  which we believe we will achieve  is sustained profitability for the full year through a combination of international sales growth  a cost containing clinical development strategy  and focused expense management 
zadaxin  our brand of thymalfasin and our primary product  is sold in over countries for the treatment of the hepatitis b virus hbv and the hepatitis c virus hcv  certain cancers and as a vaccine adjuvant 
our cash position and the profit margin on our product sales and marketing operations provide the financial resources for continued growth in our international business and for development of our pipeline of phase drug candidates  including rp for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and scv for the treatment of hcv and for oral mucositis 
our dc bead product is awaiting approval in the peoples republic of china china  for the treatment of liver cancer 
we plan to expand our commercial operations  currently primarily located in china  with the goal of becoming a significant pharmaceutical company in this rapidly growing market 
a key part of our strategy is to leverage our decade of experience in china and to grow our international business by adding commercial stage or near term commercial stage products to our portfolio 
for example  after acquiring the chinese marketing rights to dc bead tm for liver cancer  we are pursuing its regulatory approval and  if approved  intend to launch this product in we believe we are well positioned to in license additional therapeutics for our international business with a focus on china  in part because of our opportunity to develop and commercialize these products utilizing our well established sales and marketing organization in china 
for the years ended december    and product sales were   and  respectively 
our revenue growth was attributable to further market penetration in china related to zadaxin 
for the years ended december    and product sales to china were   and  respectively 
sciclone continues its clinical development program potential with three product candidates being studied in four indications 
our latest stage opportunity is ready for phase which will evaluate thymalfasin as a therapy for stage iv melanoma 
we estimate that this is a million market opportunity worldwide 
if the targeted patient group can be extended to the adjuvant setting through additional clinical trials  we believe the global market opportunity could increase by about million 
we are in the process of seeking a partner for this phase trial prior to initiating enrollment 
in june  we reported positive data from a phase trial  conducted in partnership with sigma tau  treating patients with stage iv melanoma in which we showed that thymalfasin in combination with dacarbazine dtic chemotherapy and low dose interferon alpha met its primary endpoint 
further  two of the thymalfasin treated groups had an overall response rate three times higher than stage iv melanoma patients treated with dtic  the current standard of care  and low dose interferon alpha 
in addition  survival  a key secondary endpoint of the trial  was extended by nearly months 
in november  we reported that we reached an agreement on special protocol assessment with the us food and drug administration fda on the design of a phase registration trial for thymalfasin as a potential treatment for stage iv melanoma that adequately addresses the objectives necessary to support a regulatory submission 

table of contents in addition to thymalfasin  we are developing rp and scv for the treatment of life threatening diseases 
we are conducting a multi center  randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled phase clinical trial using rp in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy in approximately patients with unresectable stage iii and iv pancreatic cancer 
we announced march  that we completed enrollment of this trial ahead of schedule and expect to report results in the first half of in september  we reported what we believe are promising results from our proof of concept phase a clinical trial using scv as a sole agent administered to patients chronically infected with hcv 
the trial was designed to evaluate the effect of scv on hepatitis c viral load  as well as on other measures of immune response 
scv demonstrated activity in some treated patients in the higher dosage groups  and the decrease in viral load in these patients was accompanied by an increase in a biomarker which is usually correlated with an immunological response against hcv 
additionally  scv was shown to be generally safe and well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities or serious adverse events reported 
we are planning to initiate a phase b trial for scv in hcv in during the fourth quarter of  scv also entered phase clinical development to assess the safety and efficacy of scv for the delay to onset of severe oral mucositis in subjects receiving chemoradiation therapy for the treatment of cancers of the head and neck 
in this multi center  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled dose ranging study  we plan to enroll approximately patients and expect to complete enrollment of this trial before the end of we manufacture zadaxin  rp and scv through third party contract manufacturers  and we conduct our research and development efforts principally through arrangements with clinical research sites  contract research organizations and universities 
we believe our cash on hand and ongoing business operations and million line of credit will be sufficient to fund current business activities for the foreseeable future 
during this period  we may report quarterly losses 
our ability to sustain operating profitability will be impacted by numerous factors including expansion of our sales efforts for zadaxin  the regulatory approval process including the timing of fda or international regulatory approvals  the number  timing  costs and results of pre clinical and clinical trials of our products  market acceptance of zadaxin  and potentially of scv  dc bead  and rp  the timing of orders for zadaxin from international markets  particularly china  and the acquisition of additional product rights and the funding  if any  provided as a result of corporate partnering arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the relevance of our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of delivery 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part  except for sales to a new market where acceptance requirements have to be met 
sales to importing agents or distributors are recognized at time of shipment when title to the product is transferred to them 
importing agents or distributors do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality 
however  we are expected to replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered 
we estimate expected returns primarily on historical patterns 
historically  we have had no product returns of damaged  defective or expired product 
as such  no amount was accrued for product returns as of december  and in the respective consolidated balance sheets 
payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where collectibility is uncertain and revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
revenue associated with substantive performance milestones is recognized based on the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements and provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii there are no future performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
cash equivalents and investments cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less on the date of purchase 
we classify our investment portfolio as available for sale or trading securities 
we record the investments at fair value  on the balance sheet 
unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet 
realized gains or losses on available for sale and trading securities and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are determined on the basis of specific identification and included in other income expense 
we evaluate our investments for impairment each reporting period in accordance with fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas 
fsp fas provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
if  after consideration of all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investment  impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
fair value of financial instruments we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 effective january  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral 
table of contents of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we deferred adoption of sfas as it relates to its non financial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment  and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy 
the three levels of input are level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
effective january   we also adopted sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for specified financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis 
we elected to adopt the fair value accounting under sfas at the initial recognition of a put option from ubs ag with respect to our auction rate securities ars recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
following is a description of our valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
where quoted prices are available in an active market  fair value is based upon quoted market prices  and are classified in level of the valuation hierarchy 
level securities include our money market funds  us term deposits  corporate equity securities and restricted long term italian state bonds 
if quoted market price are not available  fair value is based upon observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities and are classified in level of the valuation hierarchy 
level securities include our certificate of deposit 
when quoted prices and observable inputs are unavailable  fair values are based on internally developed cash flow models and are classified in level of the valuation hierarchy 
the internally developed cash flow models primarily use  as inputs  estimates for interest rates and discount rates including yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors  amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the assets 
these inputs reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets including assumptions about risk developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
level securities include our ars and the put option with respect to these securities 

table of contents other financial instruments  including accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  are carried at cost  which we believe approximates fair value because of the short term maturity of these instruments 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
we maintain reserves for credit losses  and such losses have been within our expectations 
we recognize reserves for bad debts ranging from to of past due accounts receivable based on the length of time the receivables are past due and our collectibility experience 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including  but not limited to  an analysis of the historical payment patterns of our customers  the circumstances of each individual customer and their geographic region including a review of the local economic environment 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would increase our general and administrative expenses 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current inventory levels 
if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels and demand were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required which could negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations 
if obsolete items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the inventory  we will record a write down to net realizable value in the period that the impairment is first recognized 
intangible assets at december   we had net intangible assets of approximately  related to zadaxin product rights and have not recorded any impairment losses to date related to intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
research and development expenses effective january   we adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
in accordance with eitf  nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
the capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
our research and development expenses are principally incurred for our clinical trials including cost sharing of sigma tau s clinical trial in europe using zadaxin as part of a novel triple therapy combination for the treatment of hcv  our phase clinical trials for rp and scv  and our development plans for a phase clinical trial for melanoma 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous institutions that conduct the clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 

table of contents payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses to the actual services received and efforts expended 
expenses related to grants to the institutions that conduct the clinical trials on our behalf are accrued based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
expenses relating to the clinical research organization or other entities managing the trials and laboratory and other direct expenses are recognized in the period they are estimated to be incurred and the services performed 
if we underestimate or overestimate the activity associated with a study or service at a given point in time  adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods 
we monitor active patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible and adjust our estimates accordingly 
stock option valuation we apply statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
r  share based payment fas r  for stock based payment transactions in which we receive employee services in exchange for our equity instruments 
employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period  which is generally four years 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimate of the expected volatility of the market price of its stock and the expected term of the award 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider the vesting period for the award  recent historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures  and the expected volatility 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change 
we have not recognized  and do not expect to recognize in the near future  any tax benefit related to employee stock based compensation cost 
results of operations product sales were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  and all were derived from sales of zadaxin 
the increases from to were attributable to a higher volume of product sold primarily due to continued expansion of our sales and marketing efforts and a modest increase in prices from the to periods 
sales to customers in china are denominated in us dollars and accounted for approximately   and of this revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december    and  sales in each year to three or four importing agents in china accounted for approximately   and  respectively of our product sales 
in  shanghai lingyun and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for and of our sales  respectively  and one other importer accounted for of our sales 
in  shanghai lingyun and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for and of our sales  respectively  and one other importer accounted for of our sales 
in  shanghai lingyun and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for and of our sales  respectively  and two others accounted for a combined 
no other customers accounted for more than of sales in those periods 
as of december   approximately  or of our accounts receivable were attributable to two customers in china 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  and generally do not require collateral from our customers 
contract revenue was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during and  we recognized  and  respectively  in contract revenue for a partial license fee for zadaxin from a third party 
there was no similar revenue for the year ended 
table of contents december  contract revenue recognized in was in connection with the  payment we received from sigma tau in january and a  payment we received from sigma tau in december this revenue was recognized as contract revenue over the course of the zadaxin hcv us clinical program and the period of sharing the clinical data from this program with sigma tau in accordance with the performance requirements under our contract with sigma tau 
gross margin was   and in   and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in was primarily due to an increase of  in royalty expense recorded in december related to an agreement with wayne state university wsu regarding royalty obligations for the period to we expect cost of product sales and hence gross margin to vary from year to year  depending upon the level of zadaxin sales  the absorption of product related fixed costs  and any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product inventory 
research and development r d expenses were   and  and represented approximately   and of our total operating costs and expenses for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase of  in r d expenses from to related to our phase clinical trials for rp and scv  and to the development planning for a phase clinical trial for melanoma 
the increase included approximately  for clinical trial management  statistical services and investigator expenses  an increase of approximately  for drug development and manufacturing costs related to the scale up for rp and purchase of gemcitabine for the rp clinical trial  and manufacturing of scv and ribavirin for the scv clinical trial  a  milestone payment upon first patient dosing in the rp phase clinical trial  an increase in compensation and benefits expense and recruiting fees due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel  and an increase in consulting and travel expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  of acquisition and legal costs related to the acquisition of exclusive rights for the united states and canada to develop and commercialize rp recorded during the year ended december  the increase in r d expenses from to was primarily due to a  increase in acquisition and legal costs incurred in april related to the acquisition of the exclusive rights in the united states and canada to develop and commercialize rp  an increase of approximately  in clinical trial expenses and an increase of  in drug development expenses mainly related to our phase trials for rp and scv  and in preparation of a prospective phase trial for melanoma 
these increases were offset partially by decreases in r d including a decrease of  in stock based compensation expense and a  decrease in compensation and benefits related expenses  net of consulting fees  a decrease of  in preclinical pharmacology expenses  a decrease of  in rent expense due to lower rent expense related to our main office facility in the second half of  as compared with our former facility which we exited in july  and a decrease of  in computer software expense 
the major components of r d expenses include services fee costs  pass through expenses and investigator expenses incurred for clinical studies performed by clinical trial institutions and contract research organizations  related materials and supplies  preclinical and toxicology work  pharmaceutical development including product formulation and chemical analysis  license fees  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  third party research funding  and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
the initiation and continuation of our current clinical development programs has had and is expected to continue to have a significant effect on our research and development expenses 
although it is not possible to determine the total cost expected to be incurred in any particular year for each clinical trial due to the uncertain nature of the clinical trial process  we estimate that our future costs for relating to research and development will decrease compared to due to reduced spending related to our phase clinical trial for rp the actual costs incurred in future periods will vary depending in particular upon timeline and design for a zadaxin phase melanoma clinical trial and final decisions regarding the timing and expense sharing arrangements for the trial 
an expansion or significant extension of our clinical development programs may require us to seek additional capital resources 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses from to was primarily due to an increase of  in conferences and medical education seminar expenses  an increase of  in salesforce incentives  an increase of  in compensation and benefits expense due to an increase in the number of sales personnel  and an increase of  in travel and entertainment expenses  all related to our expanding sales and marketing efforts 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses from to was primarily due to increases in sales and marketing personnel  promotional activities and operating expense related to our expanding sales and marketing efforts 
we expect sales and marketing expenses for to be higher than those incurred in due to increased sales efforts 
general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased  for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to an increase in severance costs of approximately  related to the departure of our former chief financial officer  an increase in accounting and professional fees of approximately  an increase in legal fees of approximately  an increase in employment recruiting costs of approximately  and a net increase in compensation and benefits related expenses due to an increase in headcount in  offset partially by a decrease in stock based compensation expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily related to an increase in compensation and benefits related expenses of  due to an increase in general and administrative personnel  an increase in stock based compensation expense of  mainly related to our chief executive officer s option agreement  and a  increase in office expense related to the relocation of our corporate office 
we believe that general and administrative expense for will remain at a comparable level to interest and investment income was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decreases from to resulted from reduced interest earned on cash balances due to lower cash balances and due to lower interest rates in the period 
for  we expect a decrease in interest and investment income as a result of lower cash balances and lower interest rates 
interest and investment expense was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
interest expense for was primarily related to interest on the company s convertible notes payable 
the company repaid  of convertible notes in march  resulting in the decrease in interest expense for the period 
other expense income  net was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
other expense income for the year ended december  included an other than temporary impairment charge of  related to our ars investments and  of gain related to the fair value of our put option 
other income for the year ended december  period primarily related to a one time payment of  that we received in april for the resolution of our dispute with schering plough kk regarding the conduct of hbv clinical trials in japan with zadaxin 
there was no similar income recorded for the years ended december  or provision for income tax of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  relates to our foreign operations in china 
the increase of  from to was due to increased operating activity in china 
there was no similar provision for income tax recorded for the year ended december  
table of contents income taxes we have not recorded any us federal or state income tax expense for the years ended december    and undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately  at december  these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly  no deferred us income taxes have been provided thereon 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  that expire in the years through the difference between the cumulative losses for financial reporting purposes and federal income tax purposes is primarily attributable to losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   we had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately  that expire in the years through because of the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  using the average receivables method  were   and days in   and  respectively 
the majority of our sales are to customers in the people s republic of china where our accounts receivable collections have standard credit terms ranging from to days 
during the fourth quarter of  our largest customer in the people s republic of china agreed to payment terms of days instead of days in order to procure from us increased volume of zadaxin and a volume discount 
this change resulted in a reduction in our days sales outstanding in  compared to and at december    and  we had   and  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in each of these years  the principal factor affecting these balances was the net loss from operating activities 
we currently estimate cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  will be lower than the balance at december  the expected decrease in this balance is primarily attributable to cash expected to be used in operations 
the short term investments consist primarily of highly liquid marketable securities 
our restricted short term investment of  as of december   relates to a letter of credit secured by a certificate of deposit to facilitate our value added tax filings in europe 
our restricted long term investment of  consists of italian state bonds purchased to facilitate our value added tax filings in europe 
as of december   we held at fair value  of auction rate securities ars as trading securities that were reclassified from available for sale securities 
upon the reclassification of the ars to trading securities as of december   we realized a loss of  in other expense that had previously been recorded as unrealized losses in the accumulated other comprehensive income included as part of stockholders equity 
the ars are investments with contractual maturities generally between and years whose underlying assets are student loans that are substantially backed by the federal government with interest rates resetting approximately every days through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors may sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
all of our ars are rated by one or more of the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
historically  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that reset the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every days  which in turn provided liquidity at par value 
however  
table of contents as a result of liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  the auctions for all of our ars failed beginning in february when sell orders exceeded buy orders 
as of december   there continues to be no auction market for our ars 
the failures of these auctions do not affect the value of the collateral underlying the ars  and we continue to earn interest on our ars 
because of the failure of auctions  we will not be able to liquidate our ars until the issuer calls the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures 
based on this  we classified the ars as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in november  we accepted an auction rate securities rights offer rights offer from ubs ag under which  in return for a general release of claims and the grant of a right to ubs ag to purchase our ars at any time for full par value  we received the right to require ubs ag to purchase at par value our ars beginning in june the rights 
the rights are non transferable 
upon acceptance  we granted ubs ag the sole discretion and right to sell or dispose of  and or enter orders in the auction process with respect to the eligible ars on our behalf without prior notification to us from ubs ag  as long as we receive a payment at par upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our ars under the rights 
however  if the rights are not exercised before july   they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
the enforceability of the rights results in the creation of an asset akin to a put option we have the right to put the ars back to ubs at some specified date for a payment equal to the par value of the ars 
the put option is a free standing asset separate from the ars 
we recorded  of gain in other income related to the fair value of our put option included in our results of operations for the year ended december  we will continue to classify the ars investments as long term on our consolidated balance sheet until such time the investments become short term 
we believe that even with the possible requirement to hold all such securities until june   our remaining cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
net cash used in provided by operating activities totaled   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of net loss of  which was adjusted for non cash items such as stock based compensation expense of  and depreciation and amortization of  and  of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
such changes included a decrease in our accrued clinical trials of  primarily as a result of payments made to the clinical research organization managing our phase rp clinical trial and to sigma tau for the completion of the phase hepatitis c triple therapy clinical trial in europe  and included an increase of  in accrued compensation and employee benefits related to an increase in bonus accrual as a result of increased headcount during and the continued accrual of our chief executive officer s long term bonus 
operating asset changes included a decrease of  in accounts receivable related to a reduction in payment terms during with our largest customer in china from days to days to allow the customer to procure increased volume of zadaxin and a volume discount  and a decrease of  in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily related to a decrease in prepaid royalties and prepaid clinical trial expenses 
net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of net loss of  which was adjusted for non cash items such as stock based compensation expense of  and depreciation and amortization of  and  of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
such changes included an increase in our accrued clinical trials expenses of  and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of  both increases related primarily to our phase rp and scv clinical trials  and to the development plans for a melanoma clinical trial 
these inflows were partially offset by an increase in inventory levels of  as our supplier of bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient api product for the manufacture of zadaxin was able to produce higher yields on production runs  enabling us to increase our inventory levels  compared to the lower than planned inventory levels in the prior year period  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of  mainly related to our phase rp clinical trial 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  was primarily due to the net income of  which was adjusted for non cash expense related to employee stock options of  and depreciation and amortization of  and  of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
such changes included an increase in accounts receivable of  due to fluctuations in the timing of payments received within credit terms from customers and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of  primarily related to an increase in the royalty accrual

table of contents additionally  the company is obligated to pay wayne state university a royalty based on a percentage of zadaxin sales in certain countries other than china 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the above commitments  as a result of our acquisition of the exclusive rights in the united states and canada to develop and commercialize rp  we may be obligated to pay post phase success based regulatory and commercial milestone payments up to  and royalties on future sales of rp to avantogen and resprotect 
we also have entered into an agreement with pharmaceutical research associates  inc pra for clinical trials management services  for a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  phase study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rp  for the treatment of pancreatic cancer 
the estimated cost of pra s management services and pass through costs is  and  respectively  of which  had been paid by the company to pra and  was payable to pra as of december  the remaining amounts are expected to be paid to pra as incurred  through the second quarter of we entered into a supply agreement with resprotect to purchase rp from resprotect for clinical trials and for commercial purposes following regulatory approval 
under the terms of the supply agreement  sciclone and resprotect will share the scale up costs required to manufacture rp prior to and after fda approval 
our share of the scale up costs is estimated to be  through june  of which we had paid   to resprotect through december   leaving a balance of approximately   based upon december  conversion rates 
to provide us additional flexibility in managing our operations and funding our clinical trials  in november  sciclone and its subsidiaries  spil and spil china as borrowers  entered into a loan and security agreement and an unconditional guaranty and security agreement with silicon valley bank under which we may borrow up to  the credit facility 
the credit facility is a line of credit that permits borrowing up to  for a term of months  subject to certain sublimits  including  for letters of credit 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority secured interest in all of our assets  other than intellectual property  and a credit insurance policy insuring certain foreign account receivable assets 
sciclone pharmaceuticals  inc  as the parent of spil and spil china  is the guarantor of the credit facility 
the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus at december  on outstanding balances 
subsequent to november   we will be subject to an unused line fee and minimum monthly interest 
we are required to meet certain financial covenants  including minimum consolidated revenue  and minimum consolidated earnings before interest and income tax  as defined 
we are also required to meet certain operating covenants that limit our ability to incur liabilities  create liens  make capital expenditures  pay dividends or distributions  make investments  and dispose of assets 
the line of credit expires in november  and upon termination all amounts borrowed must be repaid in full 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit  and there was  available for future borrowing 
we believe our cash on hand  ongoing business operations and line of credit will be sufficient to fund current business activities for the foreseeable future 
however  we intend to continue to explore alternatives for financing to provide additional flexibility in managing our operations and funding our clinical trials 
the unavailability or the inopportune timing of any financing could prevent or delay our long term product development and commercialization programs  either of which could hurt our business 
we cannot assure you that funds from financings will be sufficient to complete current plans to conduct and complete clinical trials 
the need  timing and amount of any such financing would depend upon numerous factors  including the level of zadaxin sales  the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to zadaxin  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing  the timing of regulatory approvals  developments in relationships with existing or future collaborative parties  the status of competitive products  and various alternatives for financing 
we have not determined the timing or structure of any transaction 

table of contents related party transactions none of our officers or directors were involved in related party transactions in we have licensed to sigma tau exclusive zadaxin development and marketing rights that cover all countries in the european union as defined on january   in addition to iceland  norway and switzerland 
sigma tau and affiliated persons were our stockholders at the time this transaction was entered into  and are currently our largest shareholder 
under our agreement with sigma tau  sigma tau conducted a multi center phase hepatitis c triple therapy clinical trial in europe with patients 
the objective of the european trial was to provide data on thymalfasin s use as part of a triple therapy in treating hcv patients 
we paid sigma tau approximately  of funding support during the course of patient enrollment and trial period through december  we will also pay a  milestone payment upon completion of the final report  expected in based on the level of activity in this trial  we have recorded approximately   and  of research and development expense related to this trial in the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had accrued clinical trial expenses of  and  respectively  due to sigma tau 
under our agreement with sigma tau related to the clinical development of zadaxin  we received  in the first quarter of this contract revenue was recognized over the estimated time to complete the zadaxin us phase hcv clinical trials and deliver the clinical data  the substantive performance requirements under the contract 
for the year ended december   we recognized contract revenue of  related to this agreement 
no contract revenue was recognized in or related to this agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements there were no off balance sheet arrangements in   or recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb released emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaboration arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property eitf  which focuses on how the parties to a collaborative arrangement should account for costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties  how sharing payments pursuant to a collaboration agreement should be presented in the income statement and certain related disclosure questions 
eitf is effective for all fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in money market funds  certificates of deposit  and us treasury  or us government agency notes 
in the past  we also invested in highly rated  auction rate securities 
the auction rate securities are classified as trading securities as of december   and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with realized gains or losses reported as income loss 
all of our investments mature within one year from date of purchase except for the auction rate securities whose ultimate maturities range from to years  and our italian state bonds that mature in our holdings in investments  of any one issue  do not exceed of our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
our investments in our investment securities are subject to interest rate risk 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term notes and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
a hypothetical basis 
table of contents point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in fair value of our available for sale securities 
this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
as of december   we held approximately  in auction rate securities  classified as long term assets  with an auction rate feature whose underlying assets are generally student loans that are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction has failed since february effective january   we determined the fair market values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in sfas that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs level and level inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs level inputs when measuring fair value 
given the current failures in the auction markets to provide quoted market prices of the ars securities as well as the lack of any correlation to these instruments to other observable market data  we valued these securities using a pricing model with the most significant inputs categorized as level significant inputs that went into the model were the credit quality of the issuer  the percentage and types of guarantees such as federal family education loan program ffelp  the probability of the auction succeeding or the security being called  an illiquidity discount factor  and tax status 
in december  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of  related to the ars 
changes in the assumptions of the model based on dynamic market conditions could have a significant impact on the valuation of these securities  which may lead us in the future to take further impairment charges for these securities 
we have recorded our put option at its fair value of  in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  we estimate the fair value of the put option based on a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors  amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
these inputs reflect our assumptions about risk  developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
during year ended december   we recorded  of gain in other income related to the fair value of the put option 
changes in the assumptions of the model based on dynamic market conditions could have a significant impact on the valuation of this asset  which may lead us in the future to record gains or losses for this asset 
substantially all our sales and most of our manufacturing costs to date have been in us dollars 
however  some of our purchases with contract manufacturers are denominated in euros and costs of our marketing efforts in china are paid in local currency 
in addition  we have certain cash balances denominated in euros 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations  and we do not hedge against the risk associated with such fluctuations 
consequently  changes in exchange rates could unpredictably  materially and adversely affect our operating results and stock price and could result in exchange losses  although such losses have been insignificant to date
