our mission is to provide simple  reliable and affordable storage for consumer use in portable devices 
we sell sandisk branded products for consumer electronics through broad global retail and oem distribution channels 
we design  develop and manufacture products and solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory  controller and firmware technologies 
we source the vast majority of our flash memory supply through our significant venture relationships with toshiba which provide us with leading edge  low cost memory wafers 
our cards are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones  digital cameras  gaming devices and laptop computers 
we also produce usb drives  mp players  ssds  and embedded flash storage products 

table of contents our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices  which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products 
we believe the market for flash storage is generally price elastic 
accordingly  we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices  consumers will demand an increasing number of gigabytes and or units of memory and that over time  new markets will emerge 
in order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage products  we must reduce our cost per gigabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per gigabyte  and the average capacity of our products must grow enough to offset price declines 
we seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements  primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  fair value measurements  as of the beginning of fiscal year in february  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have only adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to our financial assets and liabilities 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
see note  investments and fair value measurements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  establishing the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities  which permits entities to elect  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
as of december   we did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets and liabilities that were not previously measured at fair value 
see note  investments and fair value measurements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   has been corrected to million from million as reported in our form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  this correction has correspondingly reduced our net loss and net loss per share for fiscal year and adjusted net assets at december  critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  among others  those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories and related reserves  investments  long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies  share based compensation  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
however  future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform tests for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that other long lived assets may not be recoverable 
this analysis differs from our goodwill analysis in that an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows 
we recorded impairments of certain acquisition related amortizable intangible assets of million in fiscal year based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows 
in addition  we recorded impairments of our investments in flash partners and flash alliance of million in fiscal year based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows 
these forecasted discounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
our estimates of market segment growth and our market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
we perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year  or more often if there are indicators of impairment present 
the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  or step  we compare our fair value to our carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the net assets  goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step  or step  of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
to determine the fair value used in step  we use our market capitalization based upon our quoted closing stock price per nasdaq  including an estimated control premium that an investor would be willing to pay for a controlling interest in us 
the determination of a control premium requires the use of judgment and is based primarily on comparable industry and deal size transactions  related synergies and other benefits 
when we are required to perform a step analysis  determining the fair value of our net assets and our off balance sheet intangibles used in step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we performed our annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
however  based on a combination of factors  including the economic environment  our current and forecasted operating results  nand industry pricing conditions and a sustained decline in our market capitalization  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and we recognized an impairment charge of million 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs 
we recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title and acceptance  if applicable  fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization 
sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and  therefore  the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer  or the rights of return expire 
at december  and december   deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million  respectively 
estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we record estimated reductions to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings  including price protection  promotions  co op advertising  and other volume based incentives and expected returns 
additionally  we have incentive programs that require us to estimate  based on historical experience  the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
all sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues 
in calculating the value of sales incentive programs  actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell through data from our customers 
the timing and resolution of these claims could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues 
in addition  actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates  which could impact the revenue we report 
inventories and inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales  industry trends  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors 
should actual market conditions differ from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally six to twelve months 
to the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than both our product on hand and on noncancelable orders  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
accounting for variable interest entities 
we evaluate whether entities in which we have invested are variable interest entities within the definition of the fasb interpretation no 
r  or fin r  accounting for variable interest entities 
if those entities are variable interest entities  or vies  we then determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to expected gains and losses 
the assessment of the primary beneficiary includes an analysis of the forecast and contractual stipulations of the vie 
determining whether we would consolidate or apply the equity method to a particular vie requires review of the vie s forecast  which involves analysis of company specific data  industry data  known trends and uncertainties  which are inherently subjective 
consolidating a vie under fin r rather than using the equity method can materially impact revenue  gross margin and operating income trends 
deferred tax assets 
we must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
in determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance  we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income  estimates of future income and tax planning strategies 
we have incurred cumulative losses in recent years and determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  based on all available evidence  that there was substantial uncertainty as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets in future periods and accordingly we recorded a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us and certain foreign net deferred tax assets 
our estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence  complexity of the matter  available federal tax case law  interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates 
there is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future results

product gross margins in fiscal year decreased percentage points compared to fiscal year due to excess industry supply which led to price per megabyte declining faster than cost per megabyte and also led to lower of cost or market inventory charges 
gross margin was also negatively impacted by charges for excess inventory of certain products and flash alliance venture costs  partially offset by insurance proceeds related to claims on a fab power outage that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal year in addition  cost of product increased due to amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of million  which accounted for approximately percentage points

cash provided by operating activities is generated by net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operations was million for fiscal year as compared to cash provided by operations of million for fiscal year the decline in cash provided by operations in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from our net loss of billion offset by non cash impairments 
cash flow from accounts receivable in fiscal year was positively impacted by increased collection efforts and by reduced product accounts receivable levels as compared with the prior year period 
the increase in inventory was related primarily to the expansion of capacity and production at flash alliance and flash partners while revenue from our products declined from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in other assets was due to the increase in tax receivables related to tax refunds expected on carryback claims due to the fiscal year net loss 
within operating activities for fiscal year  there was an increase in cash provided primarily related to an increase in related parties payables due to timing of flash ventures payments at fiscal year year end  an increase in other liabilities related to flash ventures capacity under utilization accrual  timing of the cash settlement of outstanding hedge contracts  and lower deferred income on shipments to distributors and retailers related to lower revenue levels 
operating activities generated million of cash during the fiscal year ended december  the primary sources of operating cash flow for the fiscal year ended december  were net income  adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  share based compensation  loss on equity investments and deferred taxes  and changes in balance sheet accounts including a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable trade and accounts payable to related parties  which were partially offset by increases in inventory and other assets and a decrease in other liabilities 
investing activities 
cash provided from investing activities for fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in investing activities of billion in fiscal year the increase in cash provided from investing was primarily related to reduced purchases of short and long term investments due to our higher liquidity requirements and the return of million on our investment in flashvision and million from the sale of millimeter fab equipment that we owned directly as compared to the return of million from flashvision in the fiscal year usage of cash for investments in and loans to flash partners and flash alliance was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year we used billion for investing activities during the fiscal year ended december  purchases of short and long term investments  net of proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments  totaled million

table of contents financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year of million as compared to cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal year was primarily related to lower cash proceeds from employee stock programs and repayment of debt financing in fiscal year offset by the termination of the share repurchase programs which used cash in fiscal year we used million of cash for financing activities during the fiscal year ended december  comprised primarily of million to purchase treasury shares pursuant to our share repurchase program  partially offset by cash received from exercises of share based awards of million 
additionally  during the fiscal year ended december   we received a tax benefit of million on employee stock programs 
liquid assets 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of billion 
we have billion of long term investments which we believe are also liquid assets  but are classified as long term investments due to the remaining maturity of the investment being greater than one year 
short term liquidity 
as of december   our working capital balance was billion 
we expect our loans to and investments in flash ventures as well as our investments in property  plant and equipment to be approximately billion in fiscal year our short term liquidity is impacted in part by our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in the outstanding flash ventures master lease agreements 
the flash ventures master lease agreements contain customary covenants for japanese lease facilities as well as an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to us as guarantor  including  among other things  our failure to maintain a minimum shareholder equity of at least billion  and our failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of bb from standard poors  or s p  or moody s corporation  or a minimum corporate rating of bb from rating investment information  inc  or r i 
as of december   flash ventures was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants 
while our s p credit rating was b  two levels below the required minimum corporate rating threshold from s p  our r i credit rating was bbb  one level above the required minimum corporate rating threshold from r i 
on february   r i confirmed our credit rating at bbb with a change in outlook from stable to negative 
if r i were to downgrade our credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold  flash ventures would become non compliant with certain covenants under its master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the non compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements 
such resolution could include  among other things  supplementary security to be supplied by us  as guarantor  or increased interest rates or waiver fees  should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances 
if a resolution was unsuccessful  we could be required to pay a portion or the entire outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantee under such flash ventures master lease agreements of up to billion  based upon the exchange rate at december   which could negatively impact our short term liquidity 
long term requirements 
depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future 
we may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions 
these activities may require us to raise additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain  and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts could prevent us from funding flash ventures  increasing our wafer supply  developing or enhancing our products  taking advantage of future opportunities  engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies  growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could harm our business

concurrent with the issuance of the senior convertible notes due  we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as of december   the warrants had an expected life of approximately years and expire in august at expiration  we may  at our option  elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis

in addition  counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately million shares of our common stock  which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the senior convertible notes due in full  at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the senior convertible notes due or the first day that none of the senior convertible notes due remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the senior convertible notes due as of december   we had not purchased any shares under this convertible bond hedge agreement

this equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the flash ventures from us and toshiba as well as through operating leases received by flash ventures from third party banks and guaranteed by us and toshiba 
flash ventures purchase wafers from toshiba at cost and then resells those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup 
we are contractually obligated to purchase half of flash ventures nand wafer supply or to pay for of the fixed costs of flash ventures 
we are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the wafers 
see note  related parties and strategic investments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
the cost of the wafers we purchase from flash ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of product revenues 
flash ventures are variable interest entities  however  we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we are entitled to less than a majority of expected gains and losses with respect to each venture 
accordingly  we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate 
under flash ventures agreements  we agreed to share in toshiba s costs associated with nand product development and our common semiconductor research and development activities 
as of december   we had accrued liabilities related to those common research and development expenses of million 
our common research and development obligation related to flash ventures is variable based on an annual forecasted joint research and development costs as mutually agreed upon by us and toshiba 
in addition to general nand product development and common semiconductor research performed by toshiba  both parties perform direct research and development activities specific to flash ventures  and our contribution is based on a variable computation 
we and toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory

our total master lease obligation guarantee  net of lease payments  as of december   was billion japanese yen  or approximately billion based upon the exchange rate at december  from time to time  we and toshiba mutually approve increases in the wafer supply capacity of flash ventures that may contractually obligate us to increase capital funding 
as of december   flash partners fab had reached full capacity of approximately  wafers per month  however  we expect to continue to invest in flash partners in order to convert to future technology nodes 
the capacity of flash alliance s fab at full expansion is expected to be approximately  wafers per month  and the timeframe to reach full capacity is to be mutually agreed upon by both parties 
in fiscal year  fab was ramped to more than of this estimated full capacity 
we are currently not investing in further capacity expansion of fab as weak macroeconomic conditions coupled with the growth of our nand supply base have resulted in us carrying excess inventory 
during the remainder of fiscal year  we expect to invest approximately million in flash ventures primarily for future technology nodes  which we expect will be funded through additional investments and loans to flash ventures  and working capital contributions from flash ventures 
on january   we entered into definitive agreements with toshiba  under which we and toshiba agreed to restructure flash partners and flash alliance to provide for the acquisition by toshiba of certain production capacity in connection with the production of nand flash memory products at the facilities 
the agreements specify the terms and conditions under which each flash venture has agreed to sell to toshiba more than of its current production capacity through the acquisition by toshiba of certain owned and leased equipment 
the total value of the restructuring transaction to us is approximately million based upon the exchange rate as of january  approximately one third of this value will be in cash paid to us and approximately two thirds of this value represents a transfer of lease obligations to toshiba which should reduce our outstanding lease obligations and associated lease guarantees by approximately 
these transactions are expected to occur at several closings between january  and march   subject to certain closing conditions and contingencies 
flashvision venture with toshiba 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we and toshiba determined that production of nand flash memory products utilizing millimeter wafers was no longer cost effective relative to market prices for nand flash memory and decided to wind down the flashvision venture 
as part of the ongoing wind down of flashvision  toshiba purchased certain assets of flashvision 
the existing master equipment lease agreement between flashvision and a consortium of financial institutions has been retired  thereby releasing us from our contingent indemnification obligation with toshiba 
due to the wind down qualifying as a reconsideration event under fin r  we re evaluated and concluded that flashvision is no longer a variable interest entity within the scope of fin r 
in fiscal year  we received distributions of million  relating to our investment in flashvision 
we took impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and million in the third quarter of fiscal year due to flashvision s difficulty in selling the remaining excess capital equipment due to deteriorating market conditions for equipment related to the production of millimeter nand based flash memory products 
at december   we had a net investment in flashvision of million denominated in japanese yen  offset by million of cumulative translation adjustments recorded in accumulated oci within stockholder s equity of the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at december   and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years are presented in textual and tabular format in note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
impact of currency exchange rates exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our nand flash wafers 
in addition  we also have significant costs denominated in the chinese renminbi  or rmb  and the israeli new shekel  or ils 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
in fiscal years and  we used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  in fiscal year  we used foreign currency forward contracts and options to partially hedge our future japanese yen costs for nand flash wafers 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income expense or as a component of accumulated oci and subsequently reclassified into cost of product revenues in the same period or periods in which the cost of product revenues is recognized

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investment grade marketable securities 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
the majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar  with some revenues transacted in the euro  the great british pound  and the japanese yen 
our flash memory costs  which represent the largest portion of our cost of revenues  are denominated in the japanese yen 
we also have some cost of revenues denominated in rmb 
the majority of our operating expenses are denominated in the us dollar  however  we have expenses denominated in ils and numerous other currencies 
on the balance sheet  we have numerous foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  with the largest monetary exposure being our notes receivable from the flash ventures  which are denominated in the japanese yen 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains or losses generated by the remeasurement of our significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
the fair value of these contracts is reflected as other current assets or other current liabilities and the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense to largely offset the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income expense 
we use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially hedge our future japanese yen flash memory costs 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated oci and subsequently recognized in cost of product revenues in the same period the hedged cost of product revenues is recognized 
at december  we had foreign currency forward exchange contracts in place that amounted to a net sale in us dollar equivalent of approximately million in foreign currencies to hedge our foreign currency denominated monetary net asset position 
the maturities of these contracts were months or less 
at december  we had foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option contracts in place that amounted to a net purchase in us dollar equivalent of approximately million to partially hedge our expected future wafer purchases in japanese yen 
the maturities of these contracts were months or less 

table of contents the notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges as of december  is shown in the table below 
this table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent 
these changes in fair values would be largely offset in other income expense by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
notional amount unrealized gain loss as of december  change in fair value due to adverse rate movement in thousands balance sheet hedge forward contracts sold balance sheet hedge forward contracts purchased total net forward contracts sold the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of december  is shown in the table below 
this table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent 
notional amount unrealized gain loss as of december  change in fair value due to adverse rate movement in thousands cash flow hedge forward contracts purchased cash flow hedge option contracts purchased total cash flow hedge contracts purchased notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks  we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures  and there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we do hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
market risk 
we also hold available for sale equity securities in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies 
as of december   a reduction in price of of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
