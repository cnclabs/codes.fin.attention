item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to help provide an understanding of sourcefire  inc s financial condition and results of operations 
this item of our annual report on form k is organized as follows overview 
this section provides a general description of our business  the performance indicators that we use in assessing our financial condition and results of operations  and anticipated trends that we expect to affect our financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the three years ended december  liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows for the year ended december  and a discussion of our capital requirements and the resources available to us to meet those requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
this section discusses accounting policies that are considered important to our financial condition and results of operations  require significant judgment or require estimates on our part in applying them 
our significant accounting policies  including those considered to be critical accounting policies  are summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a leading provider of enterprise threat management  or etm  intelligent security infrastructure solutions for information technology  or it  environments of commercial enterprises such as healthcare  financial services  manufacturing  energy  education  retail  and telecommunications and federal and state government organizations 
the sourcefire d system comprised of multiple sourcefire hardware and software product offerings provides a comprehensive  intelligent approach to network protection that equips our customers with an efficient and effective layered security defense protecting computer network assets before  during and after an attack 
we sell our network security solutions to a diverse customer base that includes fortune companies  global companies  us government agencies and small and mid size businesses 
we also manage two of the security industry s leading open source initiatives  snort and clamav 
key financial metrics and trends our financial results are affected by a number of factors  including broad economic conditions  the amount and type of technology spending of our customers  and the financial condition of our customers and the industries and geographic areas that we serve 
during the second half of  the industries and geographic areas that we serve experienced weakness as macroeconomic conditions  credit market conditions  and levels of business confidence and activity deteriorated 
during the fourth quarter of  some of our commercial customers delayed purchases of our products and services in response to these factors and the operating and financial difficulties facing these customers 
we expect to continue to experience some delays in customer purchases but cannot yet predict if this trend will worsen or the extent to which customers may decide not to purchase our products and services as a result of these or other factors 
we are continuing to monitor economic conditions and their potential effect on our customers and on us 
a severe or prolonged economic downturn could affect our customers financial condition and the levels of business activity 
this could reduce demand and depress pricing for our products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
during  a significant portion of our revenue growth resulted from sales of our products to us government agencies 
contracts with the us federal and state and other national and state government agencies accounted for  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect sales to us government agencies to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in a reduction in the amount of us government purchases of our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we evaluate our performance on the basis of several performance indicators  including pricing and discounts  credit and collections  revenue  cost of revenue  gross profit  and operating expenses 
we compare these key performance indicators  on a quarterly basis  to both target amounts established by management and to our performance for prior periods 
pricing and discounts we maintain a standard price list for all of our products 
additionally  we have a corporate policy that governs the level of discounts our sales organization may offer on our products  based on factors such as transaction size  volume of products  federal or state programs  reseller or distributor involvement and the level of technical support commitment 
our total product revenue and the resulting cost of revenue and gross profit percentage are directly affected by our ability to manage our product pricing policy 
during the fourth quarter of  in some cases we increased discounts on the prices of our products and services as a result of the operating and financial difficulties facing our customers  and in response to discounts offered by our competitors 
we expect the pressure to provide increased discounts to continue and  in the future  we may be forced to further discount or reduce our prices to remain competitive 
credit and collections we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to accepting an order for our products and extending the customer terms of payment which typically range from to days from the date of our invoice 
in the fourth quarter of we experienced an increase in the aging of our outstanding receivables which we attributed to the decline in macroeconomic conditions and credit market conditions 
although our actual write offs of uncollectible accounts were less than  for all of  as a result of the increase in our receivables  we increased our reserve for uncollectible accounts 
we believe that the decline in macroeconomic conditions may lead to a further increase in the aging of our receivables and we may have to increase our reserve as a result 
revenue we currently derive revenue from product sales and services 
product revenue is principally derived from the sale of our network security solutions 
our network security solutions include a perpetual software license bundled with a third party hardware platform 
services revenue is principally derived from technical support and professional services 
we typically sell technical support to complement our network security product solutions 
technical support entitles a customer to product updates  new rule releases and both telephone and web based assistance for using our products 
our professional services revenue includes optional installation  configuration and tuning  which we refer to collectively as network security deployment services 
these network security deployment services typically occur on site after delivery has occurred 
product sales are typically recognized as revenue at shipment of the product to the customer 
for sales through resellers and distributors  we recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product only if those resellers and distributors provide us  at the time of placing their order  with the identity of the end user customer to whom the product has been sold 
we recognize revenue from services when the services are performed 
for technical support services  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the support arrangement  which is generally months 
our support agreements generally provide for payment in advance 
we sell our network security solutions globally 
however   and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  was generated by sales to us based customers 
we expect that our revenue from customers based outside of the united states will increase in amount and as a percentage of total revenue as we strengthen our international presence 
we also expect that our revenue from sales through our indirect sales channel  comprised of resellers  distributors  managed security service providers  or mssps  government integrators and other partners  will increase in amount and as a percentage of total revenue as we expand our current relationships and establish new relationships with these third parties 
historically  our product revenue has been seasonal  with a significant portion of our total product revenue in recent fiscal years generated in the fourth quarter 
the timing of our year end shipments could materially affect our fourth quarter product revenue in any fiscal year and quarterly comparisons 
revenue from our government customers has been influenced by the september th fiscal year end of the us federal government  which has historically resulted in our revenue from government customers being highest in the third quarter 
notwithstanding these general seasonal patterns  our revenue within a particular quarter is often affected significantly by the unpredictable procurement patterns of our customers 
our prospective customers usually spend a long time evaluating and making purchase decisions for network security solutions 
historically  many of our customers have not finalized their purchasing decisions until the final weeks or days of a quarter 
we expect these purchasing patterns to continue in the future 
therefore  a delay in even one large order beyond the end of the quarter could materially reduce our anticipated revenue for a quarter 
because many of our expenses must be incurred before we expect to generate revenue  delayed orders could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and could therefore cause us to fail to meet the financial performance expectations of securities industry research analysts or investors 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of the hardware platform bundled into our network security solution  royalties for third party software included in our network security solution  materials and labor that are incorporated in the quality assurance of our products  logistics  warranty  shipping and handling costs and  in the limited instances where we lease our network security solutions to our customers  depreciation and amortization 
hardware costs  which are our most significant cost item  generally have not fluctuated materially as a percentage of revenue in recent years because competition among hardware platform suppliers has remained strong and  therefore  unit hardware costs have remained consistent 
because of the competition among hardware suppliers and our outsourcing of the manufacture of our products to three separate domestic contract manufacturers  we currently have no reason to expect that our cost of product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue will change significantly in the foreseeable future due to hardware pricing increases 
however  hardware or other costs of manufacturing may increase in the future 
we incur labor and associated overhead expenses  such as occupancy costs and fringe benefits costs  as part of managing our outsourced manufacturing process 
these costs are included as a component of our cost of product revenue 
cost of services revenue includes the direct labor costs of our employees and outside consultants engaged to furnish those services  as well as their travel and associated direct material costs 
additionally  we include in cost of services revenue an allocation of overhead expenses such as occupancy costs  fringe benefits and supplies  as well as the cost of time and materials to service or repair the hardware component of our products covered under a renewed support arrangement beyond the manufacturer s warranty 
as our customer base continues to grow  we anticipate incurring an increasing amount of these service and repair costs  as well as costs for additional personnel to support and service our customers 
gross profit our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of our products  our pricing policy  technical support and professional services  new product introductions  the cost of hardware platforms  the cost of labor to generate such revenue and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 
our gross profit would be adversely affected by price declines or pricing discounts if we are unable to reduce costs on existing products and fail to introduce new products with higher margins 
currently  product sales typically have a lower gross profit as a percentage of revenue than our services due to the cost of the hardware platform 
our gross profit for any particular quarter could be adversely affected if we do not complete a sufficient level of sales of higher margin products by the end of the quarter 
as discussed above  many of our customers do not finalize purchasing decisions until the final weeks or days of a quarter  so a delay in even one large order of a higher margin product could reduce our total gross profit percentage for that quarter 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll  benefits and related occupancy and other overhead for our engineers  costs for professional services to test our products  and costs associated with data used by us in our product development 
we have expanded our research and development capabilities and expect to continue to expand these capabilities in the future 
we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive to enhance our ability to serve our existing commercial and federal government markets as well as new markets for security solutions 
to meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 
accordingly  we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future  however  as a percentage of revenue we expect these expenses to remain relatively flat 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  incentive compensation  benefits and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  trade show  advertising  marketing and other brand building costs  marketing consultants and other professional services  training  seminars and conferences  travel and related costs  and occupancy and other overhead costs 
as we focus on increasing our market penetration  expanding internationally and continuing to build brand awareness  we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of our revenue  in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  incentive compensation  benefits and related occupancy and other overhead costs for executive  legal  finance  information technology  human resources and administrative personnel  corporate development expenses and professional fees related to legal  audit  tax and regulatory compliance  travel and related costs  information systems  our enterprise resource planning  or erp  system and other infrastructure costs  and corporate insurance 
general and administrative expenses increased during the period of time leading up to our ipo and  as we operate as a public company  we have incurred additional expenses for costs associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  directors and officers liability insurance  our investor relations function  and an increase in personnel to perform sec reporting functions 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  using the prospective transition method  which requires us to apply its provisions only to awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after the effective date 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized beginning january  is based on the grant date fair value of stock awards granted or modified after january  we use the black scholes option pricing model  except for certain option awards that contain market conditions relating to our stock price achieving specified levels  in which case we use a lattice option pricing model  to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and employee stock purchases 
the use of option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term and the expected stock price volatility 
based on the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards  we recognized aggregate stock based compensation expense of million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations revenue 
the following table shows products and technical support and professional services revenue in thousands year ended year ended december  variance december  variance products percentage of total revenue technical support and professional services percentage of total revenue total revenue the increase in our product revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was mostly driven by higher demand for our sensor products  primarily our enterprise class d products 
for the year ended december   sensor product revenue increased million over the prior year  including a million increase in our enterprise class d products 
the increase in our services revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted from an increase in our installed customer base due to new product sales in which associated support was purchased  as well as support renewals by our existing customers 
the increase in our product revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was also driven primarily by higher demand for our sensor products  sales of which increased million  including million of sales from our sensors introduced in the fourth quarter of in addition  royalty income increased million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our software only license products of million 
the increase in our services revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted from our support services being provided to a larger installed customer base comprised of new customers  as well as current customers who renewed their maintenance subscriptions 
cost of revenue 
the following table shows products and technical support and professional services cost of revenue in thousands year ended year ended december  variance december  variance products percentage of total revenue technical support and professional services percentage of total revenue total cost of revenue percentage of total revenue the increases in product cost of revenue for compared to and compared to were driven primarily by higher volume demand in each year for our sensor products  for which we must procure and provide the hardware platform to our customers 
we did not experience a material increase in our cost per unit of hardware platforms  which is the largest component of our product cost of revenue 
the increase in our services cost of revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was attributable to increased hardware service expense related to support renewal contracts and our hiring of additional personnel to both service our larger installed customer base and to provide training and professional services to our customers 
our services cost of revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   increased primarily due to our hiring of additional personnel to both service our larger installed customer base and to provide training and professional services to our customers 
gross profit 
the following table shows products and technical support and professional services gross profit in thousands year ended year ended december  variance december  variance products products gross margin technical support and professional services technical support and professional services gross margin total gross profit total gross margin products gross margin remained relatively flat for compared to and for compared to technical support and professional services gross margin for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  also remained relatively flat 
gross margin for technical support and professional services for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  increased primarily due to additional  higher margin services revenues  which grew at a higher rate than our product revenues 
operating expenses 
the following table highlights our operating expenses in thousands year ended year ended december  variance december  variance research and development percentage of total revenue sales and marketing percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization percentage of total revenue in process research and development percentage of total revenue total operating expenses percentage of total revenue research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased over the prior year  primarily due to an increase in salaries  incentive compensation  benefits and occupancy overhead expenses of million and an increase in stock based compensation expense of  partially offset by a one time expense of million in in connection with the clamav acquisition for the completion of additional source code 
the increased expenses in resulted from the hiring of additional personnel in our research and development department to support the release of updates and enhancements to our d products 
the increase in the amount of research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase in payroll  benefits and overhead expenses of million  a one time expense of million in in connection with the clamav acquisition for the completion of additional source code and an increase in stock based compensation expense of  due to the hiring of additional personnel in our research and development department to support the release of updates and enhancements to our d products 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased over the prior year  primarily due to an increase of million in salary  commissions and incentive compensation and benefit expenses as a result of additional sales and marketing personnel and increased revenue  an increase of  in travel and travel related expenses  an increase of  in advertising  promotion  partner marketing programs and trade show expenses in support of our network security solutions and an increase of  in stock based compensation expense 
the increase in the amount of sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase of million in payroll and benefit expenses for additional sales and marketing personnel  an increase of  in sales travel and travel related expenses  an increase of  for stock based compensation expense and an increase of  for advertising  promotion  partner marketing programs and trade show expenses in support of our network security solutions 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased over the prior year  primarily due to an increase of million in corporate development expenses and professional fees related to legal  accounting  information technology  audit  tax and regulatory compliance  an increase of million in salaries  incentive compensation and benefit expenses for personnel hired in our executive  accounting  information technology  human resources and legal departments  an increase of  in director attendance  retainer and other board related fees  one time costs associated with our ceo transition of  stock based compensation expense of  for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards for our former ceo and an additional increase of  in stock based compensation expense for general and administrative personnel 
the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase of payroll and benefits of million for personnel hired in our accounting  information technology  human resources and legal departments  an increase of  for stock based compensation expense  an increase of million in professional fees related to audit  tax and regulatory compliance  and an increase of  in insurance premiums primarily due to an increase in our d o insurance coverage 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased over the prior year  primarily due to the depreciation of additional lab and testing equipment purchased for our engineering department and computers purchased for personnel hired since december   as well as the depreciation associated with our new erp system 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was principally due to amortization of leasehold improvements relating to our uk office  additional lab and testing equipment purchased for the engineering department and personal computers purchased for personnel hired since december  in process research and development expense for the year ended december  was attributable to the august acquisition of certain assets of clamav for which technological feasibility had not yet been reached and no alternative future use existed 
other income  net and income tax expense 
the following table shows our other income  net and income tax expense in thousands year ended year ended december  variance december  variance other income  net percentage of total revenue income tax expense percentage of total revenue other income  net for the year ended december  decreased as compared to the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in interest and investment income as a result of lower average interest rates on invested cash balances 
other income for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year  primarily due to an increase in interest and investment income as a result of higher cash balances resulting from our march ipo 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december  and  our deferred tax assets were fully reserved  except for a  and  benefit  respectively  expected to be available to offset foreign tax liabilities in the future 
the provision for income taxes for each of the years ended december  and primarily related to foreign income taxes 
seasonality our product revenue has tended to be seasonal 
in our third quarter  we have historically benefited from the federal government s fiscal year end purchasing activity 
this increase has been partially offset by european sales  which have tended to decline significantly in the summer months due to vacation practices in europe and the resulting delay in capital purchase activities until the fall 
we have historically generated a significant portion of our product revenue in the fourth quarter due to increased activity in europe  coupled with north american enterprise customers who operate on a calendar year budget and often wait until the fourth quarter to make their most significant capital equipment purchases 
we expect this historical trend of a lower portion of our annual revenue in the first half of the year and a more significant portion of our annual revenue in the third and fourth quarters to continue in the timing of these transactions could materially affect our quarterly or annual product revenue 
quarterly timing of revenue on a quarterly basis  we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of the quarter 
we believe this occurs for two reasons 
first  many customers wait until the end of the quarter to extract favorable pricing terms from their vendors  including sourcefire 
second  our sales personnel  who have a strong incentive to meet quarterly sales targets  have tended to increase their sales activity as the end of a quarter nears  while their participation in sales management review and planning activities are typically scheduled at the beginning of a quarter 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents used in provided by operating activities provided by used in investing activities provided by financing activities increase net cash at beginning of period net cash at end of period investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments operating activities 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  is the result of our net loss of million adjusted for million of net non cash revenues and expenses and changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulting in a net cash outflow of million 
receivables increased million during the year  primarily as a result of increased revenue in investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of maturities and sales of investments of million  offset by purchases of investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures includes million of capitalized costs associated with the implementation of our new erp system 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock based plans  partially offset by the repayment of capital lease obligations and the repurchase of common stock from terminated employees 
liquidity requirements we manufacture our products through contract manufacturers and other third parties 
this approach provides us with the advantage of relatively low capital investment requirements and significant flexibility in scheduling production and managing inventory levels 
the majority of our products are delivered to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers 
accordingly  our contract manufacturers are responsible for purchasing and stocking the components required for the production of our products  and they invoice us when the finished goods are shipped 
by leasing our office facilities  we also minimize the cash needed for expansion 
our capital spending is generally limited to leasehold improvements  computers  office furniture and product specific test equipment 
our short term liquidity requirements through december  consist primarily of working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
we expect to meet these short term requirements primarily through cash flow from operations 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet these requirements  we expect to fund these amounts through the use of existing cash and investment resources 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million and working capital of million 
as described above  our product sales are  and are expected to continue to be  highly seasonal 
we believe that our current cash reserves are sufficient for any short term needs arising from the seasonality of our business 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our operating leases 
we expect to meet these long term requirements primarily through cash flow from operations 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources  equity financing or debt financing to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than total one year years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments severance agreement we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply  we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon information provided by us 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
consequently  a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable and unconditional commitments 
as of december   we had total purchase commitments for inventory of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize substantially all of our revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
and sop no 
for each arrangement  we defer revenue recognition until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  such as a signed contract  delivery of the product has occurred and there are no remaining obligations or substantive customer acceptance provisions  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
we allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the fair value of each of the deliverables  determined based on vendor specific objective evidence 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for each of the deliverables  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which sufficient vendor specific objective evidence of fair value can be determined for any undelivered elements or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
however  if the only undelivered elements are elements for which we currently have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements based on the residual method 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our technical support based upon actual renewals of each type of technical support that is offered 
technical support and technical support renewals are currently priced based on a percentage of the list price of the respective product or software and historically have not varied from a narrow range of values in the substantial majority of our arrangements 
we defer and recognize revenue related to technical support ratably over the contractual period of the technical support arrangement  which is generally months 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of our other services is based on the price for these same services when they are sold separately 
we defer and recognize revenue for services that are sold either on a stand alone basis or included in multiple element arrangements as the services are performed 
changes in our judgments and estimates about these assumptions could materially impact the timing of our revenue recognition 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock based awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  except for certain option awards that contain market conditions relating to our stock price achieving specified levels  in which case we use a lattice option pricing model  for estimating the fair value of stock options granted and for employee stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  or the espp 
the use of option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term and the expected price volatility 
additionally  the recognition of expense requires the estimation of the number of options that will ultimately vest and the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the fair value of share based awards is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
effective october   we adjusted our estimated forfeiture rate for options from to per annum 
effective april   we adjusted our estimated forfeiture rate from to per annum for restricted stock grants 
we rely on historical experience of employee turnover to estimate our expected forfeitures 
the following are the assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation of stock options granted under our plans and employee stock purchases under the espp 
average risk free interest rate this is the average us treasury rate with a term that most closely resembles the expected life of the option for the quarter in which the option was granted 
expected dividend yield we have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
expected useful life this is the period of time that stock options granted under our option plans and employee purchases under the espp are expected to remain outstanding 
for stock options granted  this estimate is derived from the average midpoint between the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term as described in the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 share based payment  as amended by sab no 
in future periods  we expect to begin to incorporate our own data in estimating the expected life as we develop appropriate historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option 
for purchases under the espp  the expected useful life is the plan period 
expected volatility volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated historical volatility or is expected to fluctuate expected volatility during a period 
for stock options granted  given our limited historical stock data from our ipo in march  we have used a blended volatility to estimate expected volatility 
the blended volatility includes the average of our historical volatility from our ipo to the respective grant date and an average of our peer group historical volatility consistent with the expected life of the option 
our peer group historical volatility includes the historical volatility of companies that are similar in revenue size  in the same industry or are competitors 
we expect to continue to use a larger proportion of our historical volatility in future periods as we develop appropriate historical experience of our own stock price fluctuations considered in relation to the expected life of the option 
for purchases under the espp  we use our historical volatility since we have historical data available since our ipo consistent with the expected useful life 
during the third quarter of  we granted an option to purchase  shares of common stock to our new chief executive officer  which vests based on the price of our common stock achieving certain levels 
the lattice option pricing model was used for the valuation of this option because the valuation of this award cannot be reasonably estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the weighted average assumptions using the lattice option pricing model included a volatility of  an average risk free interest rate of  a dividend yield of and a strike price of 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the amount of expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in recent periods 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics that are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may be significantly different than the actual values upon the exercise  expiration  early termination  or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency between past and future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods  and assumptions 
stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options  nonvested stock  and employee stock purchases recognized under sfas no 
r for the year ended december  was million 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities recorded for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   and december   our deferred tax assets were fully reserved except for foreign deferred tax assets of  and  respectively  expected to be available to offset foreign tax liabilities in the future 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily related to foreign income taxes 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or fin fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the adoption of fin did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical write off experience  the need for specific customer reserves  the aging of our receivables  customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment cycle 
historically  our allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate based on actual results 
if any of the factors used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts change or if it does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories 
inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market  except for evaluation units which are stated at the lower of cost  on a specific identification basis  or market 
evaluation units are used for customer testing and evaluation and are predominantly located at the customers premises 
inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted demand is written down to its estimated net realizable value based on historical usage  expected demand  and age 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  as well as technological obsolescence of our products 
investments 
we account for investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we determine the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
our investments are comprised of money market funds  corporate debt investments  asset backed securities  commercial paper  government sponsored enterprises  government securities and certificates of deposit 
these investments have been classified as available for sale 
available for sale investments are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity are computed under the effective interest method 
such amortization is included in interest and investment income 
interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included in interest and investment income 
any other than temporary declines in fair value are recorded in earnings  and a new cost basis for the investment is established 
we evaluate our investments on a regular basis to determine whether an other than temporary decline in fair value has occurred 
this evaluation consists of a review of several factors  including  but not limited to the length of time and extent that an investment has been in an unrealized loss position  the existence of an event that would impair the issuer s future earnings potential  and our intent and ability to hold an investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
declines in value below cost for investments where it is considered probable that all contractual terms of the investment will be satisfied  is due primarily to changes in interest rates  and where we have the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery  are not assumed to be other than temporary 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp  which delays the effective date of sfas no 
by one year for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
for our financial assets and liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements  if any  from the adoption of sfas no 
 as it pertains to our non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which allows companies the option to measure financial assets or liabilities at fair value and include unrealized gains and losses in net income rather than equity 
we have elected not to adopt sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
sfas no 
r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas  including the treatment of contingent consideration  contingencies  acquisition costs  in process research and development and restructuring costs 
in addition  under sfas no 
r  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact income tax expense 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and we will adopt this standard on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  and accordingly there are no off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk nearly all of our revenue is derived from transactions denominated in us dollars  even though we maintain sales and business operations in foreign countries 
as such  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates  particularly the euro  british pound and yen  associated with operating expenses of  and cash held in  our foreign operations  but we believe this exposure to be immaterial at this time 
as we grow our international operations  our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling approximately million at december  the cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes while investments  made in accordance with our low risk investment policy  take advantage of higher interest income yields 
in accordance with our investment policy  we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities in which we invest  however  may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short and long term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
due to the nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
credit market risk we invest our cash in accordance with an established internal policy and in investments  comprised of money market funds  corporate debt investments  asset backed securities and commercial paper  that historically have been highly liquid and matured at their full par value 
however  as a result of the recent adverse conditions in the global credit markets  there is a risk that we may incur other than temporary impairment charges
