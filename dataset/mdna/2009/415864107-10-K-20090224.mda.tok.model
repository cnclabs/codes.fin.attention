overall  the global markets in which the company participates deteriorated in the fourth quarter of due to the financial and economic crisis 
to counteract this  the company initiated restructuring actions designed to improve organizational efficiency and enhance profitability and stockholder value by generating sustainable operating expense savings 
under this program  the company principally exited certain underperforming contracts with customers  closed certain facilities and reduced global workforce during the fourth quarter of the company anticipates that these actions will generate annualized savings of million in and beyond 
the cost associated with these actions in the fourth quarter of was million 
furthermore  the company continues to minimize its cost structure  with such actions as the redeployment of its mobile asset base in the harsco infrastructure and harsco metals segments to focus on market segments that remain strong and provide growth opportunities  the leansigma continuous improvement initiative and prudent reductions in capital spending 
the company believes its strong balance sheet and liquidity position as well as a lower cost structure put the company in a strong position to execute its long term strategic initiatives and take advantage of near term growth opportunities 
the company continues to have available liquidity and remains well positioned from a financial flexibility perspective 
the company successfully executed a million  year notes issue in the second quarter of  providing more financial flexibility and less exposure to variable interest rates

during  the company had record cash provided by operating activities of million  a increase over the million achieved in the company expects continued strong cash flows from operating activities in  however  is not expected to be as strong as additionally  in  the company invested a record million in capital expenditures over of which was for revenue growth projects 
more importantly  of the revenue growth capital expenditures were invested in emerging economies 
the company also repurchased approximately million shares during at a total cost of million 
the company s cash flows are further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 
segment overview the harsco infrastructure segment s revenues in were billion compared with billion in  a increase 
operating income increased by to million  from million in operating margins for the segment declined by basis points to from in operating margins declined partially due to pre tax restructuring costs of million related to severance  contract exit costs and asset disposals 
organic growth of was generated primarily in the middle east and asia pacific as these emerging economies continued to make significant investment in infrastructure modernization and expansion 
infrastructure maintenance activities  such as petrochemical and power plants  remained strong particularly in north america and northern europe 
harsco infrastructure accounted for of the company s revenues and of the operating income for the harsco metals segment s revenues in were billion compared with billion in  a increase 
operating income decreased by to million  from million in operating margins for this segment decreased by basis points to from in the decrease in operating income and margins was due to pre tax restructuring costs of million  higher fuel costs and unprecedented production cuts by steel mills across the globe  particularly in the fourth quarter restructuring charges primarily related to severance  contract exit costs  assets disposals and charges related to defined benefit pension plan changes 
this segment accounted for of the company s revenues and of the operating income for the all other category s revenues in were million compared with million in  a increase 
operating income increased by to million  from million in operating margins decreased by basis points to in from in primarily due to higher steel costs and lower volume and pricing in the minerals and recycling technologies business 
all six businesses contributed higher revenues due to strong demand 
four of the six businesses contributed higher operating income compared to this category accounted for of the company s revenue and of the operating income for despite the significant strengthening of the us dollar during the fourth quarter of  the effect of foreign currency translation increased full year consolidated revenues by million and pre tax income by million when compared with if the us dollar remains at current strong levels or strengthens further  results will be significantly negatively impacted 
outlook overview the company s operations span several industries  products and end markets as more fully discussed in part i  item  business 
on a macro basis  the company is affected by non residential and infrastructure construction and infrastructure maintenance and capital improvement activities  worldwide steel mill production and capacity utilization  industrial production volume and maintenance activity  and the general business trend towards the outsourcing of services 
the overall outlook for is guarded as a result of the deepening global financial and economic crisis that has created tremendous uncertainty and volatility throughout the world 
additionally  the company s pension plans assets declined in value consistent with the weakening economy and will result in significant increased pension expense during the significant strengthening of the us dollar in the fourth quarter of  and its continued appreciation in the first quarter of  is expected to have a significant adverse impact on the company s performance 
in response to these events  the company undertook a restructuring action during the fourth quarter of that is expected to generate annual savings of approximately million in and beyond 
the costs associated with these actions were million 
the company does not currently expect to incur any significant restructuring charges during  although the company continues to proactively and aggressively implement a number of additional countermeasures designed to improve future financial performance 
these additional actions include targeted reductions in capital spending  executing leansigma continuous improvement initiatives  and redeploying equipment from slowing markets into strategically important  growing markets 
additionally  the all other category harsco minerals rail is expected to benefit from declining steel prices in the current economic conditions provide the company with expansion opportunities to pursue its prudent acquisition strategy of seeking further accretive bolt on acquisitions 
the long term outlook across the global footprint of the harsco infrastructure business remains positive 
the near term outlook however  is challenging due to the current economic and financial crisis 
this segment will leverage its global breadth and mobile asset base to relocate equipment to focus on emerging markets as well as market segments that remain stable such as infrastructure maintenance services  and institutional services such as hospitals and education  and global infrastructure work 
operating performance for this segment in the long term is expected to continue to benefit from the execution of numerous global government stimulus packages which are expected to fund much needed infrastructure projects throughout the world  selective strategic investments and acquisitions in existing and new markets  and enterprise business optimization opportunities including new technology applications  consolidated procurement and logistics  and leansigma continuous improvement initiatives 
the long term outlook for the harsco metals segment remains stable as the global steel market is expected to grow at reasonable rates over the next several years 
the key factor behind this anticipated growth is the demand from emerging economies for significant infrastructure development needs 
the near term outlook  however  is challenging due to the deepening global economic and financial crisis which has caused reductions in demand for steel and associated steel production 
steel mill production declines reached unprecedented levels at the end of reduced production volumes are expected to continue into the first half of it is expected that some of this impact will be mitigated by substantially lower fuel costs  improved contract performance  new contract signings  and other cost optimization initiatives the company is currently implementing 
additionally  to ensure the segment will operate at optimal efficiency in and beyond  significant restructuring actions were executed during the fourth quarter of the recent decline in oil prices  if sustained  should have a measurable effect on operating results in the segment in the company continues to engage in enterprise business optimization initiatives including introducing the leansigma continuous improvement program  which over time is expected to result in broad scale improvement in business practices and consequently operating margin 
in addition  new contract signings and start ups  as well as the company s geographic expansion strategy  particularly in emerging markets  are expected to gradually have a positive effect on results in the longer term 
for the all other category harsco minerals rail  the long term outlook remains positive 
most end market demand remains strong and backlogs continue near record levels for the category 
the near term outlook however  for the minerals business  which recovers and recycles high value metals  has been negatively affected by the recent steep decline in metal prices 
the company continues to experience strong bidding activity in its railway track maintenance services and equipment business  new contract opportunities for its minerals and recycling technologies business  and potential geographic expansion opportunities within its industrial products businesses

highlights the following significant items affected the company overall during in comparison with company wide overall stronger demand benefited the company in the first three quarters of  in particular  increased infrastructure maintenance services and highly engineered equipment rentals  especially in the middle east and eastern europe  as well as railway track equipment sales and increased demand for air cooled heat exchangers 
operating income and margins for the harsco metals segment were negatively impacted by unprecedented declines in global steel production during the fourth quarter of  costs of restructuring actions implemented in the fourth quarter of  increased operating expenses  mainly higher fuel costs  as well as certain contracts with lower than acceptable margins 
harsco infrastructure segment dollars in millions revenues operating income operating margin percent harsco infrastructure segment significant impacts on revenues in millions revenues net increased volume and new business impact of foreign currency translation acquisitions revenues harsco infrastructure segment significant impacts on operating income in  the segment s operating results continued to improve due to increased non residential  and infrastructure construction throughout the world  and in particular the middle east  asia pacific and certain parts of europe 
the company continues to benefit from its highly engineered rental equipment capital investments made in both developed and emerging markets 
additionally  infrastructure maintenance activity remained strong in both north america and certain parts of western europe 
this segment benefited from million of increased pretax net gain on the sale of properties during compared with the impact of foreign currency translation in increased operating income for this segment by million  compared with in  the segment s operating results included million of costs related to the fourth quarter restructuring actions and increased costs associated with new business optimization initiatives and further process and technology standardization

operating income for included higher severance and other restructuring charges of million related to the fourth quarter restructuring actions 
the acquisition of alexander mill services international amsi was accretive to earnings in the impact of foreign currency translation in increased operating income for this segment by million compared with all other category harsco minerals rail dollars in millions revenues operating income operating margin percent all other category harsco minerals rail significant impacts on revenues in millions revenues railway track maintenance services and equipment air cooled heat exchangers industrial grating products acquisitions roofing granules and abrasives boiler and process equipment impact of foreign currency translation reclamation and recycling services revenues all other category harsco minerals rail significant effects on operating income the railway track maintenance services and equipment business delivered increased income in compared with due to increased rail equipment sales and repair parts  partially offset by reduced contract services sales and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
strong demand in the natural gas market resulted in increased volume and operating income for the air cooled heat exchangers business in these increases were partially offset by increased costs principally due to overall higher steel costs in the industrial grating products business experienced higher sales as a result increased pricing  however  operating income increases were partially offset by higher costs principally due to overall higher steel costs in despite lower volume for the roofing granules and abrasives business in  sales and operating income increased due to price increases  which were partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income for the boiler and process equipment business was higher in due to increased demand  partially offset by increased production costs and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income for the reclamation and recycling services was lower in due principally to unprecedented fourth quarter steel mills production declines and a significantly lower metal prices and product mix 
the impact of foreign currency translation in decreased operating income by million for this category compared to outlook  trends and strategies company wide adverse economic conditions precipitated by developments in the financial markets in the united states have created tremendous uncertainty and anxiety throughout the world 
the erosion in confidence in the financial markets  the global recession and the soaring us dollar have caused the company s near term prospects to become more difficult 
during the fourth quarter of there was an unprecedented reduction in global steel production as well as the postponement of some construction projects and sales due to the tightening of credit 
in addition  the value of the us dollar strengthened significantly against many other currencies  including the major currencies in key markets of the company 
the year is expected to be a very challenging year  particularly in the first half 
the major challenges facing the company include the following overall instability of the global financial markets and economies continuing strengthening of the us dollar tightening of credit markets that limit the ability of the company s customers to obtain financing substantial and unprecedented reductions in global steel production depressed commodity prices  particularly high value metals in response to this global financial and economic crisis  the company has and will continue to proactively and aggressively implement a number of countermeasures to reinforce performance  including during the fourth quarter of  the company implemented a restructuring program designed to improve organizational efficiency and enhance profitability and stockholder value 
under the restructuring program  the company is principally exiting certain underperforming contracts with customers  closing certain facilities  and reducing its global workforce 
the extent of the restructuring program increased from previously announced estimates to include additional actions taken as the global financial and economic crisis continued to deepen 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the restructuring program  or approximately per diluted share 
the annualized benefits associated with this charge are estimated to be million  or approximately per diluted share  and are expected to be realized in and beyond 
cutting costs across the enterprise  including reducing or eliminating discretionary spending to match market conditions 
prudently reducing growth capital expenditures in while redeploying equipment from slowing markets to new projects in strategically important areas such as the middle east and africa  asia pacific  and several other key countries 
accelerating growth initiatives  including projects in emerging markets 
selective  prudent strategic acquisitions 
while the global economic conditions remain uncertain and turbulent  the company believes it is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities and execute strategic initiatives based upon its strong balance sheet  available liquidity and its ability to generate strong operating cash flows 
the company is confident that the previously mentioned actions along with its new leansigma continuous improvement program will significantly reduce the company s cost structure further enhancing its financial strength 
additionally  the company s global footprint  diversity of services and products  long term mill services contracts  portability of infrastructure services equipment  and large infrastructure services customer base help mitigate its overall exposure to changes in any one single economy 
however  further deterioration of the global economies could still have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
looking to and beyond  the following significant items  trends and strategies are expected to affect the company the company will continue its disciplined focus on expanding its industrial services businesses  with a particular emphasis on prudently growing the harsco infrastructure segment  especially in emerging economies and other targeted markets 
growth is expected to be achieved through the provision of additional services to existing customers  new contracts in both developed and emerging markets  and selective strategic bolt on acquisitions 
additionally  new higher margin service and sales opportunities in the minerals and rail businesses will be pursued globally 
the company will continue to invest in selective strategic acquisitions and growth capital investments  however  management will continue to be very selective and disciplined in allocating capital  choosing projects with the highest economic value added eva potential 
the company anticipates global government stimulus packages to fund much needed infrastructure projects throughout the world 
the harsco infrastructure segment is well positioned with its engineering and logistics expertise and the capital investment base to take advantage of these expected opportunities 
the implementation of the company s enterprise wide leansigma continuous improvement program in should provide long term benefits and improve the overall performance of the company through a reduced cost structure and increased efficiency 
in addition to leansigma  the company will continue to implement enterprise wide business optimization initiatives to further enhance margins for most businesses 
these initiatives include improved supply chain and logistics management  capital employed optimization  and added emphasis on global procurement 
the company will place a strong focus on corporate wide expansion into emerging economies in the coming years to better balance its geographic footprint 
more specifically  within the next three to five years  the company s global growth strategies include steady  targeted expansion in the middle east and africa  asia pacific and latin america to further complement the company s already strong presence throughout western europe and north america 
this strategy is expected to result in a significant increase to the company s presence in these markets to approximately of total company revenues over the next three years and closer to in the longer term 
revenues in these markets were almost for compared with for in the long term  the improved geographic footprint will also benefit the company as it further diversifies its customer base 
volatility in energy and commodity costs eg  crude oil  natural gas  steel  etc 
and worldwide demand for these commodities could have an adverse impact on the company s operating costs and ability to obtain the necessary raw materials 
cost increases could result in reduced operating income for certain products and services  to the extent that such costs cannot be passed on to customers 
cost decreases could result in increased operating income to the extent that such cost savings do not need to be passed to customers 
however  increased volatility in energy and commodity costs may provide additional service opportunities for the harsco metals segment and several businesses in the all other category harsco minerals rail as customers may tend to outsource more services to reduce overall costs 
such volatility may also provide opportunities for additional petrochemical plant maintenance and capital improvement projects 
as part of the enterprise wide optimization initiatives discussed above  the company is implementing programs to help mitigate these costs 
foreign currency translation had an overall minor favorable effect on the company s sales and operating income during in comparison with however  due to the strengthening of the us dollar near the end of the third quarter of and through the fourth quarter  foreign currency translation had an overall unfavorable impact on the company s stockholders equity and is expected to have a significant negative impact on sales and earnings in relationship to if the us dollar continues to strengthen which it has through mid february  particularly in relationship to the euro  british pound sterling or the eastern european currencies  the impact on the company would generally be negative in terms of reduced revenue  operating income and stockholders equity 
additionally  even if the us dollar remains at its current value  the company s revenue and operating income will be negatively impacted in comparison to should the us dollar weaken in relationship to these currencies  the effect on the company would generally be positive in terms of higher revenue  operating income and stockholders equity 
despite the tightening of credit during the second half of the year and slightly higher borrowing rates during that time overall variable borrowing rates for have been lower than a one percentage point change in variable interest rates would change interest expense by approximately million per year 
this is substantially lower than prior projected impacts as variable rate debt has been reduced to approximately of the company s borrowings as of december   compared to approximately at december  this decrease is due to the repayment of commercial paper borrowings during the second quarter of with the proceeds from the may us senior notes offering coupled with strong operating cash flows in the company manages the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt to preserve adequate funding flexibility  as well as control the effect of interest rate changes on consolidated interest expense 
strategies to further reduce related risks are under consideration 
total defined benefit pension expense for will be substantially higher than the level due to the decline in pension asset values during the second half of this decline was due to the financial crisis and the deterioration of global economic conditions 
in an effort to mitigate a portion of this overall increased cost for  the company implemented additional plan design changes for a certain international defined benefit pension plan so that accrued service is no longer granted for periods after december  this action was part of the company s overall strategy to reduce pension expense and volatility 
as the company continues the strategic expansion of its global footprint and implements tax planning opportunities  the effective income tax rate has been lower than the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was for  compared with for the decrease in the effective income tax rate for the year was primarily due to increased earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates  increased designation of certain international earnings as permanently reinvested  and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits in certain state and foreign jurisdictions 
looking forward into the effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 
the company expects continued strong cash flows from operating activities in  however  is not expected to be as strong as the record cash flows 
the company plans to significantly reduce the amount of cash invested for organic growth capital expenditures during the company s growth capital expenditures were approximately million in the company expects growth capital expenditures to approximate million during the company believes that the mobile nature of its capital investment pool will facilitate strategic growth initiatives in the near term  despite the reduction in growth capital expenditures for harsco infrastructure segment the strong us dollar will continue to adversely affect sales and operating income of harsco infrastructure  as approximately of this business operates outside the us the near term outlook for the harsco infrastructure segment will be negatively impacted by continued uncertainty in the global credit markets  which has deferred equipment sales and some construction projects 
the current weakness in the commercial construction market  particularly in western europe and the united states  is being partially offset by a steady level of activity from the company s infrastructure maintenance services  institutional and global infrastructure projects  and continued overall growth in the middle east 
the company will continue to emphasize prudent expansion of its geographic presence in this segment through entering new markets and further expansion in emerging economies  and will continue to leverage its value added services and highly engineered forming  shoring and scaffolding systems to grow the business 
the company will continue to diversify this business  focusing on growth in institutional and global infrastructure projects and infrastructure maintenance projects 
the company will continue to implement its leansigma continuous improvement program and other key initiatives including global procurement and logistics  the sharing of engineering knowledge and resources  optimizing the business under one standardized administrative and operating model at all locations worldwide  and on going analysis for other potential synergies across the operations 
operating performance for this segment in the long term is expected to benefit from the execution of global government stimulus packages which should fund much needed infrastructure projects throughout the world 
harsco metals segment the strong us dollar will continue to adversely affect the sales and operating income of harsco metals  as over of this business operates outside the us adverse economic uncertainties developing through the third and fourth quarters of have resulted in reduced demand for steel  causing steel companies globally to significantly scale back production 
mills have also been accelerating planned maintenance outages in an effort to better balance production and end market demand 
these customer actions had a significant negative impact on the harsco metals segment s results in the fourth quarter of entering  the company continues to see this segment s operations running at even lower capacity than december while global demand for steel remains weak  steel production cuts of this depth and breadth are not expected to be sustainable for long periods of time 
the company does not foresee any measurable pick up in this segment s operations until the second half of benefits from the restructuring program implemented in the fourth quarter of should improve the operational efficiency and enhance profitability of the harsco metals segment in and beyond 
initiatives included the exit of underperforming contracts with customers and underperforming operations  defined benefit pension plan design changes  overall reduction in global workforce  and substantially reducing discretionary spending 
the company will continue to place significant emphasis on improving operating margins of this segment 
margin improvements are most likely to be achieved as a result of the recent decline in fuel costs  cost reduction initiatives  renegotiating or exiting contracts with lower than acceptable returns  principally in north america  internal enterprise business optimization efforts  divesting low margin product lines  continuing to execute a geographic expansion strategy in the middle east and africa  latin america and asia pacific  and implementing continuous improvement initiatives including leansigma projects  global procurement initiatives  site efficiency programs  technology enhancements  maintenance best practices programs and reorganization actions 
although the costs associated with these efforts have reduced operating margins during when compared with due to incremental costs  the overall margin enhancements are expected to be recognized in the second half of and beyond 
the company will continue to diversify its customer base by reallocating assets to new customers in emerging markets 
further consolidation in the global steel industry is possible 
should additional consolidations occur involving some of the steel industry s larger companies that are customers of the company  it would result in an increase in concentration of revenues and credit risk for the company 
if a large customer were to experience financial difficulty  or file for bankruptcy protection  it could adversely impact the company s income  cash flows and asset valuations 
as part of its credit risk management practices  the company closely monitors the credit standing and accounts receivable position of its customer base 
further consolidation may also increase pricing pressure on the company and the competitive risk of services contracts which are due for renewal 
conversely  such consolidation may provide additional service opportunities for the company as the company believes it is well positioned competitively 
arcelormittal recently notified the company that it would unilaterally revise the fixed fee provisions of certain contracts between the parties with the intended effect resulting in a significant price reduction to the company 
the company has notified arcelormittal that their actions are a breach of these contracts and that the company will take all necessary and appropriate actions to protect its legal rights 
discussions between the parties continue  but it is possible that the parties may need to resort to third party resolution of this issue 
arcelormittal represented approximately of the company s sales in  and the company expects arcelormittal sales in to be less than of the company s sales due primarily to reduced steel production levels  the company s exiting of certain underperforming contracts with arcelormittal  and a stronger us dollar 
it is possible that the eventual outcome of this unprecedented breach of contract could negatively impact the company s long term relationship with this customer and  as a result  the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 
of all of the company s major customers in the harsco metals segment  the eva on contracts with arcelormittal are the lowest in the portfolio 
contracts with arcelormittal are long term contracts  such that any impact on the company s future results of operations would occur over a number of years 
all other category harsco minerals rail the company will emphasize prudent global expansion of its reclamation and recycling value added services for extracting high value metallic content from slag and responsibly handling and recycling residual materials 
low metal prices and historical low production levels will continue to have a negative effect on certain reclamation and recycling services in  which may adversely affect the revenues  operating income  cash flows and asset valuations of this business 
certain businesses in this category are dependant on a small group of key customers 
the loss of one of these customers due to competition or due to financial difficulty  or the filing for bankruptcy protection could adversely impact the company s income  cash flows and asset valuations 
as part of its credit risk management practices  the company closely monitors the credit standing and accounts receivable position of its customer base 
international demand for the railway track maintenance services and equipment business s products and services is expected to be strong in both the near term and the long term 
a large multi year equipment order signed in with china is an example of the underlying strength of the international markets 
due to long lead times  this order is expected to generate most of its revenues during through in addition  increased volume of contract services and leansigma continuous improvement initiatives are expected to improve margins on a long term basis 
worldwide supply and demand for steel and other commodities could have an adverse impact on raw material costs and the ability to obtain the necessary raw materials for several businesses in this category 
the company has implemented certain strategies to help ensure continued product supply to its customers and mitigate the potential impact that changes in steel and other commodity prices could have on operating income 
if steel or other commodity costs associated with the company s manufactured products increase and the costs cannot be passed on to the company s customers  operating income would be adversely affected 
conversely  reduced steel and other commodity costs would improve operating income to the extent such savings do not have to be passed to customers 
additionally  if the company cannot obtain the necessary raw materials for its manufactured products  then revenues  operating income and cash flows could be adversely affected 
operating margins of the abrasives business could be impacted by volatile energy prices that affect both production and transportation costs 
this business continues to pursue cost and site optimization initiatives and the use of more energy efficient equipment to help mitigate future energy related increases 
due to a stable natural gas market and additional north american opportunities  demand for air cooled heat exchangers is expected to remain at least consistent with levels
