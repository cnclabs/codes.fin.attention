item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  appearing in item of this report 
also  several of the matters discussed in this document contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements usually are denoted by words or phrases such as believes  expects  projects  estimates  anticipates  will likely result or similar expressions 
we wish to caution readers that all forward looking statements are necessarily speculative and not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made  and to advise readers that actual results could vary due to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
factors associated with the forward looking statements that could cause the forward looking statements to be inaccurate and could otherwise impact our future results are set forth in detail in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare our financial statements included in item of this report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns  doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when we have evidence of an arrangement  a determinable fee  and when collection is considered to be probable and products are delivered  this occurs upon shipment of the merchandise  which is when legal transfer of title occurs 
reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns 
sales returns for the years ended december  and aggregated  and  respectively 
the allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at december  aggregated  we review the actual sales returns and bad debts for our customers and establish an estimate of future returns and allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory  consisting principally of products held for resale  is recorded at the lower of cost determined using the first in first out method or estimated market value 
we had inventory balances in the amount of  at december   which is presented net of valuation allowances of  we evaluate inventories to identify excess  high cost  slow moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins 
due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories 
if our assumptions about future demand change  or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 

table of contents our worldwide operations are subject to local laws and regulations 
as such  of particular interest is the european union eu directive relating to the restriction of certain hazardous substance rohs 
on july   this directive restricted the distribution of products within the eu containing certain substances  including lead 
at the present time  much of our inventory contains substances prohibited by the rohs directive 
further  many of our suppliers are not yet supplying rohs compliant products 
the legislation is effective and some of our inventory has become obsolete 
management has estimated the impact of the legislation and have written down or reserved for related inventories based on amounts expected to be realized given all available current information 
actual amounts realized from the ultimate disposition of related inventories could be different from those estimated 
deferred taxes we review the nature of each component of our deferred income taxes for reasonableness 
if determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which allowance will be charged to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
we also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and future taxable income in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
we also consider the weight of both positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance is needed 
however  due to the continued net losses  we have fully reserved a  allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of january   and have analyzed filing positions in each of the federal and state jurisdictions where required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
we have identified the us federal and california as our major tax jurisdictions 
generally  we remain subject to internal revenue service examination of our through us federal income tax returns  and remain subject to california franchise tax board examination of our through california franchise tax returns 
however  we have certain tax attribute carryforwards which will remain subject to review and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes are utilized 
we believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to fin in addition  we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of fin our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with income based tax audits is to record such items as a component of income taxes 
recent accounting policies in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
this statement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  on december  the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position fsp sfas b fsp b  which partially delays the effective dates of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those years 
management does not expect this statement will have a material impact on its financial statements upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which is an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented  thus requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both parent and the noncontrolling interest 
this statement is effective for the fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  management is currently assessing the impact that sfas no 
will have on its financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
this statement replaces fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
this statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas that the acquisition method of accounting which sfas called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
this statement defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control 
this statement requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  management does not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a significant impact on its financial statements 
in november  the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force eitf consensus on issue no 
 equity method investment accounting considerations eitf which addresses certain effects of sfas nos 
r and on an entity s accounting for equity method investments 
the consensus indicates  among other things  that transaction costs for an investment should be included in the cost of the equity method investment and not expensed and shares subsequently issued by the equity method investee that reduce the investor s ownership percentage should be accounted for as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment  with gains or losses recorded through earnings 
eitf is effective for us on transactions occurring after december  we do not expect this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption 
overview we distribute discrete semiconductors  optoelectronic devices and passive components to other electronic distributors  cems and oems  who incorporate them in their products and supply odm products for our customer s multi year turn key projects 
we continue to be impacted by the severe decline in demand for discrete semiconductors from the us market  which began in late as a result  we have experienced declining sales is such components since early in response to this declining demand  we placed emphasis on increasing our sales to existing customers through further expansion of the number of different types of discrete components and other integrated circuits in our inventory and by attracting additional contract electronic manufacturers cems  original equipment manufacturers oems and electronics distributor customers 
in addition  over the last three years we have developed our odm service capabilities and added products developed through partnership agreements with offshore solution providers oems and cems 
we now offer commodity integrated circuits ics as an extension of current discrete semiconductor lines in our core strategy still includes maintaining a substantial inventory of electronic components that allows us to fill customer orders immediately from stock held in inventory 
however  since demand remained weak throughout  we continue to focus on lowering our inventory balances and changing our product mix 
as a result  net inventory levels decreased throughout the year by  including a non cash provision of approximately  during to increase our inventory reserves for price declines  non rohs compliant components and slow moving inventory 
this provision is mainly used to increase our inventory reserve to account for slow moving and excess inventory 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have classified inventory as a current asset in our december   consolidated financial statements representing approximately of current assets and of total assets 
however  if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated  the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset  such as cash 
we cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve 
therefore  it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result 
our gross profit margins are subject to a number of factors  including product demand  the relative strength of the us dollar  provisions for inventory reserves  our ability to purchase inventory at favorable prices and our sales product mix 
results of operations the year ended december  compared to the year ended december net sales were  and  in and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to a domestic decline in demand for our electronic discrete  passive and opto component products which overall declined by  as compared to  partially offset primarily by increase in sales for our ics and odm products which combined increased by  as compared with 
table of contents gross margins were  and  in and  respectively  which represented and of net sales for those periods 
the increase of  was primarily attributed to the decrease of our provision for inventory reserves by  when comparing  or of net sales in with  or of net sales in the selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  in and  respectively  which represented and of net sales for those periods 
the decrease of  was primarily due to decreases in salaries and benefits expenses by  and rent expenses by  operating losses were  and  in and  respectively  which represented and of net sales for those periods 
operating losses decreased primarily as a result of higher gross margins discussed above related to declines in our provision for inventory reserves 
net interest expense was  and  income for and  respectively 
the decrease was due to lower cash on hand levels during the year 
income tax provision was  and  in and  respectively 
our tax provision is primarily based upon our state income tax liabilities 
we incurred net losses of  and  in and  respectively  which represented and of net sales for those periods 
the losses are primarily due lower margins discussed above and related to provisions for our inventory reserves 
liquidity and capital resources we historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations  short term commercial loans  subordinated promissory notes and issuance of equity securities 
a summary of our cash flows resulting from our operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities increased to  during  as compared to  used in the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily attributed to accounts receivable and inventory decreasing by  and  respectively  during  as compared to increasing by  and  respectively  during cash flows used in investing activities decreased to  during  as compared to  in the prior year 
our investing outflows of  came from acquisitions of property and equipment  compared with  in our remaining outflows of  primarily came from investments in marketable securities  real estate construction expenses and joint ventures 
cash flows provided by financing activities were  in as compared to  used in the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by financing was primarily attributed to reducing our cash dividend of  in  compared with  in the prior year and the borrowing of  in notes payable during we believe that funds generated from operations  existing cash balances and short term loans  are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
if these funds are not sufficient  we may secure new sources of asset based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities 
otherwise  we may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital 
inventory is included and classified as a current asset 
as of december   inventory represented approximately of current assets and of total assets 
however  it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not to be saleable within a one year time frame 
hence  inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets  such as cash 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we had no material off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are likely to have  a current or future material effect on our operations
