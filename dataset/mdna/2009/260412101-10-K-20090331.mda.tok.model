we disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward looking statements 
the company we are a leading specialty retailer and the largest direct marketer of premium equestrian products in the us for over years  dover saddlery has been a premier upscale brand in the english style riding industry 
we sell our products through a multi market channel strategy  including direct and retail 
this multi market channel strategy has allowed us to use catalogs and our proprietary database of over two million names of equestrian enthusiasts as a primary marketing tool to increase catalog sales and to drive additional business to our e commerce websites and retail stores 
we offer a comprehensive selection of products required to own  train and compete with a horse  selling from under to over  our equestrian product line includes a broad variety of separate items  such as saddles  tack  specialized apparel  footwear  horse clothing  horse health and stable products 
separate reporting of the revenues of these numerous items is not practical 
we have historically focused on the english style riding market 
dover is known for providing the highest quality products for english style riding  including premier brands such as hermes  ariat  grand prix  mountain horse  passier and prestige 
we offer what we believe is the largest selection of exclusive and semi exclusive equestrian products in the industry 
to further broaden our offerings  we began selling into the western style riding market in under the smith brothers name 
our management team is highly experienced in both the direct and retail channels with an average of more than years of equestrian experience 
since stephen day acquired an ownership interest in dover and joined as our president and chief executive officer  he and the rest of the management team have grown annual revenues from million to million from through prior to joining dover  mr 
day was responsible for building the only other national english style equestrian products direct marketing and retail company  state line tack 
we have positioned ourselves to capitalize on the synergies of adding a retail market channel to our direct market channel  consisting of catalogs and the internet 
by marketing our products across integrated  multiple shopping channels  we have strengthened our brand visibility and brand equity  expanded our customer database and increased revenues  profits and market share 
while our catalog has been our primary marketing vehicle to increase internet and store traffic  each of our channels has reinforced the other and generates additional customers 

table of contents through our subsidiaries  as of december   we operated eleven retail stores under the dover saddlery brand and one retail store under the smith brothers brand 
we have identified additional market locations throughout the us  which we believe are attractive for our planned retail store expansion and can allow us to capitalize on the highly fragmented nature of the retail equestrian products market and to take advantage of our strong brand name recognition 
these additional locations have been identified using our proprietary mathematical store optimization model  which selects the locations nationwide with the strongest potential and optimizes distances between stores to enhance revenue potential 
our initial targets are based on an optimization model of locations  each utilizing one of three different store formats  depending on the location and revenue potential of the area 
we believe that our proprietary mathematical store optimization model assists us in locating potential retail sites and gives us a competitive advantage in finding optimal new store locations 
based on our experience to date with opening new retail stores in areas where we have a high level of existing direct customers  as well as the experience of other multi channel retailers  we believe that expanding the number of retail store locations and focusing on our multi market channel strategy are keys to our continued success 
however  the significant challenges presented by the current uncertainty in the economic outlook have required us to place this long term expansion strategy on hold 
our mission is to grow our business by providing the most comprehensive offering of the highest quality  broadest range and most technically advanced equestrian tack  specialized apparel  horse care and stable products to serious equestrians  with a profitable and efficient operating model 
our history dover was founded in by jim and david powers who were top ranked english riding champions on the us equestrian team 
jim powers was also a member of the us olympic equestrian team 
the brothers aimed to bring their unique understanding of higher level equestrian competitive needs to better serve the industry s customers 
as a result of their focus on quality and premium positioning  dover saddlery has been a premier upscale brand in the english riding industry for over years 
the powers opened our wellesley  ma retail store in and began catalog operations in by  our revenues had grown to approximately million 
in september  stephen day  our current president and chief executive officer and a veteran of the equestrian products direct marketing industry  and certain other new investors took a controlling interest in dover 
we launched our main website  www 
doversaddlery 
com  in in  we moved our headquarters to littleton  ma  and into a  square foot warehouse and office facility 
our second retail location under the dover saddlery name was opened in hockessin  de in our management team identified the large western style equestrian market as a growth opportunity and  in  we acquired the smith brothers catalog and website  www 
smithbrothers 
com 
in  we also acquired rights in the miller s harness brand for use in catalog and internet sales to target entry level and lower cost equestrian products customers

in  we opened or converted four stores under the dover brand 
in  we opened two stores under the dover brand  and as of december   we operated eleven stores under the dover saddlery brand and one store under the smith brothers brand 

table of contents competitive strengths we believe that we are uniquely positioned in the equestrian tack  specialized apparel and horse care and stable products industry to grow through our multi market channel strategy 
we believe that we have numerous competitive strengths  including experienced management with a track record of growth and profitability we were founded in and have over years of operating history 
stephen day joined dover after successfully building and growing another equestrian products catalog and retailer  state line tack 
our management team has extensive experience in direct marketing and retail as well as an average of more than years of equestrian experience 
since stephen day became president and chief executive officer in  we have grown annual revenues from million to million 
established brand in english style riding equipment and apparel we are known for offering the highest quality products  the most comprehensive selection and excellent customer service 
since our founding over years ago  we have built a reputation with a large and growing following in the equestrian products marketplace 
dover saddlery is the only nationally recognized retail multi market channel brand in the english style equestrian products industry  and we believe our dover saddlery brand is a significant asset as we continue our retail store expansion and multi market channel growth strategy 
leading equestrian products retailer of quality tack with million in revenues from our two market channels  we believe we hold the largest market share among premium equestrian products retailers for equestrian tack and specialized equestrian apparel 
the dover saddlery catalog is known by many customers as a leading source for english style equestrian products and the smith brothers catalog is becoming a strong force in the western style riding market 
large  detailed customer database we believe that our proprietary database is one of the largest and most detailed in the industry 
the database contains customers who have purchased from us over the last years  including detailed purchasing history over the last years and demographic information of such customers  and the names and addresses of individuals who have requested our catalogs  as well as other individuals with equestrian interests 
this is a key competitive advantage and business planning tool 
it is also a barrier to entry since it could take years and could be very costly to duplicate 
successful multi market channel strategy our multi market channel strategy of using direct and retail market channels has enabled us to capture customer data  achieve operational synergies  provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience for our customers  cross market our products and reinforce our brand across channels 
through our sophisticated customer database  we have observed that multi market channel customers have bought  on average  nearly three times more products per year than single channel customers 
to date  we have successfully executed on our strategy with the addition of ten new stores bringing our dover branded retail store count to eleven and adding a single smith brothers branded retail store 
excellent customer service our company wide focus on exceptional customer service is integral to our success 
we promote a culture of prompt  knowledgeable and courteous service and strive for a consistent customer experience across both channels of purchase 
over of our customer service and sales representatives are horse enthusiasts 
additionally  our representatives receive ongoing product training from merchandise suppliers and internal product specialists 
we also have a policy of offering customers a satisfaction guarantee 
we believe that our well trained  knowledgeable staff and our historical ability to fill approximately of the items ordered within an average of business days in from our in stock inventory are some of the reasons why we have had historically low return rates and high repeat customer rates 

table of contents attractive customer demographics dover saddlery customers are primarily affluent females with a passion for the english style riding sport 
we believe them to be discerning  luxury oriented customers who often choose to buy from us because of the high quality offering and prestige of owning the premier brands 
based on demographic data available to us  we believe that more than two thirds of households that own horses have incomes above the national median household income of  our customer base has been very loyal as demonstrated by high repurchase rates 
significant barriers to entry we enjoy significant barriers to entry including substantial costs of developing a useful customer database  efficient merchandising and fulfillment infrastructure  breadth of product offering and in stock inventory levels  as well as the costs and time involved in building customer trust and brand recognition 
the investments we have made in our brand  our customer database and proprietary mathematical store optimization model and inventory replenishment set us apart from others in the industry 
highly fragmented equestrian products market the current marketplace for equestrian products is highly fragmented and mostly consists of small  one location tack shops 
there are approximately  different retailers in the us selling equestrian products 
although there are a number of places to find equestrian products  there are no large companies  other than dover saddlery  focused on the english style equestrian products market with any significant number of retail store locations since state line tack closed its retail operations in we bring a level of merchandising  marketing  on hand inventory and operational discipline that is unique in the industry 
we plan to apply these disciplines to confront the very significant competition that we face in each of our local markets 
broad and distinctive selection of high quality  need based products at competitive prices with rapid order fulfillment capability we have feature rich  need based  functional offerings encompassing virtually every product necessary to own  train and compete with a horse 
we differentiate ourselves from our competition by our vast breadth and depth of inventory 
we offer products ranging from entry level price points to the premium high end 
we carry premium brands  private label and non branded products to meet the broad range of customer expectations and needs 
because a percentage of our products are characterized as need based for the continued care of a horse  we believe that this contributes to a high degree of predictable buying patterns by our customers 
in addition to this  approximately of our products are non obsolescent items 
our large inventory has allowed us to ship approximately of the items ordered within an average of business days in we are also able to ship any product we offer to our retail stores on a rapid replenishment basis  effectively increasing our retail store inventory to match that of our littleton  ma warehouse 
this provides our customers with the ability to walk into any of our retail stores and access our entire product offering 
competitors who maintain only one or even a few stores are unable to match the breadth  depth and ready availability of our million in total inventory 
growth strategies having established ourselves as the largest direct marketer in the premium equestrian products market  we are continuing our strategy to capitalize on our strong brand equity  take advantage of our comprehensive customer database  achieve operational synergies  cross market products and provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience across channels 
we have observed that our multi market channel customers have bought  on average  nearly three times more product per year than single channel customers  and therefore  a multi market channel model is a key part of our strategy to grow our revenues  profits and market share 
our growth strategy includes several key components 
open dover saddlery retail stores in targeted locations as of december   we operated eleven dover saddlery branded stores targeted at the english style riding segment  and one 
table of contents smith brothers branded store targeted at the western style riding segment 
the equestrian products market is estimated at billion  yet no national  equestrian products specialty retail chains exist and there are only a limited number of small  regional  multi unit english equestrian products retailers 
we have identified locations throughout the us  which we believe are attractive for our retail store expansion and will allow us to capitalize on the highly fragmented nature of the retail equestrian products market and our strong brand name recognition 
these locations have been identified using our proprietary mathematical store optimization model  which selects the locations nationwide with the strongest potential and optimizes distances between stores to enhance revenue potential 
the model optimizes distances between stores with concentrations of current customers and recalibrates when actual stores are targeted and added 
our marketing efforts have provided detailed customer data regarding location and sales performance that has given us the ability to plan and perform extensive site analysis 
our initial targets are based on an optimization model of locations  each utilizing one of three different store formats  depending on the location and revenue potential of the area 
we believe that our proprietary mathematical store optimization model  which assists us in locating retail sites  will continue to give us a competitive advantage in finding attractive locations 
expand our direct market channel our catalog business drives traffic to our internet store and retail market channel 
we plan to expand our direct market channel business through initiatives to existing and new customers 
we seek to increase the number of customers and prospects that receive a catalog  increase the numbers of customers buying through both market channels  and increase the amount each customer spends for our merchandise through the continued introduction of new products 
we plan to continue to utilize web based opportunities with promotional  targeted e mails programs  refer a friend programs and on line search engines 
we intend to continue our practices of using banner advertising on qualified equestrian websites  of having links to and from qualified equestrian websites  and of sending prospect e mails to qualified equestrian e mail lists 
enhance our product mix we carry premium branded  private label and non branded equipment and accessories 
we believe we have the largest collection of exclusive and semi exclusive brands in the industry 
we continually seek to expand our product offering to meet the needs of our customers and will seek to expand and enhance our product mix to increase revenues and the profitability of the business 
currently we offer a broad selection of products under the dover and other trademarks 
we believe that these products offer a great value to our customers who have come to trust our quality 
expand further in the western style equestrian products market while it is difficult to track industry data  the number of western style riders is believed to be at least four times the number of english style riders in the us we entered the western style equestrian products market through our acquisition of smith brothers in  and opened a smith brothers retail store in we intend to expand our direct marketing  and eventually  our retail store presence in western style riding 
accomplishments in pursuit of our goals as the largest equestrian retailer of quality tack and specialty riding apparel  we accomplished the following in we opened two dover saddlery retail locations  one in alpharetta  ga and one in branchburg  nj we have acquired a interest in hobby horse  the largest western show clothing manufacturer we have arranged to acquire certain assets of the leading western show clothing retail brand  sargent s western world we continue to enhance and expand the dover saddlery product offering 
table of contents industry equestrian products market the north american market for equestrian tack  saddles  specialized apparel  grooming and healthcare products  horse clothing  equestrian related media and other horse supplies is estimated by the american horse council at billion for although studies on the equestrian industry are informal  according to the fountain agricounsel usa horse industry business report  in  the total industry sales for the markets we target were billion 
a american horse council survey estimated that there are million horses in the us according to american sports data  over of the us population  or million people  ride horses with an average of participating days per year  which exceeds participation in other popular outdoor sports  such as downhill skiing at and days and mountain biking at and days 
there are many indicators that point to the continued growth of the equestrian products industry 
a study by nfo research indicated that of us households are involved in riding  an additional were involved at one time and would like to become involved 
there has also been a recent increase in the number of nationally televised programs dedicated exclusively to the equestrian viewer  such as nbc s presentation of the rolex international day event held in lexington  kentucky and horsecity 
com tv 
the equestrian media network has also been gaining traction with national television stations  which is expected to help increase the popularity of the equestrian products industry even further 
there are very few dominant manufacturers and distributors  and no dominant retailers in the equestrian products industry  creating a highly fragmented market 
of the approximately  us equestrian products retailers  we believe that a majority of them are too small to develop multiple sales channels  deep inventories  automated inventory control systems  extensive customer databases and brand equity  and are therefore  unable to effectively control a significant portion of market share 
direct marketing direct marketing is a fast growing  dynamic industry that includes sales generated through direct mail and the internet 
sales generated through catalogs  both offline and on the internet  have grown at an annual rate of since total sales attributed to catalogs in the us reached billion in  and the direct marketing association dma projects they will grow to over billion by the dma projects annual growth of sales attributed to catalogs of  which will continue to outpace the overall projected retail sales growth of 
sales from catalog retailing grew rapidly during the s at an annual rate of approximately twice the rate of conventional retailing 
this growth was driven by several factors  including the emergence of strong direct marketing brands eg  dell computer  lands end  and ll bean  consumers busier lifestyles  due in part to the substantial increase in the number of professional women  and the recent introduction of specialty catalogs tailored to niche audiences combined with more sophisticated mailing and customer targeting techniques 
established catalogers enjoy significant barriers to entry including substantial costs of developing useful customer databases  efficient merchandising and fulfillment infrastructure and consumer trust and brand recognition 
the expense of acquiring  perfecting and maintaining an extensive and accurate customer database specific to each company s target market is expensive  and such a database can take years to build to levels competitive with established catalogs 
the internet is a key driver of targeting customers in our direct market channel 
industry research estimates that online sales in the us reached billion in this was an increase of from as the price of personal computing declines and americans become more technologically savvy  many are choosing to browse and buy over the internet 
moreover  an 
table of contents increasing number of internet users are turning to broadband service that allows faster  more convenient access to online shopping 
we believe that a large  highly fragmented industry with affluent  passionate horse enthusiasts presents us with the opportunity to use our reputation and multi market channel strategy to increase our market share and revenues in the future 
customers our english riding customers are primarily affluent females with a passion for the english riding sport 
we believe them to be discerning  luxury oriented customers who often choose to buy from us because of the high quality offering and prestige of owning the premier brands 
based on demographic data from the american horse council ahc  we believe that more than two thirds of households that own horses have incomes above the national median household income of  as reported by the us census 
our customer database provides for each customer a summary of the recency  frequency and monetary value of that customer s orders as well as a detailed listing of each item the customer has ordered for the past five years 
our customers have been very loyal as demonstrated by high repurchase rates 
our multi market channel strategy having established ourselves as the largest direct marketer of equestrian tack  specialized apparel  horse care and stable products in the us  we plan to continue our multi market channel retail strategy to capitalize on our strong brand equity and utilize our customer database 
this multi market channel strategy enables us to capture customer data  achieve operational synergies  provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience for our customers  cross market our products and reinforce our brand across channels 
we believe that our strategy is working 
through the data captured by our sophisticated customer database  we have determined that multi market channel customers buy  on average  nearly three times more product per year than customers who only purchase through a single channel 
this is supported by the experiences of other successful multi market channel retailers such as eddie bauer and jc penney 
eddie bauer s multi market channel customers spend  on average  approximately six times more than its single channel customers and jc penney s multi market channel customers spend  on average  approximately five times more than its single channel customers 
our multi market channel business model has several key elements our catalogs are targeted marketing tools which we use to generate customers  gather customer demographic data  increase the visibility of the dover saddlery and smith brothers brands  increase visits to the internet and drive traffic to our retail stores  utilize our large  information rich customer database to cross market our products  prospect for customers  forecast sales  manage inventory  tailor catalog mailings and plan for our retail store expansion  and use our proprietary mathematical store optimization model to target the strongest markets nationwide and optimize store spacing for our retail location selection 
based on the latest customer data and actual store openings  our proprietary software maps out the entire country with our catalog sales and extrapolates ideal locations for our stores such that we can capture the greatest density of potential customers 
the model is dynamic such that any change in a single location or number of total locations will impact site selection and estimated performance system wide 
based on research of other similar multi market channel concepts  we believe that  when mature  the natural channel balance of a multi channel retailer tends to stabilize with to of the sales coming from the retail market channel 
this retail purchasing preference on the part of 
table of contents consumers is even more pronounced in the equestrian industry 
research by frank n 
magid associates  inc indicates that of tack customers shop at retail stores 
since we currently have just under of our total revenues coming from retail stores  we believe that there is significant opportunity to continue to develop our multi market channel strategy and pursue our targeted retail store expansion 
see retail store operations and expansion 
our experience from the hockessin  de store has shown that within two years of opening  direct sales from customers within a mile radius of this store exceeded levels prior to its opening and led to sales of approximately compounded annual growth over the first two years of operation 
although our wellesley  ma store has been in operation for over years  we have maintained an impressive mix of both direct and retail store sales in the area 
the direct sales in the area surrounding the store demonstrate that even though we have a retail location  the convenience of multi channel shopping over the internet or by catalog has been appealing to our customers located within miles of the store 
we believe that this provides further support to the potential value created by opening up retail stores in areas that already have a strong customer base 
we seek to continually improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our multiple market channels through our integrated planning  order management  fulfillment systems and economies of scale in cross channel inventory processing and advertising 
we continuously strive to enhance our efficiencies to provide a seamless cross channel experience to our customers  and achieve greater profitability 
direct market channel since we mailed our first catalog in  we have grown our direct market channel to include three separate catalogs and three e commerce websites 
as we implement our plan to expand our retail stores  we expect our retail market channel to stimulate even greater demand for our products  and eventually outstrip the demand from our direct market channel 
however  the direct market channel will continue to be the core component of our brand identity and the driving force behind the customer data utilized to promote each of our market channels 
our direct market channel generated approximately million in revenues in or of our total company revenues 
of this amount  we generated approximately million in revenues from internet orders  or of total company revenues 
our proprietary database contains over two million names 
we expect this database to continue to grow as we open additional retail locations 
catalog we mail our catalogs to individuals who have made purchases during the past five years 
we also mail catalogs to new prospects obtained through our proprietary database of names we have compiled through sponsorships  trade associations  subscriber lists for equestrian publications  grassroots name gathering efforts  and outside rented lists 
we currently maintain two primary catalogs and a sales flier 
the dover saddlery catalog caters to the mid to high end english style equestrian products customer 
the smith brothers catalog is aimed at the western style equestrian products customer 
the miller s harness sales flier is used to reach the entry level and lower cost english style equestrian products customer 
catalogs are sent regularly throughout the year to a carefully selected circulation list 
we develop annually four distinct dover saddlery catalogs and four distinct smith brothers catalogs  including a large annual catalog for each line 

table of contents dover saddlery dover saddlery is the most comprehensive source for the english style equestrian products market 
in addition to the general catalog  the three targeted editions of the dover saddlery annual catalog specialize in the dressage  eventing and hunter jumper segments

com 
our internet revenues have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of from  our first full year of internet operations  to million or of total revenues in our websites are integral to our multi market channel strategy 
the websites reinforce our relationship with current catalog customers and are a growing source of new customers 
new customers acquired through the websites have historically been highly responsive to subsequent catalog mailings 
our websites feature our entire product offering and enable us to better market to our customers and visitors by allowing different pages to be automatically shown to different types of individuals 
this allows us to segment visitors into smaller  targeted groups  which in turn increases conversion rates 
visitors are able to shop by their riding style  providing them with images of their passion and products suited to their niche 

table of contents we plan to continue to utilize web based opportunities with promotional  targeted e mail programs  refer a friend programs  and online search engines  comparison shopping  engine and banner advertising 
retail store operations and expansion as of december   we operated eleven stores under the dover saddlery brand and one store under the smith brothers brand 
we intend to expand our retail store operations going forward  primarily under the dover saddlery brand as the economy improves 
however  we plan to be very opportunistic in and only open additional stores if the real estate costs are exceptionally attractive 
we expect a substantial reduction in retail store leasing costs and the availability of high quality real estate to improve dramatically in we therefore will be focusing our location efforts and lease negotiations on retail store locations dover saddlery new england plaistow  nh wellesley  ma mid atlantic hockessin  de crofton  md hunt valley  md branchburg  nj chantilly  va charlottesville  va lexington  va south alpharetta  ga dallas  tx smith brothers denton  tx our retail stores carry largely the same product mix as our catalogs and websites to promote convenience and shopping frequency 
the broad selection of retail product and the ready availability of inventory from our warehouse allow for superior customer service 
to the extent that a certain item is not physically available at a retail store  store personnel will work with the customer to ensure prompt in store or home delivery of the item  according to the customer s preference 
each store s mission is to foster loyalty and provide face to face answers to customers questions 
sales staff are carefully selected and trained to provide accurate and helpful product information to the customer 
in most cases  they are experienced equestrians 
new retail store model our proprietary mathematical store optimization model will help us select each store location by projecting sales based on real time catalog customer purchases surrounding the potential location 
our initial targeted locations will be positioned in key markets exhibiting the highest concentration of 
table of contents current direct sales customers and equestrian enthusiasts 
existing customers within the proposed locations are expected to support and accelerate the maturation curve of new stores 
prior experience with existing stores has demonstrated an increase in the number of catalog customers within stores trade areas 
dover store prototype we are developing three primary prototype store models for nationwide rollout a  b  and c 
a  to  square foot a store model assumes an average initial net investment of approximately million  including approximately  of pre opening costs and  of inventory 
as of december   we had four a stores 
a  to  square foot b store model assumes an initial investment of approximately million  including approximately  in pre opening expenses and  in inventory  and is projected to generate approximately the same level of sales per square foot as the a store model 
as of december   we had five b stores 
a c store model is currently in development and will be targeted to be a smaller footprint of approximately  square feet  filling in key markets as appropriate 
as of december   we had two c stores 
new stores may be established in existing leased space or newly constructed facilities 
our new construction stores will be designed in conjunction with morton buildings  a nationwide builder of upscale barns 
site optimization we have developed a proprietary mathematical store optimization model to select locations for new stores 
the model continuously optimizes distances between stores within concentrations of current customers and equestrian enthusiasts and recalibrates  as necessary  when actual stores are targeted and added 
our proprietary database and procedures in our direct market channel provide detailed customer data regarding location and sales performance  which give us a significant competitive advantage over other traditional equestrian products retailers 
this data  combined with our proprietary mathematical store optimization model  helps us accurately and effectively identify markets and target specific locations that maximize potential revenue out of selected markets 
once we identify an optimal location by zip code  extensive site analysis follows  including major highway access and real estate considerations  to enhance the profitability potential for our stores 
marketing our dover saddlery and smith brothers catalogs are our primary branding and advertising vehicles 
we believe our catalogs reinforce our brand image and drive sales in all of our market channels 
our direct market channel enables us to maintain a database of customer sales patterns and thus target segments of our customer base with specific marketing 
our customer database provides for each customer a summary of the recency  frequency and monetary value of that customer s orders as well as a detailed listing of each item the customer has ordered over the past five years 
depending on the spending habits we identify through our customer database  we send certain customers special catalog editions and or e mails 
we market our websites by the use of paid key words and augmented natural search 
we actively seek beneficial links and are currently linked from hundreds of equine websites 
banner advertising is presently placed on the leading equestrian content sites and we have an active refer a friend program 

table of contents other branding and advertising vehicles we employ include running print ads in local newspapers and trade magazines  sponsoring equestrian events and issuing press releases for major new product offerings 
we also offer a dover saddlery branded credit card operated by national city bank that allows our frequent customers to accumulate reward points that can be redeemed for discounts toward future purchases 
order processing and fulfillment a majority of our orders are received by telephone  but internet orders have rapidly increased since the introduction of our first website in we operate three customer service call centers located in littleton  ma  north conway  nh  and denton  tx 
all of our centers are linked to the same network and share a single customer database that includes a real time recency  frequency and monetary value summary for each customer as well as a direct link to each customer s line item order history over the last five years 
the order entry system is also directly linked to our inventory management system to ensure that product availability is real time 
our  square foot littleton  ma warehouse and office facility also serves as our fulfillment center 
inventory an additional way that we differentiate ourselves from our competition is through our breadth and depth of inventory 
we believe our inventory is deeper than our competitors  with million in on hand inventory as of december  with our extensive inventory position and rapid fulfillment capability  we have historically been able to fill approximately of the items ordered within an average of business days in based on our inventory management systems  continuous monitoring of the products we carry and the fact that we carry very few fashion products  we have historically had very little obsolete inventory 
despite the high level of inventory we have historically maintained  our goal is to turn warehouse inventory four times per year and we historically have had no material inventory write downs 
all of the products that are presented in our catalogs are available online and customers can use our websites to enter orders  shop online and check order status and inventory availability 
on average  our retail stores stock inventory items that represent over of the merchandise sales we make available through our direct market channel 
all items are available to customers entering our stores by either direct shipment to a customer s home or for in store pickup 
product mix and merchandising we offer feature rich  need based  functional products encompassing virtually every product necessary to own  train and compete with a horse 
we differentiate ourselves from our competition by our vast breadth and depth of product offerings 
we offer products ranging from entry level price points to the premium high end  and carry leading brands  niche brands and private label brands to meet the broad range of customer expectations and needs 
our product mix has been relatively consistent over the last five years 
we carry the premier names and the most comprehensive offering of the highest quality  broadest range and most technically advanced tack and related gear for serious equestrians 
the sales pattern for equestrian products is fairly consistent from year to year 
introductions of new fashions are generally limited  making sales per item more relatively predictable 
the low sku turnover reduces inventory obsolescence and overstock risks 
competition we compete based on offering a broad selection of high quality products at competitive prices and superior customer service with knowledgeable staff for our customers 
we believe that our annual direct sales and breadth of product offering are each over twice the size of our closest competitor 
we 
table of contents believe that we benefit from significant barriers to entry with our established dover saddlery brand and with what we believe to be the industry s most comprehensive database 
the retail market for equestrian products is highly fragmented with approximately  retail equestrian store locations nationwide 
there are no national retail chains 
moreover  only a few regional multi outlet stores compete in the market for equestrian products 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
due to buying patterns around the holiday season and a general slowdown during the later part of the summer months  our revenues are traditionally higher in the fourth quarter 
in fiscal  we generated of our annual revenues during the fourth quarter 
employees at december  we had employees  approximately were employed full time 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be good

risk factors 
an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider these risk factors before buying or trading shares of our stock 
any such risks may materialize  and additional risks not known to us  or that we now deem immaterial  may arise 
in such event  our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 
if that occurs  the market price of our common stock could fall  and you could lose all or part of your investment 

table of contents this annual report on form k includes or incorporates forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of you can identify these forward looking statements by the use of the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  may  will  would  intends  estimates  and other similar expressions  whether in the negative or affirmative 
we cannot guarantee that we actually will achieve the plans  intentions or expectations disclosed in the forward looking statements made 
we have included important factors in the cautionary statements below that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements contained herein 
the forward looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions  mergers or dispositions 
we do not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statements contained herein 
current economic conditions and the global financial crisis may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the global economy is currently experiencing a significant contraction  with an almost unprecedented lack of availability of business and consumer credit 
this current decrease and any future decrease in economic activity in the united states or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
continued and potentially increased volatility  instability and economic weakness and a resulting decrease in discretionary consumer and business spending may result in a reduction in our revenues 
we currently cannot predict the extent to which our revenues may be impacted 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays and discontinuances  a lack of new products  inventory challenges  and less favorable trade credit terms 
a decline in discretionary consumer spending and related externalities could reduce our revenues 
our revenues depend to a degree on discretionary consumer spending  which may decrease due to a variety of factors beyond our control 
these include unfavorable general business  financial and economic conditions  increases in interest rates  increases in inflation  stock market uncertainty  war  terrorism  fears of war or terrorism  increases in consumer debt levels and decreases in the availability of consumer credit  adverse or unseasonable weather conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations  increases in taxation  adverse unemployment trends and other factors that adversely influence consumer confidence and spending 
any one of these factors could result in adverse fluctuations in our revenues generally 
our revenues also depend on the extent to which discretionary consumer spending is directed towards recreational activities generally and equestrian activities and products in particular 
reductions in the amounts of discretionary spending directed to such activities would reduce our revenues 
our customers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  may decline during periods when disposable income is lower  or periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
if this occurs  our revenues would decline  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
material changes in cash flow and debt levels may adversely affect our growth and credit facilities  require the immediate repayment of all our loans  and limit the ability to open new stores 
during seasonal and cyclical changes in our revenue levels  to fund our retail growth strategy  and to fund increases in our direct business  we make use of our credit facilities  which are subject to ebitda  total debt and related covenants 
in the last fiscal quarter  we failed to comply with one of these covenants 
if we are out of compliance with our covenants at the end of a fiscal period  it may adversely affect our growth prospects  require the consent of our lenders to open new stores  or in the worst case  trigger default and require the repayments of all amounts then outstanding on our loans 

table of contents in the event of our insolvency  liquidation  dissolution or reorganization  the lenders under our revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions  if any  were made to our stockholders 
in order to execute our retail store expansion strategy  we may need to borrow additional funds  raise additional equity financing or finance our planned expansion from profits 
we may also need to raise additional capital in the future to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated financial requirements 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing  including the extension or refinancing of our revolving credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
a failure to obtain additional financing or an inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms could require us to incur indebtedness at high rates of interest or with substantial restrictive covenants  including prohibitions on payment of dividends 
we may obtain additional financing by issuing equity securities that will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be forced to scale back operations or be unable to address opportunities for expansion or enhancement of our operations 
our market is highly competitive and we may not continue to compete successfully 
we compete in a highly competitive marketplace with a variety of retailers  dealers and distributors 
the equestrian products market is highly fragmented with approximately  retail store locations nationwide 
many of these are small businesses that have a loyal customer base that compete very effectively in their local markets 
we plan to apply our historic disciplines to confront the significant competition that we face in each of our local markets 
we may  therefore  not be able to generate sufficient sales to support our new retail store locations 
there are also a significant number of sporting goods stores  mass merchandisers and other better funded companies that could decide to enter into or expand their equestrian products offerings 
liquidating inventory sales by our former competitors may cause us temporarily to lose business and perhaps even to lose customers 
in addition  if our continuing competitors reduce their prices  we may have to reduce our prices in order to compete 
we may also be forced to increase our advertising or mail a greater number of catalogs in order to generate the same or even lower level of sales 
any one of these competitive factors could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
it is possible that increased competition or improved performance by our competitors may reduce our market share  may reduce our profit margin  and may adversely affect our business and financial performance in other ways 
if the economic recession continues or we cannot successfully execute our planned retail store expansion  our growth and profitability would be adversely impacted 
as of december   we had twelve retail stores 
in response to the current economic recession  we have placed on hold our plan to rapidly increase the number of retail stores 
a significant percentage of our projected future growth had been expected to be generated from these new locations 
if we experience continued delays in opening new stores  fail to select appropriate sites  encounter problems in opening new locations  or have trouble achieving anticipated sales volume in new locations  our growth and profitability will be adversely impacted 
furthermore  any one or more of the new stores we intend to open may not be profitable  in which event our operating results may suffer 
when the economy begins to rebound  our subsequent ability to expand our retail presence depends in part on the following factors favorable economic conditions  the availability of adequate debt or equity capital  our ability to identify suitable locations in key markets with attractive demographics and which offer attractive returns on our investments  
table of contents the availability of suitable locations at price points consistent with our expansion model  our ability to negotiate favorable lease and construction terms for such locations  our ability to execute sale leaseback transactions on satisfactory terms  if at all  competition for such locations  the timely construction of such retail stores  our ability to receive local and state government permits and approvals in connection with such locations  our ability to attract  train  and retain skilled and knowledgeable store personnel  and our ability to provide a product mix that meets the needs of our customers 
in addition  each retail store is expected to require approximately to million of capital  including start up costs  leasehold improvements and inventory  and excluding the cost of the real estate 
if actual costs are higher than expected or if sales in such stores are lower than expected  we may not be able to open as many retail stores as anticipated or we will need to raise additional capital in order to continue our growth 
we may continue to be unable to open new stores and enter new markets successfully 
an important part of our business plan had been to increase our number of stores and enter new geographic markets 
the economic recession has placed that plan on hold 
since the ipo  we had opened four new stores through december  and remodeled  expanded and converted four stores from the dominion saddlery acquisition 
in the future  when the economy begins to rebound  we plan to open additional stores 
for our growth strategy to be successful  we must identify and lease or buy favorable store sites  hire and train associates and adapt management and operational systems to meet the needs of our expanded operations 
these tasks may be difficult to accomplish successfully  and may also be restricted by covenants and conditions in our loan agreements 
if we are unable to open new stores as quickly as planned  our future sales and profits could be materially adversely affected 
even if we succeed in opening new stores  these new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores 
also  our expansion strategy includes opening new stores in markets where we already have a presence so we can take advantage of economies of scale in marketing  distribution and supervision costs 
however  these new stores may result in the loss of sales in existing stores in nearby areas 
our stock price may fluctuate based on market expectations 
the public trading of our stock is based in large part on market expectations that our business will continue to grow and that we will achieve certain levels of net income 
if the securities analysts that regularly follow our stock lower their ratings or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance  the market price of our stock is likely to drop significantly 
in addition  if our quarterly financial performance does not meet the expectations of securities analysts  our stock price would likely decline 
the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance 
the future sale of shares of our common stock and limited liquidity may negatively impact our stock price 
when our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could fall 
a reduction in ownership by our controlling shareholders or any other large shareholders could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
similarly  the market may disfavor the adoption of rule b trading plans by one or more of the company s officers or 
table of contents directors  perceiving that such a plan represents a decline in management s confidence about the company s prospects or that the parameters for and trading under a rule b sales plan could cause downward pressure on the stock price 
in addition  the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low 
the lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price 
low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion 
the two year decline in the general trading range of the price of our common stock together with the cyclical retail sector with which we are grouped  could reduce interest in our company and thus  continue to deflate demand for purchasing shares of our common stock 
technology failures and privacy and security breaches could adversely affect the company s business 
a significant part of our overall revenues derives from our website sales 
the success of our online business depends in part on factors over which we have limited control 
these factors include changing customer preferences  changing buying trends related to internet usage  changes in technology interfaces  temporary outages due to bandwidth constraints  denial of service attack  computer viruses  and other malicious activity  hardware or network failures  other technology failures or human errors  security breaches and consumer privacy concerns 
any failure to respond successfully to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect sales through our websites  impair our reputation and increase our operating costs 
if our information technology systems fail to perform as designed or if we need to make system changes in order to support our growing direct and retail store businesses  there may be disruptions in operations 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and our point of sale  or pos  systems 
our information technology systems are located in littleton  ma  and our pos systems are located in each retail store 
these systems  which process transactions  respond to customer inquiries  manage inventory  purchase  sell and ship goods on a timely basis  and maintain cost effective operations  are subject to damage from natural disasters  power failures  hardware and software failures  security breaches  network failures  computer viruses and operator negligence 
the failure of our information technology systems and our pos systems to perform as designed  even if temporary  could adversely affect inventory levels  shipments to customers and customer service 
any such event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures  viruses  computer hackers or other causes 
any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information  including data related to customer orders  to be lost or delayed  which could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our customers and might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary investments in technology to compete with our competitors 
accordingly  if changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete  or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our anticipated growth  we could lose customers 
while we believe that our systems are adequate to support our planned opening of additional retail stores over the next several years and the future growth of our direct sales business  we may need to upgrade and modify our information technology capabilities 
any upgrades to our information technology systems and our pos systems may not be successful or may cause substantial expenses 
in addition  there are inherent risks associated with upgrading our core systems  including disruptions that affect our ability to deliver products to our customers 
if we were unable to adequately handle these disruptions  it could adversely affect inventory levels  shipments to customers and customer service 
any such event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

table of contents our growth may strain operations  and finances  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
our business has grown and continues to grow through organic growth and acquisitions 
accordingly  sales  number of stores  number of states in which we conduct business  and number of associates have grown and will likely continue to grow 
this growth places significant demands on management and operational systems  and may be limited by covenants and conditions in our loan agreements 
if we are not successful in continuing to support our operational and financial systems  expanding our management team and increasing and effectively managing our associate base  or managing our finances  this growth is likely to result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of the business and associates  or financial constraints or  in the worst case  default  any one or more of which may in turn adversely affect our business and financial performance 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
we typically realize a higher portion of our revenues and operating results during the fourth quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past  and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future 
our earnings may not continue to grow at rates similar to the growth rates achieved in recent years and may fall short of either a prior fiscal period or investors expectations 
factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following the extent to which sales in new stores result in the loss of sales in existing stores  our direct market  accrual or pre opening store expenses in one or more new store locations  resulting in higher operating expenses without a corresponding increase in revenues  the transaction costs and goodwill associated with acquisitions  the impairment of such goodwill and the adverse effect on our profitability in the event that future performance does not occur as planned  the mix of products sold  pricing actions of competitors  the level of advertising and promotional expenses  and seasonality  primarily because the sales and profitability of our stores are typically slightly lower in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year than in other quarters 
most of our operating expenses  such as rent expense  advertising expense and employee salaries  do not vary directly with the amount of sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if sales in a particular quarter are below expectations for that quarter  we may not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and  therefore  this sales shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our net income for the quarter 
if businesses we acquire do not perform as well as we expect or have liabilities that we are not aware of  we could suffer consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
our business strategy includes growth of our retail sales channel  both through the development and opening of new dover branded store sites and the acquisition and conversion of existing retail stores to the dover brand 
our financial performance may be adversely affected as the result of such acquisitions by such factors as difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations  and employees  inability to successfully integrate the acquired inventory and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies  and procedures  lower than expected loyalty of the customer base of the acquired business to dover branded stores  and products  post acquisition variations in the product mix offered by the stores of the acquired business  resulting in lower revenues  and gross margins  declines in revenues of stores of the acquired business from historical levels and those projected  and the occurrence of any one or more of such factors might lead to the impairment of any goodwill associated with an acquisition  and have an adverse effect on our profitability 
further  businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we have estimated 
although we have obtained 
table of contents indemnification  we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party 
in the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification  we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
our shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership positions 
we have historically granted options to employees as a significant part of our overall compensation package 
as of december   our employees and non employee directors held vested options in the aggregate to acquire  shares of common stock  all of which were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
to the extent that option holders exercise vested outstanding options to purchase common stock  there may be further dilution 
future grants of stock based compensation to employees may also result in dilution 
we may raise additional funds through future sales of our common stock 
any such financing may result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
in addition to causing dilution  stock option grants increase compensation expense and may negatively impact our stock price 
pursuant to current accounting rules  the company has been required to take a current charge  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  for compensation expense associated with our grant of stock options 
for the year ended december   we recognized  of non cash stock based compensation expense 
this charge has the effect of decreasing our net income and earnings per share  which may negatively impact our stock price 
to the extent the company makes future grants of stock based compensation to employees  this charge will increase 
if we cannot continue to successfully generate demand from our direct market channel  it would negatively impact our growth and profitability 
revenues from our direct market channel generated of our revenues in  and we expect such demand to continue to generate a majority of our revenues for at least the next several years 
our success depends on our ability to market  advertise and sell our products effectively through our various catalogs and internet sites 
we believe that the success of our direct market channel depends on favorable economic conditions  our ability to offer a product mix that is attractive to our customers  the price point of our products relative to our competitors  our ability to achieve adequate response rates to our mailings  our ability to add new customers in a cost effective manner  timely delivery of catalog mailings to our customers  an efficient internet interface  a seamless buying experience for our customers across both of our channels  and cost effective and efficient order fulfillment 
catalog production  mailings and paper based packing products  such as shipping cartons  entail substantial paper  postage  human resource and other costs  including costs of catalog development 
we incur most of these costs prior to the mailing of each catalog 
increases in costs of mailing  paper or printing would increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers 
the success of our direct market channel hinges on 
table of contents the achievement of adequate response rates to mailings  merchandising  catalog and website presentations that appeal to our customers  and the expansion of our potential customer base in a cost effective manner 
lack of consumer response to particular catalog or flier mailings or internet marketing efforts may increase our costs and decrease the profitability of our business 
the expected re launch of our retail store rollout could cannibalize existing sales from our direct market channel or existing retail locations 
in response to the current economic recession  we have placed on hold our plan to rapidly increase the number of retail stores 
when the economy begins to rebound  we expect to re launch that plan 
however  our strategy to increase the number of retail store locations is based on finding optimal locations where demand for equestrian products is high 
when we open a retail store in an area that has a high concentration of our existing customers  we expect that such customers will purchase products in the retail location as well as through our catalogs and websites  ultimately increasing their total purchases as multi market channel customers 
demand from our direct market channel in the geographic area surrounding our hockessin  de store declined in the first year of such store s operation 
in the future  in areas where we open retail stores  the customers located within the area of such store may not spend more than they would have from the catalog and websites and therefore there may be a shift in demand from our direct market channel to our retail market channel 
in such case  we may incur significant costs associated with opening a store  shipping product to that store and mailing catalogs while not generating incremental revenue 
when we are able to re launch our retail store expansion plan  our quarterly revenues and earnings could be variable and unpredictable and inventory levels will increase 
over the next several years  when the economy rebounds  we expect to renew our retail store expansion strategy 
as we open new stores  i revenues may fluctuate  and ii pre opening expenses are incurred which may not be offset by a corresponding increase in revenues during the same financial reporting period 
these factors may contribute to variable operating results 
some of the expenses associated with openings of our new retail stores  such as headcount and lease occupancy  will increase 
additionally  as we increase inventory levels to provide stores with merchandise  we may not be able to manage this inventory without incurring additional costs 
if retail store sales are inadequate to support these new costs  our earnings will decrease 
we rely on service providers to operate our business and any disruption of or substantial increases in the costs of their supply of services could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 
we rely on a number of service providers to operate our business such as a printer and a database processor to produce and mail our catalogs  a website hosting service provider to host and manage our websites  telephone companies to provide telephone and fax service to our customer service centers and to communicate between locations  and shipping companies such as fedex  the us postal service  ups  and common carriers for timely delivery of our catalogs  shipment of merchandise to our customers and delivery of merchandise from our suppliers  including foreign suppliers  to us and from our warehouse to our retail stores 
any disruption in these services  or substantial cost increases in these services  may have a negative impact on our ability to market and sell our products and serve our customers and could result in increased costs to us 

table of contents we rely on merchandise suppliers to operate our business and any disruption of their supply of products could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 
we rely on merchandise suppliers to supply our products in saleable condition  in sufficient quantities  at competitive prices and in a timely manner 
we also rely on them to extend favorable sales terms for the purchase of their products 
in  our single largest merchandise supplier accounted for less than of our sales 
our current merchandise suppliers may not be able to accommodate our anticipated product or credit needs in a timely manner or at all 
their business may be adversely affected by the current economic recession  which may curtail part or all of the products we procure from them 
if we are unable to acquire suitable merchandise in a timely manner  obtain favorable credit terms  or lose one or more key merchandise suppliers  we may not be able to offer products that are important to our merchandise assortment  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe our merchandise supplier relationships are satisfactory  we have no contractual arrangements providing for continued supply or credit terms from our key merchandise suppliers and our merchandise suppliers may discontinue selling to us at any time or may raise the cost of merchandise and we may be unable to pass such price increases along to our customers 
if we do not properly manage our inventory levels  our operating results and available funds for future growth will be adversely affected 
we currently maintain a high level of inventory and have a broad depth of products for our customers 
the investment associated with this high level of inventory is substantial 
if we fail to adequately predict the amount or mix of our inventory  we will incur costs associated with stocking inventory that is not being sold or fails to meet the demands of our customers or we may be required to write off or write down inventory which would hurt our operating results 
if we do not meet the needs of our customers  they may decide to purchase products from our competitors 
although we have some ability to return merchandise to our suppliers  we incur additional costs in doing so and we may not be able to return merchandise in the future 
a natural disaster or other disruption at our littleton  ma warehouse fulfillment center could cause us to lose merchandise and be unable to deliver products to our direct sales customers and our retail stores 
we currently rely on our littleton  ma warehouse to handle our fulfillment needs 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption to this center due to fire  flood  tornado  earthquake or any other calamity could damage a significant portion of our inventory  and materially impair our ability to adequately stock our retail stores  deliver merchandise to customers  and process returns to merchandise suppliers and could result in lost revenues and increased costs 
if we lose key members of management or are unable to retain the talent required for our business  our operating results could suffer 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of stephen day  our president and chief executive officer  jonathan grylls  our chief operating officer  and other key personnel including our senior executive management 
we currently maintain two million dollars of key man life insurance on mr 
day  the proceeds of which are required to pay down outstanding debt 
effective as of september   we have entered into employment agreements with mr 
day and mr 
grylls  which contain provisions for non competition  non solicitation and severance 
in addition  our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated  full time and temporary sales personnel with appropriate equestrian products industry knowledge and retail experience to work in management and in our retail stores 
the loss of the services of any one of these individuals or the inability to attract and retain qualified individuals for our 
table of contents key management and retail sales positions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may need additional financing to execute our growth strategy  which may not be available on favorable terms or at all  which could increase our costs  limit our ability to grow and dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
our current revolving credit facility is due in full on january   and its borrowing limit is scheduled for reduction to  in  both of which conditions may limit our ability to finance the opening of all of our planned additional stores over the next several years 
in order to satisfy our revolving credit facility when due and to execute our retail store expansion strategy  we may need to borrow additional funds  raise additional equity financing or finance our planned expansion from profits  but such borrowings or new financings might be limited by the covenants and other terms in other loan agreements 
we may also need to raise additional capital in the future to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated financial requirements 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing  including the extension or refinancing of our revolving credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
a failure to obtain additional financing or an inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms could require us to incur indebtedness at high rates of interest or with substantial restrictive covenants  including prohibitions on payment of dividends 
we may obtain additional financing by issuing equity securities that will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be forced to scale back operations or be unable to address opportunities for expansion or enhancement of our operations 
we rely on foreign sources for many of our products  which subjects us to various risks 
we currently source approximately one quarter of our products from foreign manufacturers located in europe  asia and south america 
as such  we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries 
these risks and uncertainties include currency rate fluctuations  import duties and quotas  work stoppages  economic uncertainties including inflation  foreign government regulations  wars and fears of war  acts of terrorism and fear of acts of terrorism  political unrest and trade restrictions 
additionally  countries in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future may become subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments 
any event affecting prices or causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign merchandise suppliers  including the imposition of additional import restrictions  currency rate fluctuations  restrictions on the transfer of funds or increased tariffs or quotas  or both  could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our operating results 
we do not currently  and we do not plan to  hedge against increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against any foreign currencies 
our product sourcing from foreign merchandise suppliers means  in part  that we may be affected by declines in the value of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies 
specifically  as the value of the us dollar declines relative to other currencies  our effective cost of products increases 
as a result  declines in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would adversely affect our operating results 
when we re launch our retail store expansion strategy  it may result in our direct market channel establishing a nexus with additional states  which may cause our business to pay additional income and sales tax and have an adverse effect on the demand and related cash flows from our direct market channel 
when we re launch our retail store expansion strategy and begin to open retail stores in additional states  the necessary relationship between the retail stores and our direct market channel 
table of contents may be deemed by certain state tax authorities to create a nexus for state income and sales taxation of our business in those states 
this could result in an increase in the tax collection and payment obligations of our business  which would have an adverse effect on the demand and related cash flows from our direct market channel and our overall business 
such sales tax collection obligations  if any  would increase the total cost of our products to our customers 
this increased cost to our customers could negatively affect the revenues of our direct market channel if we are required to reduce the underlying prices for the products marketed through our direct market channel 
the occurrence of either of these events would have an adverse effect on demand and related net cash flows from our direct market channel 
this area of law is uncertain and changing and we could be subject to paying back taxes and penalties 
if we fail to adequately protect our trademarks  our brand and reputation could be impaired or diluted and we could lose customers 
we have  or have rights to  four trademarks that we consider to be material to the successful operation of our business dover saddlery  smith brothers  miller s harness and the source 
we currently use all of these marks in our direct channel business 
we also have several additional pending trademark applications 
we also regard our copyrights  service marks  trade dress  trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
in addition to our registered marks and pending applications  our principal intellectual property rights include copyrights in our catalogs  rights to our domain names and our databases and information management systems 
as such  we rely on trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
nevertheless  the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
our trademark applications may not be granted  and we may not be able to secure significant protection for our marks 
our competitors or others may adopt trademarks or service marks similar to our marks or try to prevent us from using our marks  thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion 
in addition  the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear 
therefore  we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason  our brand and reputation could be impaired or diluted and we may lose customers 
we may have disputes with  or be sued by  third parties for infringement or misappropriation of their proprietary rights  which could have a negative impact on our business 
other parties may assert claims with respect to patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights that are important to our business  such as our dover saddlery  smith brothers and miller s harness trademarks 
other parties might seek to block the use of  or seek monetary damages or other remedies for the prior use of  our intellectual property or the sale of our products as a violation of their trademark  patent or other proprietary rights 
defending any claims  even claims without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly settlements  litigation or restrictions on our business and could damage our reputation 
in addition  there may be prior registrations or use of intellectual property in the us or foreign countries including  but not limited to  similar or competing marks or other proprietary rights of which we are not aware 
in all such countries  it may be possible for any third party owner of a trademark registration in that country or other proprietary right to enjoin or limit our expansion into those countries or to seek damages for our use of such intellectual property in such countries 
in the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property or redesign or rename our products or operations to avoid infringement  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  securing registrations does 
table of contents not fully insulate us against intellectual property claims  as another party may have rights superior to our registration or our registration may be vulnerable to attack on various other grounds 
any such claims of infringement or misappropriation  whether meritorious or not  could be expensive and time consuming to defend  prevent us from operating our business  or portions of our business  cause us to cease selling certain products  result in the loss of customers  require us to re label or re design certain products  if feasible  result in significant monetary liability  divert management s attention and resources  potentially require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary intellectual property  and force us to stop using valuable trademarks under which we market our products

we present adjusted ebitda because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
adjusted ebitda has some limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
some of the limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or capital commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of an impairment charge that might be taken  when future results are not achieved as planned  in respect of goodwill resulting from any premium that the company might pay in the future in connection with potential acquisitions  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  although stock based compensation is a non cash charge  stock options previously awarded  together with additional stock options that might be granted in the future  might have a future dilutive effect on earnings and eps  other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

forward looking statements are not guarantees of our future financial performance  and undue reliance should not be placed on them

factors that could cause such a difference include material changes to dover saddlery  inc s business or prospects  in consumer spending  fashion trends or consumer preferences  or in general political  economic  business or capital market conditions and other risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the other factors that are detailed in item a 
risk factors 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward looking statements 
overview we are the leading specialty retailer and the largest direct marketer of equestrian products in the us for over years  dover saddlery has been a premier upscale marketing brand in the english style riding industry 
we sell our products through a multi channel strategy 
this multi channel strategy has allowed us to use catalogs and our proprietary database of nearly two million names of equestrian enthusiasts as a primary marketing tool to increase catalog sales and to drive additional business to our e commerce websites and retail stores 
in november of  we took dover saddlery public using the open ipo process 
the proceeds of that offering were used to retire debt and launch our retail rollout 
our strategy for growth has been to open additional retail stores using our proprietary mathematical store optimization model to select the sites 
our initial target of retail locations is now complete  with locations up and operating 
was a difficult operating environment for our industry as a result of numerous external factors that led to all time historical lows in consumer confidence which resulted in a contraction in specialty retail consumer spending 
as a result  the company has developed several short term strategies to maintain or expand market share  reduce operating costs and reduce capital expenditures 
in order to manage our way through these uncertain times  our retail expansion has been slowed and we will be extremely opportunistic in negotiating leases for the balance of and management believes retail space lease costs will decline by to over the last quarter of and the first half of on a  square foot location  this is likely to lower the lease cost by approximately per square foot or  annually resulting in enhanced store profitability for new stores opened with the lower lease cost 
aggressive cost control has been employed to counter act the contraction in specialty retail consumer spending  which led to a decrease in dover s total revenues  and a reduction in gross profits of million 
the result has been that we have been able to preserve a non gaap net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the full year performance also generated an estimated federal taxable income of  on a gaap basis  the prior year s net income was  or per diluted share and for a net loss of million or per diluted share the net loss in was due 
table of contents entirely to the non cash  non deductible goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter 
this is a non cash charge which does not  by itself  impact the company s cash flow  future earning power  or ability to service our customers 
below is a table for clarification showing the non gaap net income and earnings per share reconciliation 
we believe that these non gaap measures supplement our gaap financial information and provide useful measures for evaluating operating results and trends 
reconciliation of non gaap to gaap measures year ended december  non gaap impairment gaap pro forma total charges as reported unaudited revenues  net total cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses litigation settlement expense goodwill impairment charge income loss from operations interest expense  financing and other related costs  net other investment loss income loss before income tax provision provision for income taxes net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted number of shares used in per share calculation basic diluted estimated federal taxable income unaudited income loss before taxes gaap permanent differences state taxes tax timing differences estimated federal taxable income the company believes that the following strategic actions  which will be taken in  will allow it to successfully weather the present negative macroeconomic conditions and return to positive 
table of contents growth in sales and earnings as consumer confidence is restored and the economy turns around 
these are aggressive cost control particularly in the area of targeted marketing  direct labor in the warehouse call center and retail stores  and management salaries 
reduction in capital expenditures by scaling back store expansion and being extremely opportunistic in present and future lease negotiations 
careful monitoring of same store sales growth and direct marketing response rates in order to determine when the company s customers have returned to normal spending behavior  which will allow dover to increase its marketing activities 
in this time of economic uncertainty  it is very difficult to accurately predict economic trends  however  as changing market conditions become clear  we will adapt our strategies to address these new conditions 
consolidated performance and trends the company reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million or per diluted share  which included a non cash  non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million triggered by declines in the company s market capitalization 
this is compared to a net income of  or per diluted share for the corresponding period in the results reflect our continuing efforts to execute our growth strategy in the retail market channel  where revenues increased to million for the year ended this trend of increased revenue may be slowed or eroded by delays in the execution of our new store expansion strategy  constraints in available capital  and interim declines in consumer demand at our retail stores implicated by the current global financial and credit crisis 
we respond to fluctuations in revenues primarily by delaying the opening of new stores  adjusting marketing efforts and operations to support our retail stores and manage costs  as well as continuing to focus on our proprietary store optimization modeling to determine the rate and location of new store openings 
our direct market channel revenues decreased  to million for the year ended december   due to a combination of factors  including lower unit volumes attributable to the significant consumer spending slowdown in the overall economy 
we respond to fluctuations in our direct customers response by adjusting the quantities of catalogs mailed and other marketing and customer related strategies and tactics in order to maximize revenues and manage costs 
the reversal of these trends of decreased direct revenue  delays in our new store growth plan  and reduced borrowing capacity in our credit facility is dependent upon the response of our customers to these market conditions 
gaap requires that the carrying value of goodwill on the company s balance sheet be reviewed for impairment at least annually  and that a non cash charge against earnings be taken if it is determined that an impairment in the value of goodwill has occurred 
given the declines in market capitalizations generally in the current global financial and economic recession  impairment charges are no longer uncommon 
the company performed its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of december   in connection with the preparation of its annual financial statements that are presented in this annual report 
based on the results of the goodwill impairment test  the company determined impairment had occurred  which resulted in the write off of the entire balance of goodwill at december  as required by gaap 
this was a non cash  non tax deductible charge of approximately  which we do not believe impacts the company s cash flow  future earning power or ability to serve its customers 
in this time of economic uncertainty  we are unable to predict economic trends  but we continue to monitor the situation as it relates to our operations  including new store openings and capital spending 
single reporting segment the company operates and manages its business as one operating segment utilizing a multi channel distribution strategy 

table of contents revenues we market and sell the most comprehensive selection of products in the equestrian industry 
we currently derive our revenues from product sales from two integrated market channels direct and retail 
our direct market channel generates product sales from both catalog mailings and internet marketing  and our retail store sales consist of product sales generated by our retail market channel 
we sell to the english style riding market through our dover saddlery brand and to the western style riding market through our smith brothers brand 
in  approximately of our revenues generated by our direct market channel  and generated by our twelve retail stores  which increased from the of retail sales in  due primarily to the success of our retail rollout plan 
all revenues are recorded net of product returns 
the company defines our same store sales to include sales from all stores open for a full fifteen months following a grand opening  or conversion to a dover branded store 
revenues from our product sales are seasonal 
in addition  our revenues can be affected by the timing of our catalog mailings 
in  of our revenues were generated in the fourth quarter 
cost of revenues the most significant components of our cost of revenues are product costs  purchasing  handling and transportation costs to obtain the products and ship them to our customers 
we manage our integrated merchandising efforts by forming positive relationships with over suppliers to ensure competitive costs and the most up to date and complete product offering for our customers 
we have implemented procedures to promote labor efficiencies in the handling of our products 
in addition  we work closely with transportation companies in negotiating competitive rate structures to manage our freight costs 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenues varies according to the season of the year and the mix of products sold 
our gross profit may not be comparable to other specialty retailers  as some companies include all of the costs related to distribution in cost of revenues while others  like us  exclude all or a portion of the costs related to distribution from cost of revenues and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of advertising  marketing and other brand building costs  primarily associated with developing  printing and distributing our catalogs and internet advertising  labor and related costs for order processing  and salaries and related costs for marketing  creative and executive personnel  labor and occupancy costs to operate our retail stores  infrastructure costs and information system costs  credit card processing fees  occupancy and other overhead costs  store pre opening costs  public company  professional fees and other legal  accounting and related costs  and non cash  stock based compensation

these non gaap measures are referred to as non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share  both of which reflect adjustments for the goodwill impairment charge

goodwill impairment charge we test our goodwill annually for impairment  in connection with the preparation of our financial statements 
at december   we performed the initial step of our impairment evaluation by comparing the fair market value of our single reporting unit  as determined using market capitalization  to its carrying value 
since the carrying value exceeded the fair value  the second step of the impairment evaluation was performed to calculate the value of the impairment in accordance with gaap 
the result was a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  the entire amount of the goodwill carrying value 
this charge was recorded with no corresponding tax benefit 
the primary reason for the goodwill impairment charge was the reduction in our market capitalization 
this is a non cash charge which does not by itself impact the company s cash flow  future earning power or ability to serve its customers 
at december   our goodwill impairment test showed that the fair value of our single reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
interest expense interest expense  including amortization of deferred financing costs attributed to our subordinated debt and revolving credit facility  decreased for the year ended december  to million  compared to million for the corresponding period in this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced rates in our revolving credit facility 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  and million for the corresponding period in the effective tax rates for the year to date periods were recorded based upon management s best estimates of the rates for the entire respective years  and are adjusted each quarter 
the rate is attributable to increased state tax rates and liabilities and the inability to deduct  for tax purposes  the goodwill impairment charge 
net income loss on a gaap basis  the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share 
this net loss was due entirely to the non cash  non deductible goodwill impairment

marketing costs  primarily catalog and new store support  increased million and professional fees increased million due to litigation costs 
litigation settlement expense the litigation settlement expense of million for the year ended december   is a charge for the final settlement of the gah litigation  which we incurred in the first quarter of to avoid additional costs of preparation and trial  the burden on management  and the risk of a large adverse award 
interest expense interest expense  including amortization of deferred financing costs attributed to our subordinated debt and revolving credit facility  increased to million in  compared to million in our debt levels increased due primarily to new store development and inventories  as well as increased warehouse inventories  in order to fulfill growing demand across a greater number of retail stores

the beginning of the spring outdoor riding season in the northern half of the country has typically generated a slightly stronger second quarter of the year  and the holiday buying season has generated additional demand for our normal equestrian product lines in the fourth quarter of the year 
revenues for the first and third quarters of the calendar year have tended to be somewhat lower than the second and fourth quarters 
we anticipate that our revenues will continue to vary somewhat by season 
the timing of our new retail store openings has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant impact on our quarterly results 
we will incur one time expenses related to the opening of each new store 
as we open new stores  i revenues may spike and then settle  and ii pre opening expenses  including occupancy and management overhead  are incurred  which may not be offset by correlating revenues during the same financial reporting period 
as a result of these factors  new retail store openings may result in temporary declines in operating profit  both in dollars and as a percentage of sales

working capital and capital expenditure needs we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  expected cash to be provided by our operating activities  and funds available through our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the expansion of our retail stores  the acquisition of new capabilities or technologies and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalents  cash from operations and cash from our revolving credit facility under the conditions and covenants of our credit facilities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  businesses  services or technologies which we anticipate would require us to seek additional equity or debt financing  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when payment is reasonably assured  the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
for direct merchandise sales  this occurs when product is delivered to the common carrier at the company s warehouse 
for retail sales  this occurs 
table of contents at the point of sale 
for the periods presented  merchandise returns have been consistent  resulting in period end reserves of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we do not anticipate changes to the future trends of our merchandise returns 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized at the time the products are shipped to the customer and are included in net revenues 
shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 
inventory valuation inventory consists of finished goods in the company s mail order warehouse and retail stores 
the company s inventory is stated at the lower of cost  with cost determined by the first in  first out fifo method  or net realizable value 
the company maintains a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this reserve was  for the years ended december  and the company continuously monitors the salability of its inventories to ensure adequate valuation of the related merchandise 
inventory valuation charges have remained consistent throughout each period presented 
we do not foresee any change to this trend which currently recognizes annual valuation charges below that of the period end reserve balances 
advertising costs and catalog expenses the costs of direct response advertising materials  primarily catalog production and distribution costs  are deferred in accordance with statement of position sop  reporting on advertising costs 
these costs are recognized over the period of expected future revenue  which is less than one year 
advertising costs not related to our direct response catalogs and marketing activities are expensed as incurred 
income taxes the company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carry forwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
the company was subject to the provisions of fin as of january   and has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
the adoption of fin had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation the company adopted sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 as of january   using the modified prospective method 
therefore  the results for the year ended december  have not been restated 
since adoption  all share based payments to employees  and directors  including grants of employee stock options  are recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we do not believe that any of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  were impaired as of december  and we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment 
management has determined  based on the guidance of sfas no 
 there is a single reporting unit  the company as a whole 
we performed our annual test of impairment of goodwill as of december   in connection with the preparation of our financial statements presented in this annual report 
we determined that impairment of the entire recorded amount of goodwill had occurred  as the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately  in the statement of operations  the entire amount of the goodwill carrying value  with no tax benefit 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk nearly all of our revenues are derived from transactions denominated in us dollars 
we purchase products in the normal course of business from foreign manufacturers 
as such  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with those product purchases  but this exposure has not been significant 
impact of inflation we believe the effects of inflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition have not been material in recent years 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  including money market funds and certificates of deposit 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
as of december   all of our investments were held in money market funds and certificates of deposits 
our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments  primarily certain borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the advances under this revolving credit facility bear a variable rate of interest determined as a function of the prime rate and the published libor rate at the time of the borrowing 
if interest rates were to increase by two percent  the additional interest expense as of december  would be approximately  annually 
at december   million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility
