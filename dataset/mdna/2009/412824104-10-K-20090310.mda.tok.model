many of the foregoing factors are partially  or entirely  outside of the control of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require harleysville group to make estimates and assumptions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
harleysville group believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation 
the judgments  or the methodology on which the judgments are made  are reviewed quarterly with the audit committee 
liabilities for losses and loss settlement expenses 
the liability for losses and loss settlement expenses represents estimates of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses incurred  including losses for claims which have not yet been reported to harleysville group 
the amount of loss reserves for reported claims is based primarily upon a case by case evaluation of the type of risk involved  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each claim and the insurance policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
the amounts of loss reserves for unreported claims and loss settlement expense reserves are determined utilizing historical information by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions 
inflation is implicitly provided for in the reserving function through analysis of costs  trends and reviews of historical reserving results 
estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and updated on a regular basis using the most r ecent information on reported claims and a variety of actuarial techniques 
it is expected that such estimates will be more or less than the amounts ultimately paid when the claims are settled 
changes in these estimates are reflected in current operations 
investments 
generally  unrealized investment gains or losses on investments carried at fair value  net of applicable income taxes  are reflected directly in shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
however  if the fair value of an investment declines below its cost and that decline is deemed other than temporary  the amount of the decline below cost is charged to earnings 
harleysville group monitors its investment portfolio and at least quarterly reviews investments that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
such evaluations consider  among other things  the magnitude and reasons for a decline and the prospects for the fair value to recover in the near term  and harleysville group s ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time su fficient to allow for a recovery in value 
future adverse investment market conditions  or poor operating results of underlying investments  could result in an impairment charge in the future 
the severe downturn in the public debt and equity markets  reflecting uncertainties associated with the mortgage crisis  worsening economic conditions  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in large financial institutions  has resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio 
depending on market conditions going forward  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods 
harleysville group has written down to fair value  any equity security that has declined below cost by i more than and maintained such decline for six months  or ii by or more in the quarter in which either such decline occurred 
in some cases  securities that have declined by a lesser amount or for a shorter period of time are written down if the evaluation indicates the decline is other than temporary 
fair value of equity securities is based on the closing market value 
the fair value of mutual fund holdings is based on the closing net asset value reported by the fund 
the fair value of fixed maturities is based upon industry standard pricing methodologies based on observable market data 
it can be difficult to determine the fair value of non traded securities  but harleysville group does not own a material amount of non traded securities 
policy acquisition costs 
policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  premium taxes and certain other underwriting and agency expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of business  are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies and in proportion to the premiums earned 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
the estimation of net realizable value takes into account the premium to be earned  related investment income over the claim paying period  expected losses and loss settlement expenses  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
future changes in estimates  the most significant of which is expected losses and loss settlement expenses  may require adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs 
if the estimation of net realizable value indicates that the deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable  they would be written off and further analyses would be performed to determine if an additional liability would need to be accrued 
contingencies 
besides claims related to its insurance products  harleysville group is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business 
harleysville group assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
there can be no assurance that actual outcomes will be consistent with those assessments 
the application of certain of these critical accounting policies to the years ended december  and is discussed in greater detail below 
results of operations harleysville group underwrites property and casualty insurance in both the personal and commercial lines of insurance 
the personal lines of insurance include both auto and homeowners  and the commercial lines include auto  commercial multi peril and workers compensation 
the business is marketed primarily in the eastern and midwestern united states through independent agents 
historically  harleysville group s results of operations have been influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general 
the operating results of the united states property and casualty insurance industry have been subject to significant variations due to competition  weather  catastrophic events  regulation  the availability and cost of satisfactory reinsurance  general economic conditions  judicial trends  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment 
harleysville group s premium growth and underwriting results have been  and continue to be  influenced by market conditions 
insurance industry price competition has often made it difficult both to obtain and to retain properly priced personal and commercial lines business 
it is management s policy to continue to maintain its underwriting standards 
the key elements of harleysville group s business model are the sales of properly priced and underwritten personal and commercial property and casualty insurance through independent agents and the investment of the premiums in a manner designed to assure that claims and expenses can be paid while providing a return on the capital employed 
loss trends and investment performance are critical factors in influencing the success of the business model 
these factors are affected by the factors impacting the insurance industry in general as described above and factors unique to harleysville group as described in the following discussion 
transactions with affiliates the company s property and casualty subsidiaries participate in a pooling agreement with harleysville mutual insurance company the mutual company and its property and casualty insurance subsidiary  harleysville pennland insurance company pennland 
the pooling agreement provides for the allocation of premiums  losses  loss settlement expenses and underwriting expenses between harleysville group and the mutual company 
harleysville group is not liable for any losses incurred by the mutual company or company subsidiaries harleysville preferred insurance company preferred and harleysville insurance company of new jersey hnj prior to january   the date the pooling agreement became effective 
harleysville group s participation in the pool was from january  through december effective january   the company s property and casualty subsidiaries and the mutual company and pennland amended their intercompany pooling agreement to increase harleysville group s share of the pool from to 
harleysville group received cash and investments of million on january  associated with the transfer of liabilities from the mutual company to harleysville group in connection with the pool change 
the company s liabilities increased million and the company reimbursed the mutual company million  through a ceding commission  for expenses that were incurred to generate the additional business assumed by the company s property and casualty subsidiaries  which ceding commission was deferred as policy acquisition costs 
these liabilities consist of the following at january  in thousands unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses net of reinsurance unearned premiums net of reinsurance other liabilities less ceding commission paid when the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries pooling participation increases  there is a larger retrocession of this pooled business from the mutual company 
through this retrocession  harleysville group is assuming a larger share of premiums  losses and underwriting expenses for current and future periods originating both from its subsidiaries and the mutual company 
an increase in harleysville group s pooling participation results in a larger share of the pooled liabilities being assumed by harleysville group 
cash and investments are received by harleysville group equal to this greater share of loss reserves  unearned premiums and other insurance liabilities primarily commissions and premium taxes less a ceding commission based on acquisition costs related to unearned premiums 
an increase in pool participation also increases harleysville group s leverage and exposure to prior period development 
because the pooling agreement does not relieve harleysville group of primary liability as the originating insurer  there is a concentration of credit risk arising from business ceded to the mutual company 
however  the pooling agreement provides for the right of offset and the amount of credit risk with the mutual company was not material at december  and the mutual company has an a

harleysville ltd 
is a subsidiary of the company and leases the home office to the mutual company  which shares the facility with harleysville group 
rental income under the lease was million for  and million for and  respectively  and is included in other income after elimination of intercompany amounts of million in and million in and  respectively 
the lease has a five year term expiring december  and includes a formula for additional rent for any additions  improvements or renovations 
the mutual company is responsible for the building operating expenses including maintenance and repairs 
the pricing of the lease was based upon an appraisal obtained from an independent real estate appraiser 
harleysville group provides certain management services to the mutual company and other affiliates 
harleysville group received a fee of million  million and million in  and  respectively  for its services under these management agreements 
under related agreements  harleysville group serves as the paymaster for harleysville companies  with each company being charged for its proportionate share of salary and employee benefits expense based upon time allocation 
the level of fees has been approved by each state insurance department having jurisdiction 
the company s insurance subsidiaries and the mutual company are party to an equipment and supplies allocation agreement whereby equipment and supplies are shared between parties 
ultimate expense for such items is allocated to harleysville group based on its pooling participation 
the mutual company has purchased and developed certain equipment and software which is expensed by harleysville group based on its pooling participation as the items are depreciated or amortized 
intercompany balances are created primarily from the pooling arrangement settled quarterly  allocation of common expenses  collection of premium balances and payment of claims settled monthly 
no interest is charged or received on intercompany balances due to the timely settlement terms and nature of the items 
harleysville group borrowed million from the mutual company in connection with the acquisition of subsidiaries mid america insurance company mid america and harleysville insurance company of new york hic new york in it was a demand loan with a stated maturity in march which had been extended to march in february  the maturity was extended again to march and the interest rate became libor plus  which was a commercially reasonable market rate in interest expense on this loan was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
harleysville group has no material relationships with current or former members of management other than compensatory plans and arrangements disclosed or described in the company s public filings 
off balance sheet arrangements harleysville group has off balance sheet credit risk related to approximately million and million of premium balances due to the mutual company from agents and insureds at december  and  respectively 
the mutual company bills and collects such receivables on behalf of harleysville group for efficiency reasons 
harleysville group recognizes any associated bad debts  which have not been material 
compared to premiums earned increased million  or  for the year ended december  due to the increase in the pool participation percentage effective january  of the million increase  million  or  was in commercial lines and million  or  was in personal lines 
excluding the impact of the change in the pool participation percentage  premiums earned decreased million  or  for the year ended december  this decrease of million in premiums earned is due to a decrease of million  or  in premiums earned for commercial lines and an increase of million  or  in premiums earned for personal lines 
the decrease in premiums earned for commercial lines was primarily due to a decrease in the commercial auto line of business due to lower average premiums and a decrease in earned premiums assumed from involuntary pools 
the increase in premiums earned for personal lines was primarily due to an increase in homeowners business due to higher average premiums  partially offset by a decrease in the personal auto line of business due to lower average premiums 
investment income increased million for the year ended december   primarily due to a higher level of invested assets  partially offset by a lower investment yield on fixed income securities and a greater percentage of fixed income securities invested in tax exempt securities 
the higher level of invested assets was primarily due to the investments received january  in connection with the pool change  partially offset by a decrease in investments due to the increase in shares repurchased under the company s stock repurchase program 
net realized investment gains losses decreased million for the year ended december   primarily due to losses on the sale of equity securities  resulting from the decrease in the financial markets  and an increase in impairment charges in in the third quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of million on equity securities that it was planning to sell 
there was an additional impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of on the equity securities  prior to their sale 
the equity securities were sold in november to recover a portion of federal income taxes which were previously paid 
in  the company sold all of its holdings of individual equity securities and invested in equity index funds 
as a result of this transaction  the company recognized a capital gain of approximately million 
under existing federal income tax regulations  such taxes can be recovered in future periods to the extent capital losses are recognized 
as a result of the decline in value of the equity index funds held by the company during  the duration of the impairment  the likelihood of near term recovery and the availability to car ryback realized capital losses for federal income tax purposes upon their disposal  the company determined that it was appropriate to sell the equity investments and recover a portion of the federal income taxes which were previously paid 
there were impairment charges of million in non equity securities in and million in the impairment charges consisted of million on lehman brothers bonds and million on structured investment vehicles 
the impairment charges consisted of million on bonds and million on a structured investment vehicle 
harleysville group holds securities with unrealized losses at december  as follows fair value unrealized loss length of unrealized loss less than months over months in thousands fixed maturities obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate securities mortgage backed securities total fixed maturities of the total fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss at december   securities with a fair value of million and an unrealized loss of million are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value on the balance sheet  while securities with a fair value of million and an unrealized loss of million are classified as held to maturity on the balance sheet and are carried at amortized cost 
the fixed maturity investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than twelve months were primarily due to a widening of credit spreads rather than a decline in credit quality 
there are million in fixed maturity securities  at fair value  that at december   had been below amortized cost for over twelve months 
of the million of unrealized losses on such securities  million was related to securities which carry an investment grade debt rating where the unrealized loss was primarily due to a widening of credit spreads 
the remaining unrealized loss of million was related to securities which carry a debt rating below investment grade 
per the company s policy  a fixed maturity security is other than temporarily impaired if it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due under the security s contractual terms or where the company does not hav e the ability and intent to hold the security to recovery 
the company believes  based on its analysis  that these securities are not other than temporarily impaired and harleysville group has the ability and intent to hold these securities at least until recovery 
however  depending on developments involving both the issuers and worsening economic conditions  these investments may be written down in the income statement in the future 
income before income taxes decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to the change in realized investment gains losses and underwriting losses in compared to underwriting gains in  partially offset by the increase in investment income 
the underwriting loss in was primarily due to greater catastrophe losses and greater non catastrophe property losses 
an insurance company s statutory combined ratio is a standard measure of underwriting profitability 
this ratio is the sum of the ratio of incurred losses and loss settlement expenses to net earned premium  the ratio of expenses incurred for commissions  premium taxes  administrative and other underwriting expenses to net written premium  and the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net earned premium 
the combined ratio does not reflect investment income  federal income taxes or other non operating income or expense 
a ratio of less than percent generally indicates underwriting profitability 
harleysville group s statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the statutory combined ratio for includes a benefit of due to the impact of the transfer of liabilities in connection with the pool chan ge 
this benefit results from the statutory treatment of the ceding commission paid on the unearned premiums transferred on january  excluding the impact of the pool transfer  the statutory combined ratio increased to for the increase in the combined ratio was due to higher catastrophe losses in and greater non catastrophe property losses 
net catastrophe losses increased to million points for from million l points for the catastrophe losses were primarily due to tornadoes and hail storms impacting arkansas and minnesota during the second quarter 
the statutory combined ratios by line of business for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  are shown below 
the statutory combined ratios for are shown both including and excluding the impact of the pool transfer 
the combined ratios excluding the pool transfer are shown  as they are prepared on a basis that is comparable to the combined ratios for for the year ended december  including the impact of the pool transfer excluding the impact of the pool transfer commercial automobile workers compensation commercial multi peril other commercial total commercial personal automobile homeowners other personal total personal total personal and commercial the commercial lines statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  excluding the impact of the pool transfer  the commercial lines statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the commercial lines combined ratio for the year ended december  primarily relates to the higher incidence of catastrophe losses during this year points compared to the catastrophe losses in the prior year points and non catastrophe property loss activity 
the higher than average catastrophe experience primarily relates to losses associated with tornado activity in arkansas during the second quarter and  to a lesser extent  losses from hurricane ike during the third quarter 
the personal lines statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  excluding the impact of the pool transfer  the personal lines statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the personal lines combined ratio for the year ended december  primarily relates to the higher incidence of catastrophe losses during this year points compared to the catastrophe losses in the prior year points and non catastrophe property loss activity 
the higher than average catastrophe experience primarily relates to losses associated with a series of hail events in minnesota during the second quarter 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses are estimated for case reserves and losses incurred but not reported ibnr separately 
the sum of case reserves and ibnr represents the company s estimate of total unpaid loss and loss settlement expense 
case reserves are determined for each reported claim by the company s claims organization reflecting the known circumstances of the individual claim 
the company s actuaries calculate ibnr by reducing their estimate of ultimate loss and loss settlement expense by cumulative paid loss and loss settlement expense and case reserves 
ultimate losses are re estimated for each line of business on a quarterly basis using the most current loss and claim data as of the quarter end 
in addition to analyzing reserves on a line of business basis  reserving categories are identified and reviewed 
for example  the following categories for the commercial auto liability line of business are analyzed quarterly commercial auto liability bodily injury  commercial auto liability property damage  and commercial auto liability excess 
in the discussion that follows  these categories are referred to by the label line of business 
in the course of our quarterly reserve estimation process  several standard loss reserving methods and procedures are utilized to derive estimates of ultimate loss for each line of business  including paid loss development method incurred loss development method incurred counts and averages method based on exponential fit of severity bornhuetter ferguson method any individual method used to estimate loss reserves has its advantages and disadvantages based on trends  changes within the external business environment  changes in internal company processes and procedures and any bias that may be inherent in the methodology 
the actuaries give consideration to the relative strengths and weaknesses of each of the methods to derive a selected point estimate within the range 
following is a general description of each of the methods used paid loss development method the paid loss development method uses historical payment patterns to project future payments as of a given evaluation date to ultimate loss 
estimates using this method are not affected by changes in case reserving practices that might have occurred during the review period  but may be understated as this method does not take into account large unpaid claims 
this method is also susceptible to any changes in the rate of claim settlements or shifts in the size of claims settled 
a number of indications of ultimate loss may be produced from the paid loss development method since a number of loss development factors ldfs may be selected 
the actuaries produce and review several indications of ultimate loss using this method based on various ldf selections as judged appropriate  such as year average straight average and loss weighted average year average straight average and loss weighted average year excluding highest and lowest ldfs all year loss weighted average selected ldf pattern ldfs are selected for each evaluation based on the actuaries review of the historical development incurred loss development method the incurred loss development method is similar to the paid method  but instead uses historical incurred case reserves plus payments patterns to project future incurred losses as of a given evaluation date to ultimate loss 
in many cases  the incurred development method is preferred over the paid method as it includes the additional information provided by the aggregation of individual case reserves 
the resulting ldfs tend to be lower and more stable than those of the paid development method 
however  the incurred development method may be affected by changes in case reserving practices and any unusually large individual claims 
as with the paid loss development method  various indications of ultimate loss may be produced from the incurred loss development method 
the actuaries produce and review several indications of ultimate loss using this method based on various ldf selections 
incurred counts and averages method this method is used to estimate ultimate loss by separately estimating ultimate counts and severity average loss per claim components of ultimate loss 
both the ultimate claim counts and ultimate severity are estimated using a loss development factor approach similar to the incurred loss development method 
for this reason  the same considerations discussed in the incurred loss development method apply to this method as well 
an ultimate severity is selected by fitting an exponential curve to the historical ultimate severities indicated using the ratio of the ultimate loss and ultimate claim counts 
this method yields ultimate severities that are based on the underlying historical trends in the data 
ultimate claim counts and ultimate severities are multiplied together to produce an estimate of ultimate losses 
this method is useful in more recent accident years where the data is not mature and is especially useful when loss development patterns are volatile or not well established 
bornhuetter ferguson method the bornhuetter ferguson method is a blended method that explicitly takes into account both actual loss development to date and expected future loss emergence 
two versions of this method exist one based on paid loss and one based on incurred loss 
this method uses the selected loss development patterns from the development methods to calculate the expected percentage of loss unpaid or unreported 
the expected component of the method is calculated by multiplying earned premium for the given exposure period by a selected a priori loss ratio 
the resulting dollars are then multiplied by the expected percentage of unpaid or unreported loss described above 
this provides an estimate of future loss payments or reporting that is then added to actual paid or incurred loss data to produce estimated ultimate loss 
each of the methodologies described above and their derivatives are reviewed for each line of business 
this approach allows the actuaries to identify and respond to the unique characteristics of each line of business 
further  since long term historical data is reviewed  changes in development patterns within a line of business may likewise be identified and considered in the actuaries process of selecting ultimate loss 
an actuarial best estimate of ultimate loss is selected for each line of business based on a review of the indications produced by the above methodologies 
more consideration is given to those methods that the actuaries deem to be more appropriate in a particular situation 
in addition  other metrics such as claim closing ratios  average case reserve levels  paid loss to incurred loss ratios  individual large loss information  and recent insurance pricing changes are reviewed to help the actuaries select the most appropriate estimates of ultimate loss 
the selection of the ultimate loss is based on information unique to each line of business and accident year and the judgment and expertise of the actuaries 
short tail versus long tail lines of business the reserving methods described above are generally applied to each line of business  regardless of their classification as short tail or long tail 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the final settlement of the claim 
the merits of an individual reserving method relative to the line of business and age of accident period are considered in the actuaries process of selecting ultimate loss 
short tail lines of business  by definition  develop to their ultimate value faster than long tail lines of business 
property coverages including inland marine along with automobile physical damage coverages are considered short tail lines of business 
automobile liability  general liability  commercial multi peril liability and workers compensation are considered long tail lines of business 
for many liability claims  significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss  and the final settlement of the claim 
workers compensation claims can result in providing medical benefits and wage replacement over the course of an injured worker s lifetime 
in general  more consideration may be given to the results of the development methodologies for short tail lines than to long tail lines for accident periods of the same maturity 
for example  the indicated ultimate loss using the incurred loss development method for the most recent accident year is generally considered more reliable for a short tail line  such as homeowners property  than a long tail line  such as workers compensation 
as mentioned previously  the selection of ultimate loss is based on information unique to each line of business and accident year subject to exceptions  such as the emergence of one or more unusually large claims in a particular accident period for a short tail line 
in this case  the indications produced by the development methods may be overstated due to development of ultimate losses in excess of policy limits and such information would be considered in the actuaries process of selecting ultimate loss 
immature accident periods the paid loss development method is generally given less consideration than the incurred loss development method for less mature accident periods since the relatively low magnitude of losses paid at early evaluations tends to result in less reliable indications from the paid loss development method 
for long tail lines of business  neither the incurred nor the paid loss development methods may receive much consideration for the most recent accident period 
this is due to the fact that the relatively low magnitude of losses either incurred or paid at early evaluations tends to result in less reliable indications from these methods 
in faster developing  short tailed lines such as auto physical damage  special property  homeowners  commercial multi peril property and property damage  the paid loss development method  the incurred loss development method and the bornhuetter ferguson methods are primarily used as they typically produce tightly clustered projections for all accident years 
the estimation of loss reserves for long tail lines such as commercial auto liability  commercial multi peril liability  and workers compensation is more complex and is subject to a higher degree of variability than for short tail lines of business

in total  million of favorable development was recognized in the homeowners line during an increase in other personal lines severity was observed during  primarily related to the emergence of a single million claim in the third quarter 
in total  million of adverse development was recognized in other personal lines during the tables below break out the change in the estimate of ultimate losses between december  and december  for the   and accident years into severity and frequency components for the major commercial and personal lines of business 
table summarizes the company s percentage change in the estimate of ultimate loss and loss settlement expense by line of business between december  and december  tables and summarize the company s percentage change in the estimate of ultimate severity and ultimate claim counts  respectively 
the relationship between the three tables is as follows the change in estimated ultimate loss the change in estimated ultimate severity x the change in estimated ultimate claim counts 
the estimated ultimate severity is calculated as the ratio of estimated ultimate loss to estimated ultimate claim counts 
the amounts underly ing these tables are based on direct loss and claim experience minus ceded loss experience and exclude a small portion of losses associated with business assumed from involuntary pools

in this context  the term severity does not refer to an actuarial assumption  rather  it refers to severity as a descriptive statistic derived from the ratio of estimated ultimate loss to estimated ultimate claim counts 
broadly speaking  as estimates of the ultimate number of claims were relatively stable for the prior accident periods  the changes in estimates of ultimate loss are characterized as resulting from a reduction in severity 
broadly speaking  those lines of business with a relatively low underlying volume of data  such as other commercial lines and other personal lines  are subject to greater variability in both claim severity and claim count development 
for example  the increase in severity of in other personal lines in accident year relates to the emergency of a single million claim during the twelve months ended december  the following table presents workers compensation claim count information for the total pooled business in which harleysville group participates and payment amounts which are harleysville group s pooling share of the total pooled amounts for the year ended december  for the year ended december  dollars in thousands number of claims pending  beginning of period number of claims reported number of claims settled or dismissed number of claims pending  end of period losses paid loss settlement expenses paid workers compensation losses primarily consist of indemnity and medical costs for injured workers 
harleysville group records the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses incurred 
the estimate represents the actuarially determined expected amount of future payments on all loss and loss settlement expenses incurred on or before december  actuarial loss reserving techniques and assumptions  which rely on historical information as adjusted to reflect current conditions  have been consistently applied  after including consideration of recent case reserve activity  during the periods presented 
changes in the estimate of the liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses reflect actual payments and evaluations of new information and data since the last reporting date 
these changes correlate with actuarial trends 
the following table presents the liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses by case and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves by line of business and a statistically determined range of estimates of the ultimate unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses incurred for each line of business as of december  the range of estimates around the actuarial best estimates is statistically determined in order to provide information regarding the variability of the actuarial best estimates 
the statistical analysis is completed only on a basis that is net of reinsurance recoverables  as this appropriately reflects harleysville group s risk profile based on the type and quality of its reinsurance 
the range is determined using the monte carlo simulation method 
this method uses the company s actual historical loss data to estimate the mean and standard deviation of a statistical distribution for future loss development 
there have been no adjustments made to the historical data 
the company s application of the monte carlo simulation assumes that loss development factors are normally distributed with a mean and standard deviation derived from the historical data 
reserve ranges are determined using both paid and incurred loss development data with a  trial simulation run against each set of data for each line of business presented in the table below 
each simulation generates a unique set of loss development factors randomly generated from the normal distribution with mean and standard deviation as defined above 
each unique set of loss development factors  when applied to the data  produces a unique reserve estimate 
at the completion of the simulation  there are  unique reserve estimates which can be ordered from lowest to highest creating a range of reserve estimates 
the resulting range produced by the simulation is used to create a reasonable representation of a confidence interval using the point as the low end of the range and the point as the high end of the range 
the confidence interval represents the range of reserve estimates for which there is approximately a probabi lity that the actual reserve amount which will not be known for many years is contained within the defined range 
the total commercial lines range and total personal lines range were developed as separate simulations using the means and standard deviations of the individual lines as inputs 
therefore  the confidence interval for all lines of business is smaller than the straight sum of the individual lines of business intervals 
the use of this technique to analyze reserve ranges assumes historical data has validity in predicting future outcomes 
this assumption is consistent with a key assumption underlying much of insurance pricing and reserving theory

of these amounts  million and million  respectively or and  respectively  of the receivables were due from governmental bodies  regulatory agencies or quasi governmental pools and reinsurance facilities where  harleysville group believes  there is limited credit risk 
the remainder of the reinsurance recoverables are principally due from reinsurers rated a or higher by the am best company 
ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve harleysville group s primary obligation to its policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverables to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligation or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contract 
from time to time  harleysville group may encounter such disputes with its reinsurers 
in addit ion  the creditworthiness of our reinsurers could deteriorate in the future due to adverse events affecting the reinsurance industry  such as a large number of major catastrophes 
because of the nature of insurance claims  there are uncertainties inherent in the estimates of ultimate losses 
harleysville group s reorganization of its claims operation in recent years has resulted in new people and processes involved in settling claims 
as a result  more recent statistical data reflects different patterns than in the past and gives rise to uncertainty as to the pattern of future loss settlements 
there are uncertainties regarding future loss cost trends particularly related to medical treatments and automobile repair 
court decisions  regulatory changes and economic conditions can affect the ultimate cost of claims that occurred in the past 
accordingly  the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses will likely differ from the amount recorded at december  the property and casualty industry has had substantial aggregate loss experience from claims related to asbestos related illnesses  environmental remediation  product liability  mold  and other uncertain exposures 
harleysville group has not experienced significant losses from such claims 
in october  the company extended certain provisions in its stock purchase agreement of its subsidiary  harleysville insurance company hic  in which the seller originally guaranteed the adequacy of hic s acquired unpaid losses and loss settlement expense reserves  for an additional ten year period 
the original agreement called for a final settlement of the guaranteed reserves based on reported reserves as of december  a final settlement is now to occur based on guaranteed reserves as of december  the extension has no material impact on the company s financial statements 
effective for one year from july   the company s subsidiaries and the mutual company and its wholly owned subsidiaries renewed its catastrophe reinsurance which provides coverage ranging from to of up to million in excess of a retention of million for any given catastrophe 
harleysville group s pooling share of this coverage would range from to of up to million in excess of a retention of million for any given catastrophe 
pursuant to the terms of the treaty  the maximum recovery would be million for any catastrophe involving an insured loss equal to or greater than million 
harleysville group s pooling share of this maximum recovery would be million for any catastrophe involving an insured loss of million or greater 
the treaty includes reinstatement provisions providing for cove rage for a second catastrophe and requiring payment of an additional premium in the event of a first catastrophe occurring 
the income tax expense for the year ended december  includes the tax benefit of million associated with tax exempt income compared to million in the prior year 
underwriting expenses  including amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  primarily due to the pool change 
excluding the impact of the pool change  underwriting expenses decreased million primarily due to a decrease in headcount resulting from on going expense reduction initiatives and lower incentive compensation 
other income decreased million for the year ended december  primarily due to a million gain realized on the sale of the company s office building in traverse city  michigan in the second quarter of and a decrease of million in fees received in connection with the national flood insurance program 
compared to premiums earned decreased million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily composed of a decrease in premiums earned for commercial lines of million and a decrease of million in personal lines premiums earned 
the decrease in premiums earned for commercial lines was primarily due to a decrease in commercial auto premiums earned due to fewer policy counts and a decrease in earned premiums assumed from involuntary pools 
the decline in premiums earned for personal lines was primarily due to fewer policy counts 
the reduction in personal lines volume was driven primarily by a reduction of personal automobile business from the continued implementation of more stringent underwriting processes  partially offset by an increase in homeowners business due to higher average premiums 
investment income increased million for the year ended december   resulting from an increase in invested assets and a greater percentage of invested assets in fixed maturity securities 
net realized investment gains decreased million for the year ended december   primarily due to gains on the sale of equity securities in the second quarter of there were impairment charges of million in and no impairment charges in in april  bonds with an amortized cost of  were transferred from the held to maturity category to the available for sale category due to a significant deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer 
an impairment loss of  was recognized on this security 
the security was sold in the third quarter of at a gain of  income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in realized investment gains  partially offset by the increase in investment income and improved underwriting results 
the improved underwriting results in were primarily due to lower loss severity  lower catastrophe losses and lower underwriting expenses 
harleysville group s statutory combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  such decrease was due to improved underwriting results in commercial lines  partially offset by a lower underwriting gain in personal lines

favorable prior accident year development as well as improved underwriting results in the current accident year contributed to the decreases in the commercial auto and commercial multi peril lines of business 
the decrease in the commercial auto combined ratio was primarily due to the recognition of favorable development of million in  while favorable development of million was recognized in the decrease in the commercial multi peril combined ratio was due to improved underwriting results in the current accident year 
the decrease in the workers compensation combined ratio was primarily due to improved underwriting results in the current acciden t year 
the personal lines statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  primarily due to less favorable underwriting results in the current accident year

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of the ability to generate sufficient cash to meet cash obligations as they come due 
harleysville group s primary sources of cash are premium income  investment income and maturing investments 
cash outflows can be variable because of uncertainties regarding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses  either individually or in the aggregate 
accordingly  harleysville group maintains investment and reinsurance programs generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without forced sales of investments 
harleysville group models its exposure to catastrophes and has the ability to pay claims without selling held to maturity securities even for events having a low less than probability 
even in years of greater catastrophe frequency  harleysville group has been able to pay claims without liquidating any investments 
harleysville group has also considered scenarios of declines in revenue and increases in loss payments  and has the ability to meet cash requirements under such scenarios without selling held to maturity securities 
harleysville group s policy with respect to fixed maturity investments is to purchase only those that are of investment grade quality 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the amount includes million received in connection with the increase in pool participation effective january   offset by a decrease of million primarily due to a decrease in underwriting cash flow due to greater catastrophe loss payments and an increase in non catastrophe property loss payments 
net cash used by investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the change is primarily due to lower net purchases of investments due to the increase in cash used by financing activities  partially offset by the increase in cash provided by operating activities 
financing activities used net cash of million and million for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to an increase in the purchase of treasury stock in and an increase in dividends paid 
harleysville group s investment strategy is designed to complement and support the insurance operations 
harleysville group considers projected cash flow premiums  investment income  reinsurance programs  liability payout patterns  general expenses  large seasonal obligations  intercompany transfers  etc 
to assure that sufficient liquidity exists within harleysville group and the mutual company 
maintaining a regular maturity schedule in readily marketable securities is an essential part of addressing liquidity 
this regular maturity schedule is maintained in all interest rate environments 
after tax yield will be maximized consistent with safety and liquidity considerations by investment in taxable or tax exempt securities  depending on harleysville group s tax position 
in september  the company terminated its securities lending program whereby certain fixed maturity securities from the investment portfolio were loaned to other institutions for a short period of time in return for a fee

due to illiquid market conditions and deteriorating fundamentals in the housing industry  the value of some of the underlying assets that secure our position as a senior creditor in the sivs is uncertain at this time 
depending upon developments involving the performance of the assets held by the sivs  it is possible that the siv holdings listed above may be written down in the income statement in the future

the company had million of cash and marketable securities at december   which are available for general corporate purposes including dividends  debt service  capital contributions to subsidiaries  acquisitions and the repurchase of stock 
in june  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan under which up to million shares of its outstanding common stock could be repurchased through an open market purchase program 
the company was authorized to repurchase shares from the mutual company  which owned of the company s stock at that time  at fair market value terms on the date of purchase and from the public float in amounts that were proportional to the respective ownership percentages of the mutual company and the public float as of the authorization date 
this program was completed on july  on august   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase an additional million shares of its outstanding common stock over a two year period under terms similar to the first repurchase authorization

this program was completed on november  on february   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional  shares of its outstanding common stock over a two year period in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
additionally  the board authorized the company to make purchases under the terms of a rule b trading plan  which allows the company to purchase its shares at times when it ordinarily would not be in the market because of self imposed trading blackout periods  such as the time preceding its quarterly earnings releases 
the company currently intends to repurchase shares in open market transactions from the public float  and not repurchase shares from the mutual company

there were no borrowings under the credit facility 
the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants 
effective january   the company terminated this credit agreement because the company felt it was no longer needed 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted risk based capital rbc standards that require insurance companies to calculate and report statutory capital and surplus needs based on a formula measuring underwriting  investment and other business risks inherent in an individual company s operations 
these rbc standards have not affected the operations of harleysville group since each of the company s insurance subsidiaries has statutory capital and surplus in excess of rbc requirements 
these rbc standards require the calculation of a ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level 
insurers with a ratio below are subject to different levels of regulatory intervention and action 
based upon their statutory financial statements  the ratio of total adjusted capital to the authorized control level for the company s eight insurance subsidiaries at december  ranged from to 
the following summarizes harleysville group s contractual obligations at december  total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations debt interest on debt gross liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses total the table above does not include capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations or purchase obligations as they are either not applicable or not material 
the timing of the amounts for the gross liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses is an estimate based on historical experience and expectations of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts stated above 
property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and loss settlement expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses  are known 
consequently  harleysville group attempts  in establishing rates  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
in the past  inflation has contributed to increased losses and loss settlement expenses 
risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks  as well as the other information contained in this anual report on form k 
if any of the following events described in the risk factors below actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
you should refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
risks related to the property and casualty insurance industry generally if our estimated liability for losses and loss settlement expenses is incorrect  our reserves may not be adequate to cover our ultimate liability for losses and loss settlement expenses and may have to be increased 
we are required to maintain loss reserves for our estimated liability for losses and loss settlement expenses associated with reported and unreported claims for each accounting period 
we regularly review our reserving techniques and our overall amount of reserves and  based on our estimated liability  raise or lower the levels of our reserves accordingly 
if our estimates are incorrect and our reserves are inadequate  we are obligated to increase our reserves 
an increase in reserves results in an increase in losses and a reduction in our net income for the period in which the deficiency in reserves is identified 
accordingly  an increase in reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
our reserve amounts are estimated based on what we expect our ultimate liability for losses and loss settlement expenses to be 
these estimates are based on facts and circumstances of which we are aware  predictions of future events  trends in claims severity and frequency and other subjective factors 
although we use a number of actuarial methods to project our ultimate liability  there is no method that can always exactly predict our ultimate liability for losses and loss settlement expenses 
in addition to reviewing our reserving techniques  as part of our reserving process we also consider information regarding each claim for losses  our loss history and the industry s loss history  legislative enactments  judicial decisions and legal developments regarding damages  changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including inflation 
if certain catastrophic events occur  they could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
results of property insurers are subject to weather and other events prevailing in any given year 
while one year may be relatively free of major weather or other disasters  another year may have numerous such events causing results for that year to be materially worse than for other years 
our insurance subsidiaries have experienced  and are expected in the future to experience  catastrophe losses 
it is possible that a catastrophic event or a series of multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of our insurance subsidiaries  thereby limiting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us 
in the last years  the largest non flood catastrophe to affect our results of operations was hurricane floyd in the third quarter of  which resulted in million of losses 
in  we experienced losses totaling million from thirty two different catastrophes 
various events can cause catastrophes  including severe winter weather  hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  war  terrorism  explosions and fires 
the frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
our insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce the impact on our business of a catastrophe through geographic diversification and through the purchase of reinsurance covering various categories of catastrophes  which generally excludes terrorism 
nevertheless  reinsurance may prove inadequate if a major catastrophic loss exceeds the reinsurance limit or an insurance subsidiary pays a number of smaller catastrophic loss claims that  individually  fall below the subsidiary s retention level 
in addition  we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our property exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios 
these models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses 
we are heavily regulated in the states in which we operate and if we violate those regulations or if the regulations unreasonably restrict our ability to do business  or if they change significantly  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we transact business 
the purpose of supervision and regulation is to protect individual policyholders and not stockholders or other investors 
our business can be adversely affected by private passenger automobile insurance regulations and any other regulations affecting property and casualty insurance companies 
for example  laws and regulations can reduce or set rates at levels that we do not believe are adequate for the risks we insure 
other laws and regulations can limit our ability to cancel or refuse to renew policies and require us to offer coverage to all consumers 
changes in laws and regulations  or their interpretations  pertaining to insurance  including workers compensation  may also have an adverse effect on our business 
although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  federal initiatives  such as fede ral terrorism backstop legislation  from time to time  also can impact the insurance industry 
in addition  proposals intended to control the cost and availability of health care services have been debated in the us congress and state legislatures 
although we do not write health insurance  rules affecting health care services can affect other insurance that we write  including workers compensation and commercial and personal automobile and liability insurance 
we cannot determine whether or in what form health care reform legislation may be adopted by the us congress or any state legislature 
we also cannot determine the nature and effect  if any  that the adoption of health care legislation or regulations  or changing interpretations  at the federal or state level would have on us  including any changes to health care reimbursement or delivery systems that would arise under the american recovery and reinvestment act of  which was signed into law on february  if demand for property and casualty insurance decreases  it could have an adverse impact on our business 
historically  the results of the property and casualty insurance industry have been subject to significant fluctuations over time due to competition and due to unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment that affect returns on our investments  inflationary pressures that affect the size of losses  and legislative and regulatory changes and judicial decisions that affect insurers liabilities 
the demand for property and casualty insurance  particularly commercial lines  also can vary with the overall level of economic activity 
any of the foregoing could reduce the demand for property and casualty insurance  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  including on the amount of premiums earned in any fiscal quarter or fiscal year 
if we are unable to reduce our exposure to risks through reliable reinsurance or if the cost of reinsurance increases  our risk of loss  or the cost of controlling our risk of loss  will increase 
we transfer a portion of our exposure to selected risks to other insurance and reinsurance companies through reinsurance arrangements 
under our reinsurance arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of our losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly 
any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance will increase our risk of loss 
furthermore  we face a credit risk when we obtain reinsurance because we are still liable for the transferred risks if the reinsurer cannot meet the transferred obligations 
therefore  the inability of any of our reinsurers to meet its financial obligations could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
the threat of terrorism and military and other actions may result in decreases in our net income  revenue and assets under management and may adversely affect our investment portfolio 
the threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and declines in the equity markets in the united states  europe and elsewhere  as well as loss of life  property damage  additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
actual terrorist attacks could cause losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations of harleysville group  as well as a decrease in our stockholders equity  net income and or revenue 
the effects of changes related to harleysville group may result in a decrease in our stock price 
the terrorism risk insurance act of  which was originally extended in and extended again in  requires that some coverage for terrorist loss be offered by primary property insurers and provides federal assistan ce for recovery of claims through in addition  some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism  ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures 
we cannot predict at this time whether and the extent to which industry sectors in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of potential decreased commercial and economic activity  or how any such decrease might impact the ability of companies within the affected industry sectors to pay interest or principal on their securities  or how the value of any underlying collateral might be affected 
we can offer no assurances that the threats of future terrorist like events in the united states and abroad or military actions by the united states will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
certain changes in the accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies could have a material adverse impact on our reported net income 
we are subject to the application of us gaap and other accounting standards  which are periodically revised and or expanded 
as such  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the financial accounting standards board 
it is possible that future changes required to be adopted could change the current accounting treatment that we apply and such changes could result in material adverse impacts on our results of operations and financial condition 
if our investments lose value  our revenues  earnings and financial position will be adversely affected 
like many other property and casualty insurance companies  we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a significant portion of our revenues and earnings 
any significant decline in our investment income as a result of falling interest rates  decreased dividend payment rates or general market conditions would have an adverse effect on our results 
any significant decline in the market value of our investments would reduce our shareholders equity and our policyholders surplus  which could impact our ability to write additional business 
the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our business 
adverse capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  as well as our access to capital and cost of capital 
further  if adverse regional and national economic conditions persist or worsen  we could experience decreased revenues and shareholders equity 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than months 
in recent months  the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels and the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers 
our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets 
continued deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to investment losses 
the severe downturn in the public debt and equity markets  reflecting uncertainties associated with the mortgage crisis  worsening economic conditions  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in large financial institutions  has resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio 
depending on market conditions going forward  we could incur substantial additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition  debt and financial strength ratings and ability to access capital markets 
if our financial strength ratings are reduced  we may be adversely impacted 
insurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies 
higher ratings generally indicate greater financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
ratings are assigned by rating agencies to insurers based upon factors that they believe are relevant to policyholders 
ratings are not recommendations to buy  hold or sell our securities 
although other agencies cover the property and casualty industry  we believe our ability to write business is most influenced by our rating from a 
m 
best 
according to a 
m 
best  its ratings are designed to assess an insurer s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing policyholder obligations 
currently  our rating from a 
m 
best is a  the th of a 
m 
best s ratings 
a rating below a from a 
m 
best could materially adversely affect the business we write 
we believe that our financial strength ratings from moody s which is a  the th of moody s ratings  and standard poor s which is a  the rd of standard poor s ratings although important  have less of an impact on our business 
an unfavorable change in our moody s or standard poor s financial strength rating  however  could make it more expensive for us to access capital markets 
we cannot be sure that we will maintain our current a 
m 
best  moody s or standard poor s ratings 
standard poor s rates our debt securities at bbb stable the th of standard poor s ratings 
risks related to our company in particular we face significant competition from other regional and national insurance companies  agents and from self insurance  which may result in lower revenues 
we compete with local  regional and national insurance companies  including direct writers of insurance coverage 
many of these competitors are larger than we are and many have greater financial  technical and operating resources 
in addition  we face competition within each insurance agency that sells our insurance because we sell through independent agencies that represent more than one insurance company 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis of product  price and service 
if our competitors offer products with more coverage  or price their products more aggressively  our ability to grow or renew our business may be adversely impacted 
there are more than groups writing property and casualty insurance in the united states  and we rank among the top in size 
our most significant competitors vary significantly in our different lines of business and in the geographic markets in which we compete 
the internet also could emerge as a significant source of new competition  both from existing competitors using their brand name and resources to write business through this distribution channel and from new competitors 
we also face competition because of entities that self insure  primarily in the commercial insurance market 
from time to time  certain of our customers and potential customers may examine the benefits and risks of self insurance and other alternatives to traditional insurance 
a number of new  proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in the property and casualty insurance industry 
these developments include the enactment of the gramm leach bliley act of  which could result in increased competition from new entrants to the insurance market  including banks and other financial service companies  programs in which state sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage  and changing practices caused by the internet  which have led to greater competition in the insurance business and  in some cases  greater expectations for customer service 
new competition from these developments could cause the supply or demand for insurance to change  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if adverse conditions in the eastern and midwestern united states exist  our business would be disproportionately impacted 
we primarily write property and casualty insurance business in the eastern and midwestern united states 
consequently  unusually severe storms or other natural or man made disasters that destroy property in these states could adversely affect our operations 
our revenues and profitability also are subject to prevailing economic and regulatory conditions in the states in which we write insurance 
we may be exposed to risks of adverse developments that are greater than if we conducted business nationwide 
we depend on independent insurance agents  which exposes us to risks not applicable to companies with dedicated agents 
we market and sell our insurance products through independent  non exclusive insurance agencies 
these agencies are not obligated to sell our insurance products  and generally they also sell our competitors insurance products 
as a result  our business depends in part on the marketing and sales efforts of these agencies 
if we diversify and expand our business geographically  then we may need to expand our network of agencies to successfully market our products 
if these agencies fail to market our products successfully  our business may be adversely impacted 
also  independent agents may decide to sell their businesses to banks  other insurance agencies or other businesses 
changes in ownership of agencies  or expansion of agencies through acquisition  could adversely affect an agency s ability to control growth and profitability  thereby adversely affecting our business 
if our insurance subsidiaries are not able to pay adequate dividends to us  our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends would be affected 
our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries 
we principally rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying corporate expenses and dividends to stockholders 
the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries  as well as other regulatory restrictions 
as a result  we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or to allow us to pay dividends 
if insurance regulators determine that payment of a dividend to an affiliate would be detrimental to an insurance subsidiary s policyholders or creditors  because of the financial condition of the insurance subsidiary or otherwise  the regulators may block dividends to affiliates that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval 
our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of our debt agreement for our million notes due to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends or the making of loans by our subsidiaries to us 
we cannot assure you that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends  distributions or loans to fund payments on these notes when due 
although we have paid cash dividends in the past  we may not be able to pay cash dividends in the future 
we have a history of paying dividends to our stockholders when sufficient cash is available 
however  future cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements and other factors  including the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us  which ability is restricted in the manner previously discussed in this section 
also  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution 
if our use of predictive modeling is not effective  our business could be adversely impacted 
we use predictive modeling in underwriting a significant portion of our commercial lines business 
we believe this tool allows us to more accurately match underwriting risk with pricing to operate more profitably 
if the model does not accurately reflect the level of losses that we ultimately will incur  our ability to write business and our financial results could be adversely affected 
if our technology initiatives are not successful  or the benefits are not realized  our business could be adversely affected 
our businesses are increasingly dependent on technology 
our inability to anticipate or manage problems with technology  or fully realize the expected benefits from investments in technology  could adversely affect our ability to write business and could adversely impact our financial results 
if we lose our key personnel our business could be adversely affected 
the success of our business is dependent  to a large extent  on our ability to attract and retain key employees  in particular our senior officers and key management  sales  information systems  underwriting  claims and corporate personnel 
competition to attract and retain key personnel is intense 
although we have change of control agreements with a number of key managers  in general  we do not have employment contracts or non compete arrangements with  or key person insurance covering  our employees  including our key employees 
applicable insurance laws and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company  and the mutual company has significant influence over potential change of control transactions  which could affect our share value 
under applicable insurance laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled  no person may acquire control of us unless that person has filed a statement containing specified information with the insurance commissioner of each state and obtains advance approval for such acquisition 
under applicable laws and regulations  any person acquiring  directly or indirectly by revocable proxy or otherwise  or more of the voting stock of any other person is presumed to have acquired control of such person  and a person who beneficially acquires or more of our common stock without obtaining advance approval of the insurance commissioner of each state would be in violation of applicable insurance laws and would be subject to injunctive action requiring disposition or seizure of the shares and prohibiting the voting of such shares  as well as other action determined by the insurance commissioner of each su ch state 
in addition  many state insurance laws require prior notification to the state insurance department of a change of control of a non domiciliary insurance company licensed to transact an insurance business in that state 
although these pre notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove the change of control  they authorize regulatory action including a possible revocation of our authority to do business in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration 
any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of us may require prior notification in the states that have pre acquisition notification laws 
as of december   the mutual company owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the mutual company s stock ownership and ability  by reason of such ownership  to elect our board of directors  provides it with significant influence over potential change of control transactions 
further  section of the delaware general corporation law provides that if a person acquires or more of our voting stock  the person is an interested stockholder and may not engage in business combinations with us for a period of three years from the time the person acquired or more of our voting stock  subject to certain exceptions 
section may discourage a potential change of control transaction 
our board of directors is divided into three classes a  b and c 
the current three year terms of class a  b and c directors expire in  and  respectively 
this classif ication of our board of directors could have the effect of discouraging a potential change in control transaction 
finally  our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock having such terms  including voting rights  as the board of directors shall fix and determine
