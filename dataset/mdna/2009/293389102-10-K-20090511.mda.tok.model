we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to allowance for doubtful receivables  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  pension plan  accrued liabilities and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical due to their affect on our more significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan for employees 
included in our financial results are pension costs that are measured using actuarial valuations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results 
as our pension assets are invested in marketable securities  fluctuations in market values could potentially impact our funding status and associated liability recorded 
amounts allocated to intangibles are determined based on valuation analysis for our acquisitions and are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we evaluate these amounts periodically at least once a year to determine whether the value has been impaired by events occurring during the fiscal year 
we exercise judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets that include other intangible assets  goodwill  and property  plant  and equipment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing tests of impairment  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the future 
actual results could differ from assumptions made by management 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million and million of goodwill and trademarks  respectively 
we believe our businesses will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to recover the investments we have made in property  plant and equipment  as well as the goodwill and other intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisitions 
however  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
see risk factor in we were required to write down goodwill and other 
table of contents intangible assets and we may have similar charges in the future  which could cause our financial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future on page of the report for further discussion 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of products 
net sales consist of gross sales invoiced to customers  less certain related charges  including discounts  returns and other allowances 
returns  discounts and other allowances have historically been insignificant 
in some cases and upon customer request  we print and store custom print product for customer specified future delivery  generally within twelve months 
in this case  risk of loss from obsolescence passes to the customer  the customer is invoiced under normal credit terms and revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete 
approximately million  million  and million of revenue were recognized under these agreements during fiscal years ended february   february   and february  respectively 
derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value as determined under financial accounting standard no 
 fair value measurements 
changes in fair values of derivatives are accounted for based upon their intended use and designation 
when utilized  interest rate swaps are held for purposes other than trading 
the company utilized swap agreements related to its term and revolving loans to effectively fix the interest rate for a specified principal amount 
the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges  and the after tax effect of the mark to market valuation that relates to the effective amount of derivative financial instruments was recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with the offset included in long term debt 
we entered into a million interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge related to our variable rate financial instruments 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement recorded in the consolidated balance sheet  excluding accrued interest  at february   was a liability of approximately million 
there were no derivatives  swaps or deferred gains or losses at february  we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based upon historical collection trends  current economic factors  and the assessment of the collectability of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of specific accounts using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balances  evaluation of customers current and past financial condition and credit scores  recent payment history  current economic environment  discussions with our project managers  and discussions with the customers directly 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory values on hand  using specific aging categories  and write down inventory deemed obsolete and or slow moving based on historical usage and estimated future usage to its estimated market value 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
in addition to the above  we also have to make assessments as to the adequacy of our accrued liabilities  more specifically our liabilities recorded in connection with our workers compensation and health insurance  as these plans are self funded 
to help us in this evaluation process  we routinely get outside third party assessments of our potential liabilities under each plan 
in view of such uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 

table of contents results of operations consolidated overview 
our results of operations for the second half of fiscal year ended was significantly affected by the recent economic downturn 
both our print segment and apparel segment saw double digit volume declines during the final quarter of the year which placed extreme pressure on each segment s operating margins 
our apparel sector continues to be impacted by the sluggish retail landscape which  along with a reduction in retail inventory levels  has contributed to what we believed to be a temporary increase in inventory at the manufacturer level 
this resulted in intensified pricing pressures in the marketplace  from both domestic and international competitors 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we commenced cost reduction initiatives in both our segments and will continue to adjust our costs to coincide with projected volume levels 
these steps help to mitigate  but not fully offset  the negative impacts associated with this economic downturn during the fourth quarter 
in addition  due to the significant stock market devaluation experienced this fiscal year  we were required to take a non cash impairment charge of million and million to goodwill and trademarks  respectively during the fourth quarter of fiscal net sales 
our net sales for fiscal year were million  compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or our print segment sales decreased by approximately million  or during the period while our apparel segment sales decreased million  or 
our sales for the period were impacted by the significant economic downturn experienced during the past quarter  as our sales for the nine months ended november  were up million  or

cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold for fiscal year was approximately million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales for fiscal year the decrease in our cost of sales  on a dollar basis relates primarily to our decreased sales volume during the period 
the increase in our cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  related primarily to our apparel segment  which experienced significant cost side pressures relating to material  freight  chemical and utilities during the period  as well as sell side pressures due to retail inventory strategies and excess inventory levels at manufacturers 
as a result  our overall gross profit margin net sales less cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year our apparel margins decreased from to  while our print margins decreased from to  for fiscal years and  respectively 
our apparel margins were especially impacted during the fourth quarter  by the abrupt turndown in the economy which throttled demand at the retail level creating excess inventory at the manufacturing level which put further pricing pressures in the marketplace 
see results of operations segments of this report for further discussion 
our cost of goods sold for fiscal year was approximately million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales for fiscal year the increase in our cost of sales during fiscal year  on a dollar basis relates primarily to our increased sales volume as previously discussed

selling  general  and administrative expenses 
for fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  or from million  or of sales for fiscal year to million  or of sales for fiscal year on a dollar basis  these expenses decreased primarily as a result of our cost reduction initiatives  lower employment and factoring expenses  offset by higher bad debt expense  associated with the bankruptcy filing of a large apparel customer and higher health insurance expense 
on a percentage basis  these expenses increased primarily as a result of our decline in sales during the period 
for fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales for fiscal year  or an increase of million  or 
on a dollar and percentage basis  these expenses increased primarily as a result of our acquisitions and the increase in our 
table of contents miscellaneous expenses  which was attributable to a significant increase in our credit card fees due to increased usage of credit purchase cards by our customers 
gain from disposal of assets 
the gain from disposal of assets of  for fiscal year ended february  resulted from  gain from sale of vacant facilities and  gain from sale of equipment 
the gain from disposal of assets of  for the fiscal year ended february  resulted primarily from the sale of two print manufacturing facilities located in dallas  texas 
impairment of goodwill and trademarks 
after conducting our annual impairment testing  we determined million of goodwill and million trademarks associated with our apparel segment was impaired 
the impairment charge is primarily the result of the current adverse economic conditions and the resulting impact on the financial market valuation multiples 
income from operations 
our income from operations for fiscal year decreased from operational earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year  to an operational loss of million  or of sales for fiscal year the dollar decrease in our operational earnings during fiscal year  related primarily to the non cash impairment charge of million and decrease in sales as discussed previously 
our earnings from operations for fiscal year increased by approximately million  or  from operational earnings of million in fiscal year to operational earnings of million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  our operational earnings were for fiscal year and for fiscal year  respectively 
the increase in our operational earnings  on a dollar basis  during fiscal year related primarily to the increase in sales due to our acquisitions of trade and b d in fiscal year and full year revenue associated with our fiscal year acquisition of block 
the slight decrease in our operational earnings  as a percentage of sales  related primarily to the increase of selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal year as previously discussed 
other income and expense our interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our interest expense decreased in fiscal year and due to less debt on average being outstanding for each prior fiscal year and a lower effective borrowing rate during fiscal year provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for was due to a non deductible goodwill impairment charge of million

the increase in our overall effective tax rate during fiscal year related primarily to an increase in our effective foreign and state income tax rates

table of contents print segment 
the print segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years   and  respectively 
our net sales for the print segment were approximately million for fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year  or a decrease of million  or 
the decline in our print segment s sales for the period occurred primarily during the last quarter  where sales were down million or over the comparable period last year  and was due to the significant decline in the economy during the quarter 
the decrease was partially offset by increased sales from our acquisition of b d  skyline and trade which were acquired october  and september   respectively 
the positive impact of these acquired entities on sales was million for the fiscal year ended february  sales from our traditional print plants continue to be impacted by the general economic conditions and the continued contraction of traditional business forms which occurs as customers continue to migrate away from traditional printed business form products due to technological advancements 
our net sales for the print segment were approximately million for fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year  or an increase of million  or 
the increase in the print segment s net sales for the fiscal year related primarily to our acquisition of b d and trade and the full year impact of our acquisition of block graphics  inc block which was acquired on august  net sales for the acquired entities were million for the fiscal year ended compared to million for the fiscal year ended the impact of the increase in sales from our acquired entities was offset by the planned attrition of low margin print sales and the decline in our commercial print operations over comparable periods last year due to the impact of the loss of two large promotional customers 
while this impacted our sales during fiscal year by approximately million  we feel the impact associated with these accounts has matured as the sales in our commercial print operations during the last six months of fiscal year ended has been above comparable sales levels last year 
due to the contracting nature of the print industry  our traditional print plants saw their sales decline by approximately million  or during fiscal year apparel segment 
the apparel segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years  and respectively 
our fiscal year net sales for the apparel segment was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal year  or a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in our apparel sales for the current fiscal year is the result of decreased sales during the fourth quarter where apparel sales were down million  or 
our apparel segment continues to be impacted by the sluggish retail landscape which has contributed to inventory levels being reduced at the retail level and correspondingly increased at the manufacturers level 
this resulted in intensified pricing pressures in the marketplace  from both domestic and international competitors during the fourth quarter  which placed additional pressures on top lines and on operational margins 
for fiscal year  our apparel segment net sales were approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal year  or an increase of million  or 
the increase in the apparel segment s net sales during fiscal year was primarily due to increased volume associated with new customers and increased sales to existing customers 
management believes that the apparel sales during fiscal year were negatively impacted during the first six months by lower inventory levels at the beginning of the fiscal year  which hindered the apparel segment s ability to capture certain opportunity sales during this period 
traditionally  the apparel segment rebuilds its inventory levels in the last half of the fiscal year for the upcoming summer buying season due to the normal falloff of demand during the winter season 
however  during the second half of fiscal year  demand was at or above forecasted sales levels 
as a result  production levels were only able to stay abreast of then current sales levels  which resulted in inventory levels not being as robust in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as during the same period the previous fiscal year 
consequently  several initiatives were implemented during the first and second quarters of fiscal year to improve the apparel segment s inventory levels and to meet forecasted demand 
significant progress was made on these initiatives during the second and third quarters of fiscal year and the apparel segment s inventory levels during the third quarter were significantly improved  which management believes allowed the apparel sales to return to more normalized sales growth levels during the third and fourth quarters during the third quarter and during the fourth quarter 

table of contents fiscal years ended gross profit by segment in thousands print apparel total print segment 
our print segment s gross profit decreased approximately million  or for fiscal year the decrease in gross profit  on a dollar basis  relates primarily to the decline in our sales as previously discussed 
as a percentage of sales  our gross profit decreased from during fiscal year to during fiscal year the decrease in our print margin  as a percentage of sales  related primarily to increased material and freight costs which have not been fully passed onto to our customers because of contractual obligations and or timing of the increases  product mix changes  and lower absorption due to our lower volume 
while costs increases have impacted our margins  we have been able  for the most part  to effectively offset these costs increases during the period through improved operational efficiencies

apparel segment 
our apparel segment s gross profit decreased approximately million  or for fiscal year and decreased approximately million or for fiscal year as a percentage of sales  our gross profit was   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our margins during fiscal year were significantly impacted by the severe economic downturn experienced during our fourth quarter  and the resulting impact on inventory levels and competitors pricing strategies 
in addition  our margins were negatively impacted by significant raw material price increases  as well as freight  chemical and energy costs increases during the period 
while several price increases occurred during the first six months of fiscal year  these increases only partially covered the actual costs increases incurred during this period 
in addition  customer mix changes ie  more sales to larger lower pricing tiered customers  and product mix changes ie  shift in sales to lower profit margin items also impacted the reported margin during this period 
during the second half of the year  due to the severe economic downturn  retailers significantly reduced their on hand inventory levels  which in turn resulted in increased inventory at the manufacturing level 
this resulted in increased pricing pressures in the market place  at a time when manufacturers were still trying to recoup their material production cost increases experienced during the first six months of the year 
as a result  manufacturers top lines were impacted two fold by a reduction in units sold  and by a reduction in selling price  which placed additional strains on manufacturers margins during the fourth quarter 
in addition  margins were further impacted during the period by lower manufacturing levels as manufacturers adjusted their production to demand levels which decreased their manufacturing absorption factors 
our apparel segment wasn t immune to this  as we saw our margins decline from to on a comparable th quarter basis 
our apparel margins during the fiscal year were impacted mainly by the increased costs associated with our apparel inventory build  and to a lesser extent by higher cotton prices during our fourth quarter and lower selling prices on certain products due to competitive pressures 
during the first nine months of fiscal year and in connection with our inventory build initiative  we incurred approximately million in additional overtime charges  million in additional temporary labor charges and million in additional cut sew costs  all of which had a negative impact on our reported margins 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we saw cotton prices increase significantly  and while we increased selling prices during this period to offset a portion of this cost increase  our margins were negatively impacted
