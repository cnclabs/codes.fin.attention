item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and commercialize a broad suite of ivus and fm products 
we believe that these products enhance the diagnosis and treatment of vascular heart disease by improving the efficiency and efficacy of existing pci therapy procedures in the coronary or peripheral arteries 
we market our products to physicians and technicians who perform pci procedures in hospitals and to other personnel who make purchasing decisions on behalf of hospitals 
our ivus products consist of ultrasound consoles  single procedure disposable phased array and rotational ivus imaging catheters and additional functionality options such as virtual histology  or vh  ivus tissue characterization and chromaflo stent apposition analysis 
our ivus consoles are marketed as stand alone units or customized units that can be integrated into a variety of hospital based interventional surgical suites called catheterization laboratories  or cath labs 
we have developed customized cath lab versions of these consoles and are developing additional functionality options as part of our cath lab integration initiative 
our ivus consoles have been designed to serve as a multi modality platform for our phased array and rotational ivus catheters  ffr pressure wires and medtronic s pioneer reentry device 
we are developing additional offerings for integration into the platform  including  flivus catheters  image guided therapy catheters and ultra high resolution oct systems and catheters 
our fm offerings include consoles and single use pressure and flow guide wires used to measure the pressure and flow characteristics of blood around plaque enabling physicians to gauge the plaque s physiological impact on blood flow and pressure 
we have focused on building our domestic and international sales and marketing infrastructure to market our products to physicians and technicians who perform pci procedures in hospitals and to other personnel who make purchasing decisions on behalf of hospitals 
we expanded our worldwide sales organization from employees in july to employees at december   which included direct sales representatives in the united states  western europe and asia 
we sell our products directly to customers in certain european markets and utilize distributors in other european markets  including spain  portugal and parts of italy 
at december   our distribution efforts in europe were led by a general manager  a director of european sales  account representatives and three clinical specialists 
three companies distribute our ivus and fm products in japan 
we have direct contractual relationships with goodman  fukuda denshi and johnson johnson through which our ivus and fm products are distributed in japan 
in addition  fukuda denshi has sub distribution agreements with other parties 
while these multi level relationships allow us to access specific customers and markets  they create complex distribution arrangements and increase our reliance on our japanese distributors 
as of december   we support our japanese 
table of contents distributors through volcano japan which is led by a general manager  two marketing  three distribution  and sales and support staff 
in emerging markets  including the major markets of asia pacific  latin america  europe  australia  africa and the middle east  we have distributor relationships through which we sell our products 
our distributors are involved in product launch planning  education and training  physician support and clinical trial management 
fukuda denshi accounted for of our revenues in and accounted for less than of our revenues in and in the first quarter of  goodman  formerly boston scientific s distributor of its ivus products in japan  began to distribute our ivus products in japan through a sub distribution agreement with fukuda denshi 
additionally  fukuda denshi transferred the japanese regulatory approvals  or shonins  for our phased array ivus products to us on june  due to the transfer  we are now able to sell directly to distributors in japan as opposed to being required to sell our phased array ivus products only to fukuda denshi 
as a result  for a portion of  we sold directly to goodman and fukuda denshi and the percentage of our revenues attributable to fukuda denshi declined  while the percentage of revenues attributed to goodman increased  accounting for   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on may   we and goodman  mutually terminated the exclusive distribution agreement  dated september   pursuant to which goodman distributed our ivus products in japan 
also on may   the oral agreement between us and goodman  related to the exclusive distribution of our fm products in japan  was terminated 
we did not pay and we are not obligated to pay a termination fee in connection with this termination 
on june   goodman transferred to us all marketing authorization and other regulatory approvals  or shonins  for all specified products held by goodman or its affiliates 
although goodman currently continues to distribute our rotational ivus and fm products in japan on a non exclusive  purchase order basis  there is no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future 
upon termination of our agreements with goodman  we monitor the credit risk associated with goodman as well as other general economic conditions and  accordingly  we have made and continue to make adjustments to the credit terms that are extended to goodman 
we are also collaborating with ge for the development and distribution worldwide  except japan  of our si ge innova system  which is our ivus imaging system console that is installed directly into a cath lab on a permanent basis and is able to be integrated with ge s innova system 
at december   we had a worldwide installed base of over  ivus consoles and over fm consoles 
we intend to grow and leverage this installed base to drive recurring sales of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires 
in  the sale of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires accounted for million  or of our revenues  a million  or increase from  in which the sale of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires accounted for million  or of our revenues 
we manufacture our ivus and fm consoles  ivus catheters and fm guide wires at our facility in rancho cordova  california 
we use third party manufacturing partners to produce circuit boards and mechanical sub assemblies used in the manufacture of our consoles 
we also use third party manufacturing partners for certain proprietary components used in the manufacture of our single procedure disposable products 
we perform incoming inspection on these circuit boards  mechanical sub assemblies and components  assemble them into finished products  and test the final product to assure quality control 
our former supplier of fm wire pressure sensors ceased production of this key component on wafers 
we secured an end of life purchase in of the subject parts equivalent to an estimated four year supply 
we believe this will provide us with adequate time to initiate and qualify a replacement supplier or a new design to replace the product 
we expect that it will take approximately months to identify an appropriate replacement supplier  complete design work and undertake the necessary inspections before the new pressure sensors will be available 

table of contents from our inception in january until july  we were engaged principally in the research and development of tools designed to diagnose vulnerable plaque 
in july  we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the ivus and fm product lines of jomed  inc we also acquired certain ivus patents and technology from philips in july these purchases were significant in executing our strategy to leverage our ivus technology and build our business 
our revenues have increased from million in to million in to million in our operating loss increased from million in to million in  which included a million charge related to in process research and development acquired as part of the acquisition of cardiospectra  then decreased to million in  which included a million charge related to in process research and development acquired as part of the novelis acquisition 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
since our inception  we have not been profitable for a full fiscal year  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we completed an underwritten initial public offering on june  in which we sold  shares of our common stock to the public at an offering price of per share 
the initial public offering resulted in net proceeds of million  after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 
on december   we completed an underwritten follow on offering in which  shares of our common stock were sold by the company and  shares were sold by certain selling stockholders  including officers of the company 
in addition  we sold  shares under an over allotment option exercised by the underwriters 
the follow on offering  including the exercise of the over allotment option  resulted in net proceeds to the company of million  after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 
on october   we completed an underwritten follow on offering in which  shares of our common stock were sold by the company  including  shares under an over allotment option exercised by the underwriters 
the follow on offering  including the exercise of the over allotment option  resulted in net proceeds to the company of million  after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 
during the second half of and the first quarter of  we pursued an acquisition with an interventional therapy company 
given the other entity s complex legal structure  global revenue base and lack of us gaap financial statements  the due diligence and deal related costs were unusually high 
we were not able to reach a final definitive agreement and  during the year ended december   we expensed approximately million in third party costs incurred during the due diligence process 
on december   we acquired cardiospectra  a company founded in and based in san antonio  texas 
cardiospectra s core product line is based on technology licensed from the university of texas and dr 
thomas milner  a co founder of cardiospectra 
through cardiospectra  we are developing innovative oct technology  which is expected to complement our existing product offerings and further enhance our position as an imaging technology leader in the field of interventional medicine 
on may   we acquired novelis  a company with proprietary ultrasonic visualization and therapy technology for minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic devices 
novelis proprietary flivus technology platform is expected to build upon our existing suite of products and further enhance our position as an imaging technology leader in the field of interventional medicine by enabling flivus and associated therapies in the interventional cardiology market 
we expect to add the novelis products and capability onto our si multi modality integrated platform hub 
on december   we acquired axsun  a company that develops and manufactures optical monitors for telecommunications  lasers and optical engines used in medical oct imaging systems and advanced photonic components and subsystems used in spectroscopy and other industrial applications 
we believe axsun s 
table of contents proprietary oct technology will provide us competitive advantages in the invasive imaging sector 
in connection with the axsun acquisition  we and axsun were sued by lightlab 
lightlab is a wholly owned subsidiary of goodman  our distributor of ivus and fm products in japan  and lightlab develops and sells oct products for cardiovascular imaging and other medical uses 
we believe the complaint is without merit and we intend to opposed the preliminary injunction motion and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
financial operations overview the following is a description of the primary components of our revenue and expenses 
revenues 
we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our ivus and fm consoles and single procedure disposables 
in  of our revenues were derived from the sale of our ivus consoles and ivus single procedure disposables  as compared with in and in in  of our revenues were derived from the sale of our ivus and fm single procedure disposables  as compared with in and in other revenues consist primarily of spare parts sales  service and maintenance revenues  shipping and handling revenues and license fees from medtronic  a related party 
fukuda denshi accounted for of our revenues in goodman accounted for   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our sales in the united states are generated by our direct sales representatives and our products are shipped and billed to hospitals throughout the united states from our facility in rancho cordova  california 
our international sales are generated by our direct sales representatives or through independent distributors and are shipped and billed throughout the world from our facilities in rancho cordova  california  zaventem  belgium and chiba  japan 
we experienced a significant increase in our ivus consoles  ivus single procedure disposables and fm single procedure disposables revenues from compared with  offset slightly by a decline in our fm consoles business which represents a shift towards our integrated ivus console product offerings that incorporate the features of our fm consoles 
we expect to experience variability in our quarterly revenues from ivus and fm consoles due to the timing of hospital capital equipment purchasing decisions  a condition which is inherent in our industry 
further  we expect variability of our revenues based on the timing of our new product introductions which may cause our customers to delay their purchasing decisions until the new products are commercially available 
alternatively  we may include in our arrangements with customers an obligation to deliver new products which are not yet commercially available 
in these cases  we would be required to defer associated revenues from these customers until we have met our delivery obligations 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of material costs for the products that we sell and other costs associated with our manufacturing process such as personnel costs  rent and depreciation 
in addition  cost of revenues includes royalty expenses for licensed technologies included in our products  service costs  provisions for warranty  distribution  freight and packaging costs and stock compensation expense 
we expect our gross margin for ivus and fm products to improve if we are able to complete our ongoing efforts to streamline and improve our manufacturing processes and increase production volumes 
we expect our overall gross margins to decrease due to the acquisition of axsun and the lower gross margin on their product lines 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the sales  marketing  executive  finance  information technology and human resource functions 
other costs include travel and entertainment expenses  facility costs  trade show  training and other promotional expenses  professional fees for legal and accounting services and stock compensation expense 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to expand our sales force and marketing efforts and invest in the necessary infrastructure to support our continued growth 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  consultants  prototype materials  clinical studies  depreciation  regulatory filing fees  certain legal costs related to our intellectual property and stock compensation expense 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our products and technologies 
in process research and development 
in process research development  or ipr d  consists of our projects acquired in connection with acquisitions that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of each acquisition date 
in december  we acquired the oct project in connection with our acquisition of cardiospectra  which was valued at million 
in vivo testing and regulatory approval remained to be completed as of the acquisition date at an estimated cost of million 
in addition  milestone payments of up to million may be paid in connection with successful and timely regulatory approvals and commercialization 
the oct project was expected to be commercialized by late our initial assessment of the stage of completion of the oct project at the acquisition date was underestimated 
as of december   the oct project in vivo testing had begun and commercialization was behind schedule by approximately two years 
in addition  we expect additional costs to complete the oct project of approximately million 
we believe the current schedule is attainable and consistent with deadlines associated with milestone payments 
however  if the oct project is not completed in a timely manner  such as if we experience delays associated with significant design changes that result from unsuccessful human trials or discoveries during human trials  we may jeopardize a potential competitive advantage  experience difficulties in obtaining our forecasted revenues and associated market share and we may not be required to pay some or all of the milestone payments 
in may  we acquired the flivus project in connection with our acquisition of novelis  which was valued at million 
in vivo testing and regulatory approval protocols remained to be completed for the flivus project as of the acquisition date  at an estimated cost of million 
we expected the flivus project to receive regulatory approvals and be commercialized during as of december   the project was on schedule 
however  if the flivus project is not completed in a timely manner  such as if we experience delays associated with significant design changes that result from unsuccessful human trials or discoveries during human trials  we may jeopardize a potential competitive advantage and experience a potential loss of revenues and associated market share 
in november  we acquired an ipr d project in connection with our acquisition of impact medical technologies  llc  a minor acquisition  valued at approximately  the following table summarizes our significant ipr d projects project name fair value estimated cost to complete  as of acquisition date oct million million flivus million million amortization of intangibles

for those jurisdictions in which we believe there is sufficient uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no current benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss and other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established at december   and to reflect these uncertainties 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in  the state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in  unless these net operating losses are previously utilized 
we also have federal research and experimentation tax credits  which begin to expire in  and state research and experimentation tax credits  which carry forward indefinitely

our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and growth of inventory  expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development infrastructure and other working capital needs  expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity and improving our manufacturing efficiency  capital expenditures related to the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets  cash used to repay our debt obligations and related interest expense  and cash used for acquisitions 
other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include significant increases in our product revenue  resulting in gross margins of   and in the years ended december    and  respectively  and fluctuations in our working capital due to timing differences of our cash receipts and cash disbursements

future liquidity needs our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  include expenditures related to medical diagnostic equipment that we own and place at our customers premises  our facilities expansion needs  including costs of leasing additional facilities and associated tenant improvements  the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities  upgrades to our information technology infrastructure to enhance our capabilities and improve overall productivity  support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources in the united states and abroad  particularly in japan where our strategy is to pursue a direct sales model  the continued advancement of research and development activities  improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  and acquisitions of technologies that enhance our capabilities or compliment our markets 
our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control 
we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income  as well as the status of each of our new product development programs  will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
at december   we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and our short term available for sale investments will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and operations for at least the next twelve months 
we intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
at the present time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 

table of contents our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors  including the extent and duration of future operating losses  the level and timing of future sales and expenditures  the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs  working capital required to support our sales growth  the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  our sales and marketing programs  the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace  competing technologies and changes in the market and regulatory environment 
our ability to fund our longer term cash needs is subject to various risks  many of which are beyond our control see risk factors 
should we require additional funding  such as additional capital investments  we may need to raise the required additional funds through bank borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
we cannot assure that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
at december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income if we become profitable 
pursuant to internal revenue code section  use of net operating loss carryforwards related to acquisitions of approximately million is limited 
we expect to utilize our available net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax obligations in the event we are successful in achieving profitability 
however  future limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other minimum state taxes may increase our overall tax obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations in conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business  we provide standard indemnification to business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for patent  copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products 
the term of these indemnification arrangements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited 
at december   we have not incurred any costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  for each of the periods indicated in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations and commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years debt capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations minimum payments under license agreements non cancelable purchase commitments total we lease office space and have entered into other lease commitments in the united states as well as locations in europe and asia 
operating lease obligations include future minimum lease payments under all our non cancelable operating leases at december  our license agreements include provisions that require us to make milestone or royalty payments to the licensor based on the amount of future sales of covered products 
certain of these agreements require that the royalties we pay in a given year total at least a minimum amount as set forth in the agreements 
the royalty obligations we may incur in excess of these minimum amounts are not included in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine the timing or amount of these obligations 

table of contents consists of non cancelable commitments primarily for the purchase of production materials 
the table above does not include potential milestone payments up to an aggregate of million due to the former shareholders of cardiospectra  million potentially due to the former shareholders of novelis see acquisitions note to our consolidated financial statements  and up to million in payments for a clinical research support agreement which is billed as services are performed 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more subjective and complex 
in order to provide an understanding about how our management forms its judgments about future events  including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates  and the sensitivity of those judgments to different circumstances  we have identified our critical accounting policies below 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our products is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer upon shipment  the terms of which are generally free on board shipping point 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify that title has transferred 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables  and for these we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we are required to make judgments which impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
for example  because the sale of our products and services are often contemplated in a single arrangement  we make judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from the arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement  the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
in addition  our ability to establish and maintain objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the elements in our arrangements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
the elements of a typical revenue arrangement can include a console  options for the console  single procedure disposable products and a service and maintenance agreement 
we occasionally enter into agreements requiring cash payments to partners who are also customers 
we apply the provisions of eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  to account for cash payments made under these agreements 
inventory valuation we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out basis 
we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to obsolescence and reductions in estimated future demand 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory 
table of contents levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when we sell products 
valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which are generally three to five years  and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  which is between three and ten years 
the straight line method is used for depreciation and amortization 
intangible assets primarily consist of developed technology  customer relationships  licenses  and patents and trademarks  which are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to ten years  representing the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we capitalize external legal costs and filing fees associated with obtaining patents on our new discoveries and amortize these costs using the straight line method over the shorter of the legal life of the patent or its economic life  generally ten years 
acquired intellectual property is recorded at cost and is amortized over its estimated useful life 
we believe the useful lives we assigned to these assets are reasonable 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired 
the estimates used to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
intangible assets  consisting of acquired technology  licenses  patents and trademarks  and customer relationships  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years 
sfas requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  using fair value measurement techniques 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
acquisitions which cause us to recognize goodwill and other intangible assets require us to make determinations that involve estimates and judgments about the value and recoverability of those assets 
we consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
these indicators may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
if these or other indicators are present  we determine whether the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value 
if less than their carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
the evaluation of asset impairments related to long lived assets require us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated which requires significant judgment 
actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   we began accounting for stock based awards under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  our consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
we apply the provisions of eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods and services  and use the black scholes merton option pricing model  or black scholes model  to determine the fair value of each option grant to non employees 
see the stockholders equity note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock option activity 
the following table shows information concerning all options granted during the period january  through december  number of options granted option exercise price fair value of common stock on grant date intrinsic value per share grant date grants february may july november total grants grants january april june july october december total grants grants january february april may june july october november december total grants 
table of contents under sfas r  we have used the black scholes model to estimate fair value of our stock based awards which requires various judgmental assumptions including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
if we had made different assumptions  the amount of our deferred stock based compensation  stock based compensation expense  gross margin  net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different 
we believe that we have used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions to determine the fair value of our common stock and that deferred stock based compensation and related amortization were recorded properly for accounting purposes 
if any of the assumptions used change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
restricted stock unit activity 
restricted stock unit  or rsu  activity for the year ended december  is as follows shares non vested shares subject to rsus at december  granted vested forfeitures or expirations non vested shares subject to rsus at december  these time vested rsus entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the units vest in equal annual installments over a four year period 
the weighted average grant date fair value of the rsus granted during the year ended december  was 
employee stock purchase plan activity 
on june   our stockholders approved the adoption of our employee stock purchase plan  or the purchase plan 
the purchase plan provides eligible employees the opportunity to purchase shares of volcano corporation common stock at the lower of up to of the fair market value on the first or last day of the applicable offering period  by having withheld from their salary an amount up to of their compensation  without paying brokerage fees or commissions on purchases 
our purchase plan is deemed to be compensatory  and therefore  purchase plan expense under sfas r has been included in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and volcano corporation pays for the program s administrative expenses 
no employee may purchase more than  worth of common stock calculated at the time the purchase right is granted in any calendar year  nor may purchase more than shares in any six month purchase period 
the purchase plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors and the first offering period began on september  the purchase plan provides for the purchase of up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock of the company 
commencing january   common stock reserved for under the purchase plan automatically increases by the lower of of our outstanding common stock or  shares on the first day of january of each year 
as a result  on january   the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the purchase plan increased by  shares to  shares 
during the year ended december    shares were purchased at an average per share price of 
no shares were purchased during the year ended december  the fair value of those purchase rights granted during the year ended december  and  as defined by sfas r  was and  respectively 
at december    shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the purchase plan 

table of contents fair value assumptions 
under sfas r  the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes model utilizing the following weighted average assumptions years ended december  risk free interest rate expected life years estimated volatility factor expected dividends none none none the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the implied yield available on united states treasury constant rate securities with the same or substantially equivalent remaining terms at the time of grant 
for options granted january  through december   we adopted a temporary shortcut approach as permitted by sab no 
to develop an expected life of an employee stock option 
under this approach  the expected life is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the contractual end of the option term 
for options granted after january   we estimated the expected term using our historical share option exercise experience 
estimated volatility was calculated using the historical volatility of the common stock of comparable medical device companies using weekly price observations over a period generally commensurate with the expected term of our options 
we did not exclude any period due to discrete historical events 
we use the historical volatility of similar companies due to the limited trading history of our common stock 
since the completion of our initial public offering  we have also included the weekly price observations of our common stock  weighted for the number of price observations  in our estimate of volatility 
we also evaluate  at least annually  whether circumstances have changed such that the identified entities are no longer similar to us  and remove or replace the peer company in our analysis 
we will continue to assess the appropriateness of our methodology for future periods 
we use a zero value of the expected dividend value factor since we have not declared any dividends in the past and we do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future 
the first offering period under the purchase plan commenced in september under sfas r  the fair value of each purchase option under the purchase plan is estimated at the beginning of this purchase period using the black scholes model utilizing the following weighted average assumptions years ended december  risk free interest rate n a expected life years n a estimated volatility factor n a expected dividends none none n a the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes model for purchase rights is based on the trading history of our common stock 
the expected life assumption is based on the six month term of each offering period 
the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury constant maturity securities with the same or substantially equivalent remaining term in effect at the time of grant 
we use a zero value of the expected dividend value factor for purchase rights since we have not declared any dividends in the past and we do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future 

table of contents under sfas r  we estimate forfeitures and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
our estimated forfeiture rates in the years ended december    and are based on our historical forfeiture experience 
at december   we had approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost remaining to be amortized over a weighted average term of years 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our deferred tax assets are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the realization of our deferred tax assets  which had a gross carrying value of million at december   is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
we have evaluated our deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
within the united states and selected international jurisdictions  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including our past and future performance  the market environment in which we operate  the utilization of tax attributes in the past  and the length of carryforward periods and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance in the united states and selected international jurisdictions until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable in the respective jurisdictions 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the emerging issues task force eitf issued issue no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in interest rates and the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro and yen  could adversely affect our financial results 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to the investment of our excess cash into highly liquid financial investments 
at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments consisting of highly liquid financial investments with original maturities of one year or less 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term 
table of contents available for sale investments  a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately million for these investments 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we have assessed that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from them 
foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to our european and japanese operations 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the yen  could adversely affect our financial results 
due to the wide range of scenarios involved with our foreign currency exchange risk  it is impracticable for us to quantify the effects that future fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the euro or the us dollar and the yen may have on our results of operations 
during the year ended december   of our revenues were denominated in the euro  of our operating expenses were denominated in the euro and of our operating expenses were denominated in yen 
revenues from our japanese operations are denominated in the us dollar 
in addition  revenues were positively impacted by the valuation of foreign currencies  primarily the euro  versus the us dollar  particularly during the first three quarters of fiscal during the fourth quarter of  the us dollar strengthened versus the euro 
in periods of a strengthening us dollar  our results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods could be negatively impacted 
in april  million of intercompany receivable owed to volcano corporation from volcano europe was converted into equity  resulting in a decrease in the amount of euro based receivables being marked to market  thereby reducing the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation during the year
