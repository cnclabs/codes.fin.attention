item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an airline that provides award winning customer service primarily on point to point routes at competitive fares 
our value proposition includes operating a young  fuel efficient fleet with more legroom than any other domestic airline s coach product  free in flight entertainment  pre assigned seating  unlimited snacks  and the airline industry s only customer bill of rights 
at december   we served destinations in states  puerto rico  and five countries in the caribbean and latin america  and operated over flights a day with a fleet of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft 
in  we reported a net loss of million and an operating margin of  compared to net income of million and an operating margin of in the year over year decline in our financial performance was primarily a result of a increase in our realized fuel price and a net million impairment charge related to the write down of our auction rate securities  or ars  which was mitigated in part by continued modifications to our growth plans and increased focus on revenue initiatives 
financial institutions in the us and around the world were  and continue to be  severely impacted by the ongoing credit and liquidity crisis 
the significant distress experienced by financial institutions has had  and may continue to have  far reaching adverse consequences across many industries  including the airline industry 
our disciplined growth strategy begins with managing the growth  size and age of our fleet 
in  in response to continuing high fuel prices and the uncertain economic conditions  we continued to carefully manage the size of our fleet 
we modified our airbus a purchase agreement twice  resulting in the deferral of aircraft previously scheduled for delivery between and to and we also modified our embraer purchase agreement  deferring delivery of ten embraer aircraft previously scheduled for delivery between and to we increased the size of our a operating fleet by three net aircraft during the year  through the purchase of new aircraft offset by the sale of nine of our older aircraft 
our embraer operating fleet increased by a total of five net aircraft during the year  through the acquisition of seven new aircraft offset by our leasing of two aircraft to another airline 
we sold two embraer aircraft in january we may further slow our fleet growth through additional aircraft sales  leasing of aircraft  returns of leased aircraft and or deferral of aircraft deliveries 
our growth in was achieved largely through adding more flights to existing routes and new routes between existing destinations 
additionally  we shifted some of our transcontinental capacity to other routes  primarily caribbean routes 
we added only two new destinations in  compared to the five that were added in and that were added in in  we closed our operations in nashville  tn  columbus  oh  tucson  az and ontario  ca  which allowed us to redeploy aircraft to more profitable routes 
in  we plan to continue to focus on adding service between existing destinations and rational growth in the number of new destinations  including the january addition of bogot  colombia  the march addition of san jos  costa rica  the may addition of montego bay  jamaica  and the june addition of los angeles  ca 
in january  we issued and sold approximately million shares of our common stock to deutsche lufthansa ag for approximately million  net of transaction costs 
following the consummation of this transaction  deutsche lufthansa ag owned approximately of our total outstanding shares of common stock 
in addition to providing us much needed financial flexibility  we believe that this investment by one of the most highly respected leaders and most recognized brands in the global airline industry to be an affirmation of the jetblue brand and business model 
on october   we opened our new gate terminal at jfk s terminal adjacent to this terminal is a  space parking structure and access to the airtrain via a connection bridge 
we believe that this new terminal with its modern amenities  concession offerings and passenger convenience will become as integral to our customers jetblue experience as our in flight entertainment systems 
airlines operating in the new york metropolitan area airspace faced another difficult year in as a result of being one of the worst years on record for flight delays  the dot limited the number of flights in and out of jfk during despite this effort to alleviate congestion in the nation s largest travel market  
table of contents operating conditions continued to worsen in these challenging operating conditions were especially difficult during the summer months of when ground delay programs were in effect more days than not 
we continue to work actively with the port authority of new york and new jersey  or panynj  and the federal aviation administration  or faa  to find solutions to ease this congestion 
we derive our revenue primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft 
passenger revenue accounted for of our total operating revenues for the year ended december  revenues generated from international routes  excluding puerto rico  accounted for of our total passenger revenues in revenue is recognized either when transportation is provided or after the ticket or customer credit expires 
we measure capacity in terms of available seat miles  which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown 
yield  or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile  is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by revenue passenger miles 
we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight  which produces higher revenue per available seat mile  or rasm 
our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare and  in certain markets  utilize our network to maximize connecting opportunities while continuing to provide our customers with competitive fares 
when we enter a new market  our fares are designed to stimulate demand  particularly from fare conscious leisure and business travelers who might otherwise have used alternate forms of transportation or would not have traveled at all 
in addition to our regular fare structure  we frequently offer sale fares with shorter advance purchase requirements in most of the markets we serve and match the sale fares offered by other airlines 
in  we introduced our even more legroom  or eml  seats  an optional upgrade to our product that offers seats with additional seat pitch for a modest additional fee  which has also allowed us to increase passenger revenues 
other revenue consists primarily of fees charged to customers in accordance with our published policies relating to reservation changes and baggage limitations  the marketing component of trueblue point sales  concession revenues and revenues earned by our subsidiary  livetv  llc  for the sale of  and on going services provided for  in flight entertainment systems sold to other airlines 
we maintain one of the lowest cost structures in the industry due to the young average age of our fleet  a productive workforce  and cost discipline 
in  we plan to continue our focus on cost control while improving the jetblue experience for our customers 
the largest components of our operating expenses are aircraft fuel and salaries  wages and benefits provided to our employees 
unlike most airlines  we have a non union workforce  which we believe provides us with more flexibility and allows us to be more productive  although we are subject to ongoing attempts at unionization 
the price and availability of aircraft fuel  which is our single largest operating expense  are extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors that we can neither control nor accurately predict 
sales and marketing expenses include advertising and fees paid to credit card companies 
our distribution costs tend to be lower than those of most other airlines on a per unit basis because the majority of our customers book directly through our website or our agents 
maintenance materials and repairs are expensed when incurred unless covered by a third party services contract 
because the average age of our aircraft is years  all of our aircraft require less maintenance now than they will in the future 
our maintenance costs will increase significantly  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs  as our fleet ages 
other operating expenses consist of purchased services including expenses related to fueling  ground handling  skycap  security and janitorial services  insurance  personnel expenses  cost of goods sold to other airlines by livetv  professional fees  passenger refreshments  supplies  bad debts  communication costs  gains on aircraft sales and taxes other than payroll taxes  including fuel taxes 
the airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the us  with taxes and fees accounting for approximately of the total fare charged to a customer 
airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer 
additionally  if the tsa changes the way the aviation security infrastructure fee is assessed  our security costs may be higher 
the airline industry has been intensely competitive in recent years  due in part to persistently high fuel prices and the adverse financial condition of many of the domestic airlines 
in us airways and america west merged  and each of delta air lines and northwest airlines filed for bankruptcy protection 
both delta and northwest emerged from bankruptcy in with lower costs and  in  they merged their operations  
table of contents actions which have  and will continue to allow them to compete more vigorously 
in  as a result of continued high fuel prices and challenging economic conditions  at least eight domestic airlines ceased their operations 
we are unable to predict what the effect of further industry consolidation would be for us or for the airline industry in general 
our ability to be profitable in this competitive environment depends on  among other things  operating at costs equal to or lower than those of our competitors  continuing to provide high quality customer service and maintaining adequate liquidity levels 
although we have been able to raise capital and continue to grow  the highly competitive nature of the airline industry and the impact of the current economic recession could prevent us from attaining the passenger traffic or yields required to be profitable in new and existing markets 
the highest levels of traffic and revenue on our routes to and from florida are generally realized from october through april  and on our routes to and from the western united states in the summer 
many of our areas of operations in the northeast experience bad weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with de icing aircraft  cancelled flights and accommodating displaced passengers 
our florida and caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses to our entry by other airlines 
given our high proportion of fixed costs  this seasonality may cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter 
outlook for our focus in will continue to be on rational growth  rigorous cost control and revenue optimization while managing risk in an uncertain and recessionary economic environment 
we expect the slower growth trend that we began to see in to continue through however  we will continue to reallocate capacity in order to take advantage of market opportunities  including potential further reductions in transcontinental flights and an increased caribbean presence 
in addition  we are continuously looking to expand our other revenue opportunities 
we expect our full year operating capacity for to decrease approximately to over with the addition of three new airbus a aircraft and eight new embraer aircraft to our operating fleet  offset by the planned lease return of one of our airbus a aircraft during the year and the sale of two of our embraer aircraft in january assuming fuel prices of per gallon  net of effective hedges  our cost per available seat mile for is expected to decrease by to over our operating margin is expected to be between and and our pre tax margin is expected to be between and for the full year 
we expect our corrected first quarter weighted shares outstanding to be basic and diluted with full year estimates to be basic and diluted 
results of operations the us domestic airline environment was extremely challenging throughout primarily due to high aircraft fuel prices and vigorous price competition  along with a softening demand environment attributable to deteriorating economic conditions 
however  due to the optimization of our own fare mix  average fares for the year increased over to  while load factor declined points to from the full year our on time performance  defined by the dot as arrivals within minutes of schedule  was in compared to in while we saw some improvement in our on time performance on a year over year  it continued to be affected by the fact that a significant percentage of our flights operate out of three of the most congested and delay prone airports in the us  as reflected by our and completion factors in and  respectively 
year compared to year we reported a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in in  we had operating income of million  a decrease of million over  and our operating margin was  down points from diluted loss per share was for compared to diluted earnings per share of for 
table of contents operating revenues 
operating revenues increased  or million  primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
the million increase in passenger revenues was attributable to a increase in yield due to higher average fare offset by a slightly lower load factor 
passenger revenues were also higher due to a increase in departures 
included in passenger revenues are the fees collected from passengers related to our new eml product upgrade 
other revenue increased  or million  primarily due to higher change fees and excess baggage fees of million resulting from more passengers  the introduction of the second checked bag fee in  and increased change fee rates 
other revenue also increased due to higher livetv third party revenues  rental income  mail revenues  in flight sales  and the marketing component of trueblue point sales

we estimate that more a significant portion of the year over year increase in our total cost per available seat mile was attributable to the decrease in our aircraft utilization and also was a significant factor of the increase in each component 
aircraft fuel expense increased  or million  which includes the effective portion of fuel hedging  due to a increase in average fuel cost per gallon  and nine million more gallons of aircraft fuel consumed resulting in million of additional fuel expense 
aircraft fuel prices continued to ascend to record high levels during most of  with our average fuel price per gallon at compared to for the year ended december  our fuel costs represented and of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
based on our expected fuel volume for  a 
per gallon increase in the cost of aircraft fuel would increase our annual fuel expense by approximately million 
cost per available seat mile increased primarily due to higher fuel prices 
salaries  wages and benefits increased  or million  due primarily to a increase in average full time equivalent employees and increases in pay rates  offset by a decrease in overtime pay that was incurred in connection with the weather related events in the first quarter of the increase in average full time equivalent employees is partially driven by our policy of not furloughing employees during economic downturns 
cost per available seat mile increased as a result of the increases in salaries  wages  and benefits landing fees and other rents increased  or million  due to a increase in departures over and increased airport rents associated with increased rates in existing markets as well as the opening of two new cities in cost per available seat mile increased due to the increased rents

other operating expenses include the impact of million and million in gains on sales of aircraft in and  respectively 
other operating expenses were further offset in by million for certain tax incentives 
cost per available seat mile increased due primarily to additional livetv third party customer installations and taxes associated with the increase in fuel price

interest expense was reduced by approximately million due to lower interest rates and the scheduled pay downs of our long term debt obligations and an additional million related to retired debt for sold aircraft 
interest expense also included an increased accretion in interest related to the construction obligation for our new terminal at jfk  of which million was capitalized 
this increase in capitalized interest was offset by lower balances on our pre delivery deposit facility and lower interest rates 
interest income and other decreased  or million  primarily due to a million net impairment charge for ars and a million decrease in interest income due to lower rates of return in  offset partially by million in gains on the extinguishment of debt 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in  mainly due to the establishment of a valuation allowance of million related to our million ars impairment

a shorter average stage length results in fewer available seat miles and  therefore  higher unit costs 
we estimate that more than half of the year over year increase in our total cost per available seat mile was attributable to the decrease in our average stage length and also was a significant factor of the increase in each component 
aircraft fuel expense increased  or million  due to million more gallons of aircraft fuel consumed resulting in million of additional fuel expense and a increase in average fuel cost per gallon  or million 
aircraft fuel prices remained at or near historically high levels in  with our average fuel price per gallon at compared to for the year ended december  our fuel costs represented and of our operating expenses in and  respectively

during the third and fourth quarters  we recorded an additional million and million  respectively  in interest expense related to the early conversion of a portion of our convertible debentures due additionally  in the third and fourth quarters  we recognized million and million in interest income related to the gain on extinguishment of debt  respectively 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded a net other than temporary impairment of million related to the write down in the value of our ars 
excludes results of operations and employees of livetv  llc  which are unrelated to our airline operations and are immaterial to our consolidated operating results 
although we have continued to experience significant revenue growth  this trend may not continue 
we expect our expenses to continue to increase significantly as we acquire additional aircraft  as our fleet ages and as we expand the frequency of flights in existing markets and enter into new markets 
accordingly  the comparison of the financial data for the quarterly periods presented may not be meaningful 
in addition  we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of various factors  many of which are outside our control 
consequently  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  cash flows used in operating activities totaled million in compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million in and million in the million decrease in cash flows from operations in compared to was primarily as a result of a higher price of fuel in compared to and the million in collateral we posted for margin calls related to our outstanding fuel hedge and interest rate swap contracts  offset in part by higher yields 
we also posted million in restricted cash that collateralizes letters of credit issued to certain of our business partners  including million for our primary credit card processor 
cash flows from operations in compared to increased due to the growth of our business 
we rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations 
at december   we had two lines of credit  totaling million secured by all of our ars  as well as one short term borrowing facility for certain aircraft predelivery deposits 
at december   we had a total of million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
net cash provided by investing and financing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing and financing activities of million in and million in investing activities

in june  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec relating to our sale  from time to time  in one or more public offerings of debt securities  pass through certificates  common stock  preferred stock and or other securities 
the net proceeds of any securities we sell under this registration statement may be used to fund working capital and capital expenditures  including the purchase of aircraft and construction of facilities on or near airports 
through december   we had issued a total of million of securities under this registration statement 
in april  we filed a prospectus supplement under our automatic shelf registration statement registering the shares of our common stock issued to deutsche lufthansa ag in january such shares were registered pursuant to our obligations under our registration rights agreement with deutsche lufthansa ag 
we have not received the proceeds of any shares sold by deutsche lufthansa ag 
none of our lenders or lessors are affiliated with us 
our short term borrowings consist of a floating rate facility with a group of commercial banks to finance aircraft predelivery deposits and a secured line of credit  used for general operating activities 
capital resources 
we have been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our working capital requirements 
other than two lines of credit  which are secured by ars held by us  and our short term aircraft predelivery deposit facility  substanitally all of our property and equipment is encumbered 
we typically finance our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing 
at december   we operated a fleet of aircraft  of which were financed under operating leases  four were financed under capital leases and the remaining were financed by secured debt 
financing in the form of secured debt or leases has been arranged for all three airbus a aircraft and for the six net embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery in although we believe that debt and or lease financing should be available for our remaining aircraft deliveries  we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us  if at all 
while these financings may or may not result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet  our fixed costs will increase significantly regardless of the financing method ultimately chosen 
to the extent we cannot secure financing  we may be required to modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs 
working capital 
we had a working capital deficit of million at december   which is customary for airlines since air traffic liability is classified as a current liability  compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  our working capital includes the fair value of our fuel hedge 
table of contents derivatives  which was a liability of million at december  and an asset of million at december  we reduced our december  liability associated with these instruments by posting million in cash collateral with our counterparties 
also contributing to our working capital deficit is the classification of our million of ars as long term assets at december  at december   we had million invested in ars  which were included in short term investments 
beginning in february  all of the ars then held by us experienced failed auctions which resulted in us continuing to hold these securities beyond the initial auction reset periods 
with auctions continuing to fail through the end of  we have classified all of our ars as long term  since maturities of the underlying debt securities range from to years 
although the auctions for the securities have failed  we have not experienced any defaults and continue to earn and receive interest on all of these investments at the maximum contractual rate 
as a result of the illiquidity in the market following the auction failures  we have recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million through earnings related to the ars we hold  bringing the carrying value at december  to million 
all of our ars are collateralized by student loan portfolios substantially all of which are guaranteed by the united states government  million par value of which had a aaa rating and the remainder of which had an a rating 
despite the quality of the underlying collateral  the market for ars and other securities has been diminished due to the lack of liquidity experienced in the market throughout and expected to be experienced into the future 
we continue to monitor the market for our ars and any change in their fair values will be reflected in other income expense in future periods 
during  various regulatory agencies began investigating the sales and marketing activities of the banks and broker dealers that sold ars  alleging violations of federal and state laws in connection with these activities 
one of the two broker dealers from which we purchased ars has since announced settlements under which they will repurchase the ars at par at a future date 
as a result of our participation in this settlement agreement  ubs is required to repurchase our ars brokered by them beginning june  we have participated in this settlement agreement and accordingly have a separate put agreement asset recorded at fair value of million on our consolidated balance sheet at december  we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash  investment securities and internally generated funds  supplemented as necessary by debt and or equity financings and proceeds from aircraft sale and leaseback transactions 
we have recently sold two embraer aircraft in january and may further reduce our obligations through additional aircraft sales and or return of leased aircraft  however  our ability to do so is dependent on factors outside of our control  including the ability of the prospective purchasers to obtain third party financing 
we expect to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as the extreme volatility in fuel prices  the current economic recession and global credit and liquidity crisis  weather related disruptions  the impact of airline bankruptcies or consolidations  us military actions or acts of terrorism 
assuming that we utilize the predelivery short term borrowing facility available to us  as well as our two lines of credit  we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
contractual obligations our noncancelable contractual obligations at december  include in millions payments due in total thereafter long term debt and capital lease obligations lease commitments flight equipment obligations short term borrowings financing obligations and other total includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on december  rates 

table of contents amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services 
the interest rates are fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates adjust quarterly or semi annually based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
the weighted average maturity of all of our debt was nine years at december  we are not subject to any financial covenants in any of our debt obligations  except for the requirement to maintain million in cash and cash equivalents related to our million line of credit agreement entered into in july our spare parts pass through certificates issued in november require us to maintain certain non financial collateral coverage ratios  which could require us to provide additional spare parts collateral or redeem some or all of the related equipment notes 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our debt and lease agreements and of our owned property and equipment was collateralized 
we have operating lease obligations for aircraft with lease terms that expire from to five of these leases have variable rate rent payments that adjust semi annually based on libor 
we also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets  as well as office space and other equipment 
we have million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases which will expire at the end of the related lease terms 
including the effects of the amendments to our airbus and embraer purchase agreements  our firm aircraft orders at december  consisted of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery as follows in  in  in  in  in  in  in  and in we meet our predelivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short term borrowing facilities for deposits required six to months prior to delivery 
any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft 
we also have options to acquire additional airbus a aircraft for delivery from through and additional embraer aircraft for delivery from through we can elect to substitute airbus a aircraft or a aircraft for the a aircraft until months prior to the scheduled delivery date for those aircraft not on firm order 
in october  we began operating out of our new terminal at jfk  or terminal  which we had been constructing since november the construction and operation of this facility is governed by a lease agreement that we entered into with the panynj in we are responsible for making various payments under the lease  including ground rents for the new terminal site which began on lease execution in and facility rents that commenced in october upon our occupancy of the new terminal 
the facility rents are based on the number of passengers enplaned out of the new terminal  subject to annual minimums 
the panynj has reimbursed us for costs of this project in accordance with the terms of the lease  except for approximately million in leasehold improvements that have been provided by us 
for financial reporting purposes  this project is being accounted for as a financing obligation  with the constructed asset and related liability being reflected on our balance sheets 
minimum ground and facility rents for this terminal totaling billion are included in the commitments table above as lease commitments and financing obligations 
anticipated capital expenditures for facility improvements  spare parts and ground purchases in are projected to be approximately million 
our commitments also include those of livetv  which has several noncancelable long term purchase agreements with its suppliers to provide equipment to be installed on its customers aircraft  including jetblue s aircraft 
we enter into individual employment agreements with each of our faa licensed employees 
each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five year term unless either the employee or we elect not to renew it 
pursuant to these agreements  these employees can only be terminated for cause 
in the event of a downturn in our business that would require a reduction in work hours  we are obligated to pay these employees a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits 
as we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits  no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the table above 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our balance sheet 
although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are variable interest entities  as defined by fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  none of them require consolidation in our financial statements 
the decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each option and a consideration of our liquidity requirements 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with operating these aircraft  however  we have not made any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors 
we have determined that we hold a variable interest in  but are not the primary beneficiary of  certain pass through trusts which are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of new aircraft and certain aircraft spare parts owned by jetblue and held by such pass through trusts 
these pass through trusts maintain liquidity facilities whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs 
the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates and the spare parts certificates are landesbank hessen th ringen girozentrale and morgan stanley capital services inc the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates are landesbank baden w rttemberg and citibank  na we utilize a policy provider to provide credit support on our class g and class g floating rate enhanced equipment notes 
the policy provider has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of interest on the certificates when due and the payment of principal on the certificates no later than months after the final expected regular distribution date 
the policy provider is mbia insurance corporation a subsidiary of mbia  inc 
financial information for the parent company of the policy provider is available at the sec s website at http www 
sec 
gov or at the sec s public reference room in washington  dc we have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our balance sheet  which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies  including guarantees and indemnities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates that are required to prepare our financials statements 
we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
in addition  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
passenger revenue 
passenger ticket sales are initially deferred in air traffic liability 
the air traffic liability also includes customer credits issued and unused tickets whose travel date has passed 
credit for unused tickets and customer credits can each be applied towards another ticket within months of the original scheduled service or months from the issuance of the customer credit 
revenue is recognized when transportation is provided or when a ticket or customer credit expires 
we also defer in the air traffic liability  an estimate for customer credits issued in conjunction with the jetblue airways customer bill of rights that are expected to be ultimately redeemed 
these estimates are based on historical experience and are periodically evaluated  and adjusted if necessary  based on actual credit usage 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
in estimating useful lives and 
table of contents residual values of our aircraft  we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
the amortization of our purchased technology  which resulted from our acquisition of livetv in  is based on the average number of aircraft in service and expected to be in service as of the date of their acquisition 
this method results in an increasing annual expense through when the last of these aircraft are expected to be placed into service and is adjusted to reflect changes in our contractual delivery schedule 
our long lived assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in technology 
as our assets are all relatively new and we continue to have positive cash flow  we have not identified any significant impairments related to our long lived assets at this time 
stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas r in required the recording of stock based compensation expense for issuances under our stock purchase plan and stock incentive plan over their requisite service period using a fair value approach similar to the pro forma disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards under sfas r  which is the same valuation technique we previously used for pro forma disclosures under sfas the black scholes merton option pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions 
we estimate the expected term of options granted using an implied life derived from the results of a lattice model  which incorporates our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
the expected term of restricted stock units is based on the requisite service period of the awards being granted 
the expected term for our employee stock purchase plan valuation is based on the length of each purchase period as measured at the beginning of the offering period 
we estimate the expected volatility of our common stock at the grant date using a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of two year publicly traded options on our common stock as of the option grant date 
our decision to use a blend of historical and implied volatility was based upon the volume of actively traded options on our common stock and our belief that historical volatility alone may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
regardless of the method selected  significant judgment is required for some of the valuation variables 
the most significant of these is the volatility of our common stock and the estimated term over which our stock options will be outstanding 
the valuation calculation is sensitive to even slight changes in these estimates 
lease accounting 
we operate airport facilities  offices buildings and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments associated with these agreements recognized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
within the provisions of certain leases there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term  which includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing 
the amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight line rent expense or their estimated economic life  whichever is shorter 
had different conclusions been reached with respect to the lease term and related renewal periods  different amounts of amortization and rent expense would have been reported 
derivative instruments used for aircraft fuel 
we utilize financial derivative instruments to manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative instrument for trading purposes 
at december   we had a million liability related to the net fair value of our derivative instruments 
the majority of our financial derivative instruments are not traded on a public exchange 
fair values are assigned based on commodity prices that are provided to us by independent third parties 
when possible  we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement 
sfas is a complex accounting standard  requiring that we develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to our fuel hedging program and strategy  statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the 
table of contents risk being hedged ie aircraft fuel on both a historical and prospective basis and cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed  to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction 
this documentation requires that we estimate forward aircraft fuel prices since there is no reliable forward market for aircraft fuel 
these prices are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices  such as crude oil and or heating oil  and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities 
historically  our hedges have settled within months  therefore  the deferred gains and losses have been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time 
fair value measurements 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements  on january  sfas clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
sfas also requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped  based on significant levels of inputs 
we rely on unobservable level inputs  which are highly subjective  in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities including ars and our interest rate swaps 
ars are long term debt securities for which interest rates reset regularly at pre determined intervals  typically days  through an auction process 
we held ars  with a total par value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
beginning in february  all of the ars held by us experienced failed auctions which resulted in our continuing to hold these securities beyond the initial auction reset periods 
with auctions continuing to fail through the end of  we have classified all of our ars as long term  since maturities of underlying debt securities range from to years 
although the auctions for the securities have failed  million have been redeemed by their issuers at par  we have not experienced any defaults and continue to earn and receive interest on all of these investments at the maximum contractual rate 
at december   these securities were valued based on the markets in which they were trading  a level input  which equaled their par value 
the estimated fair value of these securities at december   however  no longer approximated par value and was estimated through discounted cash flows  a level input 
our discounted cash flow analysis considered  among other things  the quality of the underlying collateral  the credit rating of the issuers  an estimate of when these securities are either expected to have a successful auction or otherwise return to par value and expected interest income to be received over this period  which was estimated to be an average of eight years 
because of the inherent subjectivity in valuing these securities  we also considered independent valuations obtained for each of our ars held as of december  in estimating their fair values 
all of our ars are collateralized by student loan portfolios substantially all of which are guaranteed by the united states government  million of which had a aaa rating and the remainder had an a rating 
despite the quality of the underlying collateral  the market for ars and other securities has been diminished due to the lack of liquidity experienced in the market throughout and expected to be experienced into the future 
through september   we had experienced a million decline in fair value  which we had classified as temporary and reflected as an unrealized loss in other comprehensive income 
through the fourth quarter  however  the lack of liquidity in the capital markets not only continued  but deteriorated further  resulting in the decline in fair value totaling million at december  this decline in fair value was also deemed to be other than temporary due to the continued auction failures and expected lack of liquidity in the capital markets into the foreseeable future  which resulted in an impairment charge being recorded in other income expense 
we continue to monitor the market for our ars and any change in their fair values will be reflected in other income expense in future periods 
we have elected to apply the fair value option under statement of financial accounting standard  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  to an agreement with one of our ars broker  to repurchase  at par 
we recorded a million gain associated with fair value of this put option  which offsets million of related ars impairment included in other income expense 
the fair value of the put is determined by comparing the fair value of the related ars  as described above  to their par values and also considers the credit risk associated with the broker 
this put option will be adjusted on each balance sheet date based on its then fair value 
the fair value of the put option is based on unobservable inputs and is therefore classified as level in the hierarchy 

table of contents in february  we entered into interest rate swaps  which qualify as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas the fair values of our interest rate swaps were initially based on inputs received from the counterparty 
these values were corroborated by adjusting the active swap indications in quoted markets for similar terms years for the specific terms within our swap agreements 
there was no ineffectiveness relating to these interest rate swaps in  with all of the unrealized losses being deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income 
frequent flyer accounting 
we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for our trueblue customer loyalty program  which are consistent with industry practices 
we record a liability  which was million as of december   for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards  including an estimate for partially earned awards 
the estimated cost includes incremental fuel  insurance  passenger food and supplies  and reservation costs 
in estimating the liability  we currently assume that of earned awards will be redeemed and that of our outstanding points will ultimately result in awards 
periodically  we evaluate our assumptions for appropriateness  including comparison of the cost estimates to actual costs incurred as well as the expiration and redemption assumptions to actual experience 
changes in the minimum award levels or in the lives of the awards would also require us to reevaluate the liability  potentially resulting in a significant impact in the year of change as well as in future years 
we also sell trueblue points to participating partners 
revenue from these sales is allocated between passenger revenues and other revenues 
the amount attributable to passenger revenue is determined based on the fair value of transportation expected to be provided when awards are redeemed and is recognized when travel is provided 
total sales proceeds in excess of the estimated transportation fair value is recognized at the time of sale 
deferred revenue was million at december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes to the price of fuel and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
variable rate leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
actual results may differ 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
our results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
to manage the price risk  we use crude or heating oil option contracts or swap agreements 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel 
based on projected fuel consumption  such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  as of december   we had hedged approximately of our projected fuel requirements 
all hedge contracts existing at december  settle by the end of we expect to realize approximately million in losses during which was deferred in other comprehensive income as of december  related to our outstanding fuel hedge swaps 
interest 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
the interest rate is fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
if interest rates average higher in than they did during  our interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  if interest rates average lower in than they did during  our interest income from cash and investment balances would decrease by approximately million  compared to million for measured as of december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt  cash equivalents and investment securities balances at december  and fixed rate debt 
on december   our million aggregate principal amount of convertible debt had a total estimated fair value of million  based on quoted market prices 
if interest rates were higher than the stated rate  the fair value of this debt would have been million as of december
