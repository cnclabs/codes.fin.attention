overview we provide scientific services  technologies and products focused on improving the quality of life while delivering excellence  value and maximum return to our shareholders 
our core business consists of contract drug discovery  development and manufacturing services 
in addition to our contract services  we also have a separate  strategic technology division consisting of proprietary technology investments  internal drug discovery and niche generic active pharmaceutical ingredient product development 
we conduct proprietary research and development to discover new therapeutically active lead compounds with commercial potential 
we anticipate that we would then license these compounds to third parties in return for up front and service fees  and milestone payments as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are developed into new commercial drugs 
our proprietary research and development activities previously led us to license the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize potential products from the amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor patents and technology identified in one of our proprietary research programs to bristol myers squibb company bms  in october in addition  these activities also led to the development  patenting and licensing of a substantially pure form of  and a manufacturing process for  the active ingredient in the non sedating antihistamine fexofenadine hcl marketed by sanofi aventis sa as allegra in the americas and as telfast elsewhere 
our total revenue for was million  including million from our contract service business  from milestones and million from royalties on sales of allegra telfast 
we generated million in cash from operations and used million in capital expenditures on our facilities and equipment  primarily related to the expansion of our research facilities in singapore  the expansion and modernization of our large scale facilities in india and modernization of our large scale manufacturing facilities in the us in addition  we used million on the repurchase of common stock 
we recorded net income of million in as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million in bank and other related debt  carrying a blended interest rate of approximately 
strategy we provide contract services to the world s leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we derive our contract revenue from research and development expenditures and commercial manufacturing demands of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry 
we continue to execute our long term strategy to develop and grow an integrated global platform from which we can provide these services 
we have research and manufacturing facilities in the united states  hungary  singapore and india 
we purchased an additional large scale manufacturing site in india in january and completed a  square foot expansion of our singapore research center in we continue to integrate our research and manufacturing facilities worldwide  increasing our access to key global markets and enabling us to provide our customers with a flexible combination of high quality services and competitive cost structures to meet their individual outsourcing needs 
we seek comprehensive research and or supply agreements with our customers  incorporating several of our service offerings and spanning across the entire pharmaceutical research and development process 
our research facilities provide discovery  chemical development  analytical  and small scale current good manufacturing practices cgmp manufacturing services 
compounds discovered and or developed in our research facilities can then be more easily transitioned to production at our large scale manufacturing facilities for use in clinical trials and  ultimately  commercial sales if the product meets regulatory approval 
we believe that the ability to partner with a single provider of pharmaceutical research and development services from discovery through commercial production is of significant benefit to our customers 
through our comprehensive service offerings  we are able to provide customers with a more efficient transition of experimental compounds through the research and development process  ultimately reducing the time and cost involved in bringing these compounds from concept to market 
our global platform has increased our market share and was developed in order to allow us to maintain and grow margins 
in addition to our globalization  we continue to implement process efficiencies  including our implementation of a process improvement and cost savings campaign lean to excellence  along with efforts to strengthen our sourcing 
we believe these factors will lead to improved margins 
we conduct proprietary research and development to discover new therapeutically active lead compounds with commercial potential 
we anticipate that we would then license these compounds and underlying technology to third parties in return for up front and service fees and milestone payments  as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are developed into new commercial drugs 
research and development is performed at our large scale manufacturing facility related to the potential manufacture of new products  the development of processes for the manufacture of generic products with commercial potential  and the development of alternative manufacturing processes 
in recent years  we have experienced increased demand in the areas of developmental and small scale cgmp manufacturing services  reflecting a reduction in budgetary constraints of our emerging pharmaceutical and biotech customers and their increased efforts to bring identified compounds into clinical trials 
during this timeframe  partly in recognition of increased competition and consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry  we established lower cost international operations in hungary  singapore and india 
contract service providers that were not able to offer a cost competitive product were forced to exit or significantly reduce their presence in the marketplace during this time 
in addition to providing customers with a range of technologies and cost options  expanding internationally has provided increased access to customers and potential customers in regions of the world which we have  until recently  not significantly pursued 
in addition to the longer term trend of growth in development and small scale cgmp manufacturing services discussed above  we have more recently seen an increased trend in demand for our discovery services 
this demand increases as our ability to provide high quality services under a variety of business models and cost structures by incorporating our international facilities has been well received by our customers 
we currently expect a decrease in customer delivery patterns and demand caused by the economic downturn to affect us in the beginning of we anticipate a future return to the increased demand trend and expect the majority of our growth to occur in the latter part of we continue to build on our strategy of leveraging our global resources to meet changing and expanding global outsourcing needs and additionally to expand our global service platform to meet the needs of our customers 
in  we completed the construction of a  square foot research center focusing primarily on custom synthesis and medicinal chemistry support services at the shapoorji pallonji biotech park in hyderabad  india 
in  we completed a  square foot expansion of our singapore research center 
in addition to increasing existing discovery service capabilities  the expansion of our singapore research center will also include the introduction of in vitro biology services at the facility 
we also commenced the expansion of our research facilities in budapest  hungary and bothell  washington during results of operations operating segment data we have organized our sales  marketing and production activities into the discovery development small scale manufacturing dds and large scale manufacturing lsm segments based on the criteria set forth in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we rely on an internal management accounting system to report results of these segments 
the accounting system includes revenue and cost information by segment 
we make financial decisions and allocate resources based on the information we receive from this internal system 
the dds segment includes activities such as drug lead discovery  optimization  drug development and small scale commercial manufacturing 
the lsm segment includes pilot to commercial scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates and high potency and controlled substance manufacturing 
api manufacturing is performed at our rensselaer facility and is in compliance with cgmp 
contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers 
our contract revenues for our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in thousands dds lsm total dds contract revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to contract revenue of million for the same period in this increase is primarily due to an increase in discovery services revenue which increased million 
this increase is due to increased demand for these services  as our ability to offer various combinations of services and cost structures at our us and international locations continues to gain acceptance in the worldwide marketplace  and approximately million due to the completion of the preliminary screening phase of an on going natural products collaboration project at our bothell research facility 
the year over year increase is also due to increased contract revenue from development and small scale manufacturing services of million  as customers continued to focus on development stage projects 
we currently expect discovery services and development and small scale manufacturing services revenue to remain consistent with or decrease slightly from amounts recognized in the flat growth year over year will be due to completing the recognition of access fees related to the preliminary screening phase of an on going natural products collaboration noted above  as well as the completion of the funded research component of our on going collaboration with bms and lower demand from specialty biotech and soft pricing in the overall current economic downturn 
lsm contract revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in the increase in contract revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in incremental revenues from our june amri india acquisition 
additionally  sales to ge healthcare increased million due to the timing of customer requirements and related deliveries  along with an increase in revenue from the production of clinical supply materials for use in advanced stage human trials of commercial product of million 
we expect full year lsm contract revenue in to increase from amounts recognized in due to increased us commercial demand for new commercial and near commercial products 
dds contract revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to contract revenue of million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to an increase in contract revenue from development and small scale manufacturing services of million  as customers continued to focus on development stage projects 
in addition  discovery services revenue increased million due to increased demand for these services  as our ability to offer various combinations of services and cost structures at our us and international locations continued to gain acceptance in the worldwide marketplace 
lsm contract revenue decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in the decrease in contract revenue was primarily attributable to the decrease in sales to ge healthcare of million due to the timing of customer requirements  along with a decrease in revenue from the production of clinical supply materials for use in advanced stage human trials of million 
these decreases were offset  in part  by an increase in incremental revenues from our june amri india acquisition  coupled with commercial sales of million 
recurring royalties we earn royalties under our licensing agreement with sanofi aventis sa for the active ingredient fexofenadine hcl  marketed as allegra in the americas and telfast elsewhere 
royalties were as follows year ended december  in thousands recurring royalties  which are based on the worldwide sales of allegra telfast  as well as on sales of sanofi aventis authorized generics  increased million for the year ended december  from the same period in recurring royalties  which are based on the worldwide sales of fexofenadine hcl  marketed as allegra in the americas and telfast elsewhere  as well as on the sales of sanofi aventis authorized generics  slightly increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues  earnings  and operating cash flows 
during and  we experienced a decrease in revenues  earnings  and operating cash flows from historical levels due to the impact of the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine by barr pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
on us sales of allegra by sanofi aventis 
we currently expect full year royalty revenues for to increase from amounts recognized in which will be driven by the new royalty stream we will be earning on teva s sales of fexofenadine as well as the amortization of the sub license fee we received from sanofi aventis 
while the settlement affords the option for a launch of a generic version of allegra d in november  the company will receive quarterly royalties through july equal to the royalties paid for the quarter ended june  we continue to develop our business in an effort to supplement the revenues  earnings and operating cash flows that have historically been provided by allegra telfast royalties 
we forcefully and vigorously defend our intellectual property related to allegra  and we continue to pursue our intellectual property rights as patent infringement litigation progresses 
milestone revenue milestone revenue is earned for achieving certain milestones included in licensing and research agreements with certain customers 
milestone revenues were as follows year ended december  in thousands during the year ended december   the company recognized million of milestone revenue in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms 
a million milestone payment was triggered by bms s submission of an application to the health products and food branch hpfb  health canada to initiate phase clinical studies on a compound 
an additional million was recognized for advancing a second compound into pre clinical development under the same agreement with bms 
milestone revenue received during the year ended december  is primarily due to a milestone payment of million in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms 
this milestone payment was triggered by a compound being developed under the agreement proceeding into pre clinical development 
an additional million of milestone revenue was recognized during the fourth quarter of from a collaborative research agreement 
cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees  as well as chemicals  depreciation and other indirect project related costs 
cost of contract revenue for our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in thousands dds lsm total dds gross margin lsm gross margin total gross margin dds contract revenue gross margin was for the year ended december   compared to in the increase in gross margin resulted from an increase in contract revenues in relation to the fixed cost components of dds contract business 
we expect dds contract revenue gross margins to remain flat or decrease in due to lower demand for these services in relation to our fixed costs  as well as the completion of the recognition of revenue and access fees associated with preliminary screening phase of an on going natural products collaboration project at our bothell research facility and the funded research component of our on going collaboration with bms 
lsm contract revenue gross margin increased to for the year ended december  compared to in the increase is primarily due to process efficiencies as well as an increase in sales volume from our largest customer  ge healthcare 
these increases were partially offset  by a decrease in margin resulting from start up costs associated with our acquisitions of amri india and finekem  along with price concessions on sales to ge healthcare in although these price concessions decreased our gross margin  we believed this would strengthen our ability to retain this customer beyond the contract period ending in this result was achieved in january when ge healthcare extended its supply agreement with us to continue through we expect gross margins in the lsm segment to improve in  from increased revenue and greater capacity utilization of the facilities for near commercial and new commercial products 
this improvement will be offset  in part  by a decrease in margins in relation to further price concessions to ge healthcare 
dds contract revenue gross margin was for the year ended december   compared to in the decrease in gross margin largely resulted from underutilized capacity at some of our international locations  offset in part  by an increase in contract revenues in relation to the fixed cost components of dds contract business 
lsm contract revenue gross margin increased to for the year ended december  compared to in the increase is primarily due to process efficiencies as well as the recognition of operating cost savings resulting from the november restructuring of this segment 
this increase was offset  in part  by a decrease in margin resulting from start up costs associated with our acquisition of amri india 
technology incentive award we maintain a technology development incentive plan  the purpose of which is to stimulate and encourage novel innovative technology development by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor or made a significant intellectual contribution 
to date  the royalties from allegra are the main driver of the awards 
accordingly  as the creator of the technology  the award is currently payable primarily to dr 
thomas d ambra  the chief executive officer and president of the company 
the incentive awards were as follows year ended december  in thousands the increase in technology incentive award expense for the year ended december  as compared to is due to the increase in allegra royalty revenue and an increase in awards granted in relation to milestone payments 
we expect technology incentive award expense to generally fluctuate directionally and proportionately with fluctuations in allegra royalties in future periods 
the technology incentive award expense remained flat for the year ended december  compared to the majority of expense in both years is primarily due to the incentive paid on allegra royalty revenue 
additionally in  the company recorded expense for incentives paid to employees involved in the development of our proprietary amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors resulting from the licensing of this technology to bms  while in recorded expense related to awards granted in relation to a milestone payment from bms for the same project 
research and development research and development r d expense consists of compensation and benefits for scientific personnel for work performed on proprietary technology r d projects  costs of chemicals and other out of pocket costs  and overhead costs 
we utilize our expertise in small molecule chemistry  biocatalysis and natural product technologies to perform our internal r d projects 
the goal of these programs is to discover new compounds with commercial potential 
we would then seek to license these compounds to a third party in return for a combination of up front license fees  milestone payments and recurring royalty payments if these compounds are successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
in addition  research and development is performed at our large scale manufacturing facility related to the potential manufacture of new products  the development of processes for the manufacture of generic products with commercial potential  and the development of alternative manufacturing processes 
research and development expenses were as follows year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in r d expense during the year ended december  is due primarily to the increase in third party costs associated with our oncology research program and to the establishment of r d activities at our singapore facility  offset in part by a decrease in salaries and benefits caused by the increased utilization of staff on external customer projects 
we currently expect r d expense to increase in as we continue to advance our oncology compound through phase i clinical trials 
additionally  we expect increased costs associated with the selection and advancement of two pre clinical candidates from our existing programs 
projecting completion dates and anticipated revenue from our internal research programs is not practical at this time due to the early stages of the projects and the inherent risks related to the development of new drugs 
our proprietary amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor program  which was our most advanced project at that time  was licensed to bms in october in exchange for up front license fees  contracted research services  and the rights to future milestone and royalty payments 
we also continue to utilize our proprietary technologies to further advance other early to middle stage internal research programs in the fields of oncology  irritable bowel syndrome  obesity  and cns  with a view to seeking a licensing partner for these programs at an appropriate research or developmental stage 
we budget and monitor our research and development expenses by type or category  rather than by project on a comprehensive or fully allocated basis 
in addition  our r d expenses are not tracked by project as it benefits multiple projects of our technology platform 
consequently  fully loaded r d expense summaries by project are not available 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in r d expense during the year ended december  is due primarily to the progression of one of our compounds from our proprietary oncology research program to the advanced preclinical testing phase 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for marketing  operational and administrative employees  professional service fees  marketing costs and costs related to facilities and information services 
selling  general and administrative expenses were as follows year ended december  in thousands the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to incremental administrative costs at our amri india location  which was acquired in june  along with an increase in bad debt expense and increases in salaries and benefits and relocation expenses related to an increase in business development  administrative and information technology personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase slightly in primarily due to the incremental costs associated with investments in business development and information technology personnel and resources that were made throughout the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense related to the addition of business development personnel worldwide  the addition of incremental administrative costs incurred at amri india and the addition of administrative support staff at our singapore and hyderabad  india locations 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in data processing costs associated with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning erp system 
restructuring charges amri hungary in may  we initiated a restructuring of our hungary location 
the goal of the restructuring was to realign the business model for these operations to better support the company s long term strategy for providing discovery services in the european marketplace 
the company has estimated that total amri hungary operating costs will be reduced by million annually as a result of this restructuring  primarily from a reduction of workforce 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the second quarter of  including termination benefits and personnel realignment costs of approximately million  losses on grant contracts of approximately million  lease abandonment charges of approximately million and administrative costs associated with the restructuring plan of million 
the hungary restructuring activity was recorded in the dds operating segment 
the restructuring costs are included under the caption restructuring in the consolidated statement of operations during and the remaining restructuring liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet at december  the following table displays amri hungary s restructuring activity and liability balances within our dds operating segment in thousands balance at january  charges incurred amounts foreign currency translation adjustments balance at december  termination benefits and personnel realignment losses on grant contracts lease abandonment charges administrative costs associated with restructuring total termination benefits and personnel realignment costs relate to severance packages  outplacement services  and career counseling for employees affected by this restructuring 
losses on grant contracts represent estimated contractual losses that will be incurred in performing grant based work under hungary s legacy business model 
lease abandonment charges relate to costs associated with exiting the current facility 
the net cash outflow related to the hungary restructuring for the year ended december  was anticipated cash outflow related to the hungary restructuring for is approximately million  which primarily consists of the payment of termination benefits and personnel realignment and incurring losses on grant contracts 
large scale manufacturing facility on november   we announced plans to initiate a restructuring of our lsm business segment 
consistent with our continued strategy of realigning the lsm segment toward a greater focus on manufacturing clinical trial materials with strong commercial potential  the goals of the restructuring plan were to strengthen our competitiveness in this area and reduce operating costs by eliminating overlap in business processes  organization and project process flow  as well as leveraging existing resources and assets 
the restructuring plan included a reduction of workforce  as well as reductions of non essential operating expenses  raw material costs and future capital expenditure activities 
we estimated that total large scale costs were reduced by million annually as a result of this restructuring 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  including a non cash asset disposal charge of approximately million  and other charges of approximately million consisting primarily of termination benefits 
we recorded additional restructuring charges of million during the first quarter of  consisting of additional termination benefits associated with the restructuring 
there were no additional large scale restructuring charges taken during interest income  net year ended december  in thousands interest expense interest income interest income  net interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates in interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was primarily due to the reduction of outstanding interest bearing debt balances in interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to decreases in the average balances of interest bearing cash and investments held by the company as well as decreases in the interest rates earned on these balances in interest income remained constant at million for the year ended december  as compared to as increases in the average balances of interest bearing cash and investments held by the company were offset by decreases in the interest rates earned on these balances in income tax expense year ended december  in thousands income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the company s effective tax rate decreased to of pre tax income for the year ended december  from of pre tax income for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense is due primarily to an increase in pre tax income of million and changes in the composition of taxable income in relation to the applicable tax rates at our various international locations in these increases are partially offset by the recapture of tax credits derived from certain of the company s r d expenses and the reversal of reserves for an uncertain tax position  which was resolved in we expect the effective tax rate to approximate of pre tax income for income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december   due primarily to an increase in pre tax income of million 
the company s effective tax rate increased to of pre tax income for the year ended december  from of pre tax income for the year ended december  the increase is due to an increase in pre tax income in relation to the company s deductible items and non taxable earnings  which remained consistent in  along with changes in the composition of taxable income in relation to the applicable tax rates at our various international locations 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our business through operating cash flows  proceeds from borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
during  we generated cash of million from operating activities 
the primary sources of operating cash flows are increased contract and milestone revenues in along with an increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments  offset by increases in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash collections and additionally by increases in inventory purchases 
the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our operating cash flows 
as discussed in item of this form k  several generic manufacturers had filed anda applications with the fda seeking authorization to produce and market a generic version of allegra 
we and aventis pharmaceuticals have filed several patent infringement suits against these generic companies alleging infringement of certain us patents 
on november   the company  its former subsidiary amr technology  aventis pharmaceuticals  sanofi aventis  teva pharmaceuticals  and barr laboratories reached a settlement regarding the above described patent infringement litigations relating to teva pharmaceuticals and barr laboratories 
as part of the settlement  the company entered into an amendment to its licensing agreement with sanofi aventis to allow sanofi aventis to sublicense patents related to allegra and allegra d to teva pharmaceuticals and barr laboratories in the united states 
the company received an upfront sublicense fee from sanofi aventis of million  and sanofi aventis will pay royalties to the company on the sale of products in the united states containing fexofenadine hydrochloride the generic name for the active ingredient in allegra and products containing fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride generic allegra d by teva pharmaceuticals and barr laboratories through  along with additional consideration 
while the settlement affords the option for a launch of a generic version of allegra d in november  we will receive quarterly royalties through july equal to the royalties paid for the quarter ended june  thereafter  the royalty rate will revert to the rate in effect prior to the signing of the sub license amendment 
during  we generated million in cash for investing activities  primarily consisting of million for the acquisition of property and equipment and million related to the acquisition of finekem  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities  net of purchases of these securities  of million 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting primarily of million for the purchase of treasury stock  offset  in part  by million provided by proceeds from the sale of common stock  stock option exercises and stock purchase plan withholdings 
as of december   we have repurchased a total of million shares of common stock of our company at a total cost of million 
working capital was million as of december   compared to million at december  the primary reasons for the increase were increases in contract and milestone revenue and the refinancing of current debt into a long term line of credit 
these increases were partially offset by the use of cash and investments to fund treasury share repurchases  capital expenditures and the acquisition of finekem 
we believe we have mitigated a potentially significant risk associated with auction rate securities  which are included in investment securities  available for sale  on our consolidated balance sheet  by reducing our balance of these types of securities from million at december  to million at december  total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to the expansion of our research facilities in singapore  the expansion and modernization of our large scale facilities in india and modernization of our large scale manufacturing facilities in the us for  we expect to incur million in capital expenditures  primarily related to the expansion of our facilities in bothell  washington and budapest  hungary  as well as the initiation of our gmp compliant manufacturing facility in india 
during  we entered into a credit facility consisting of a million term loan and a million line of credit to fund the acquisition of amri rensselaer  inc amri rensselaer formerly known as organichem 
the term loan matured in february in june  we refinanced this loan  which included converting the balance of the term loan into a revolving line of credit  increasing the amount available under the line of credit to million  and extending the maturity date on the line of credit to june the line of credit bears interest at a variable rate based on the company s leverage ratio 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the line of credit was million  bearing interest at a rate of 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum required operating cash flow coverage ratio  a minimum earnings before interest and taxes to interest ratio and a minimum current ratio 
other covenants include limits on asset disposals and the payment of dividends 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
working capital was million as of december   compared to million at december  the primary reasons for the decrease were the use of cash and investments to fund capital expenditures  the acquisition of amri india and the maturity of a portion of the company s long term debt 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue due primarily to the recognition of deferred up front licensing fees received in conjunction with our licensing and research agreement with bms 
total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to the construction of our research facilities in singapore and hyderabad  india and modernization of our large scale manufacturing facilities 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities  primarily consisting of million for the acquisition of property and equipment and million related to the acquisition of amri india  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities  net of purchases of these securities  of million 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting primarily of million in long term debt repayments  offset  in part  by million provided by proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchase plan withholdings 
we continue to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect that such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and or the issuance of debt or equity securities and borrowings 
future acquisitions  if any  could be funded with cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing techniques that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  equity investments  unbilled revenue  income taxes  pension and postretirement benefit plans  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
contract revenue recognition our contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers and reimbursed expenses under such contracts 
we also seek to include provisions in certain contracts that contain a combination of up front licensing fees  milestone and royalty payments should our proprietary technology and expertise lead to the discovery of new products that reach the market 
reimbursed expenses consist of chemicals and other project specific costs 
generally  our contracts may be terminated by the customer upon days to one year s prior notice  depending on the size of the contract 
we analyze our agreements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and sab  revenue recognition 
allocation of revenue to individual elements which qualify for separate accounting is based on the estimated fair value of the respective elements 
we generate contract revenue on the following basis full time equivalent fte 
an fte agreement establishes the number of our employees contracted for a project or a series of projects  the duration of the contract period  the price per fte  plus an allowance for chemicals and other project specific costs  which may or may not be incorporated in the fte rate 
fte contracts can run in one month increments  but typically have terms of six months or longer 
our fte contracts typically provide for annual adjustments in billing rates for the scientists assigned to the contract 
these contracts involve our scientists providing services on a best efforts basis in a project that involves a research component with a timeframe or outcome that has some level of unpredictability 
there are no fixed deliverables that must be met for payment as part of these services 
as such  we recognize revenue under fte contracts on a monthly basis as services are performed according to the terms of the contract 
time and materials 
under a time and materials contract we charge our customers an hourly rate plus reimbursement for chemicals and other project specific costs 
we recognize revenue for time and material contracts based on the number of hours devoted to the project multiplied by the customer s billing rate plus other project specific costs incurred 
fixed fee 
under a fixed fee contract we charge a fixed agreed upon amount for a deliverable 
fixed fee contracts have fixed deliverables upon completion of the project 
typically  we recognize revenue for fixed fee contracts after projects are completed  delivery is made and title transfers to the customer  and collection is reasonably assured 
in certain instances  our customers request that we retain materials produced upon completion of the project due to the fact that the customer does not have a qualified facility to store those materials 
in these instances  the revenue recognition process is considered complete when necessary project documentation batch records  certificates of analysis  etc 
has been delivered to the customer and payment has been collected 
up front license fees  milestone  and royalty revenue 
we recognize revenue from up front non refundable licensing fees on a straight line basis over the period of the underlying project 
we will recognize revenue arising from a substantive milestone payment upon the successful achievement of the event  and the resolution of any uncertainties or contingencies regarding potential collection of the related payment  or if appropriate over the remaining term of the agreement 
deferred revenue 
deferred revenue represents monies received for services that have not yet been performed as well as customer billings related to completed production which has not yet shipped 
as an added service  we temporarily store completed cgmp production at our facilities for certain customers 
under these arrangements  upon completion of the customer project we typically will enter into a storage agreement with the customer 
we will temporarily store and subsequently ship the completed production  often in multiple shipments to multiple sites 
the revenue related to these arrangements is typically recognized at the time the products are ultimately shipped  however  in certain instances  the revenue recognition process is considered complete when necessary project documentation batch records  certificates of analysis  etc 
has been delivered to the customer and payment has been collected  as noted above 
recurring royalty revenue recognition 
recurring royalties consist of royalties under a license agreement with sanofi aventis based on the worldwide sales of fexofenadine hcl  marketed as allegra in the americas and telfast elsewhere 
we record royalty revenue in the period in which the sales of allegra telfast occur 
royalty payments from sanofi aventis are due within days after each calendar quarter and are determined based on sales of allegra telfast in that quarter 
restructuring charges we account for our restructuring costs as required by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for one time termination benefits that meet certain requirements 
inventory inventory consists primarily of commercially available fine chemicals used as raw materials  work in process and finished goods in our large scale manufacturing plant 
large scale manufacturing inventories are valued on a first in  first out fifo basis 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company writes down inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
any such write down results in a charge to operations 
goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill for potential impairment or on an interim basis if certain triggering events occur 
a determination of impairment is made based upon the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired in the future we would be required to record a charge to our results of operations 
factors the company considers important that could result in an impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
total goodwill recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  was million  including million associated with the company s acquisition of amri rensselaer  million of goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of amri hungary  million of goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of amri india in june and million of goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of finekem 
long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  among others  the following a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in the market value of assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment charge is recorded 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds their fair value and will reduce only the carrying amounts of the long lived assets 
equity investments we have equity investments in leveraged private companies that have operations in areas within our strategic focus 
we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting for investments as our ownership interest in each customer is below and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entities 
we assess the fair value of these investments quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstance  such as changes in market conditions  poor operating results of the underlying investments  or the inability of the entities to obtain additional financing indicate that the investment value may not be recoverable 
however  should the events and conditions that are indicative of impairment as noted above arise  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
total equity investments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  were million 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we maintain pension and postretirement costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and trends in health care costs  which are updated on an annual basis 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in the related pension benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
effective december   the company adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no

the allowance and related accounts receivable are reduced when the account is deemed uncollectible 
environmental liabilities in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations  and has made provisions for the estimated financial impact of environmental cleanup related costs 
the quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors  including changing laws and regulations  advancements in environmental technologies  the quality of information available related to specific sites  the assessment stage of each site investigation  preliminary findings and the length of time involved in the remediation or settlement 
the company accrues environmental cleanup related costs when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted sfas r  which amends sfas and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb in establishing standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  as well as transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the share based payment 
this statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees  except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
as allowed under sfas r  the company elected the modified prospective method of adoption  under which compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
compensation cost is based on the fair value of the options on their grant date  and is recognized over the period of requisite service 
the fair value of stock option grants is determined utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including expected volatility in the company s common share price  risk free interest rates  and the expected lives of the options granted  and are updated for each option grant 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including interest rates and the market for the company s common stock  as well as historical data regarding option exercises and forfeitures in making these assumptions 
changes in the related compensation costs associated with future grants may occur due to changes in the assumptions 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the taxable income in the two previous tax years to which tax loss carryback can be applied 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  taxable income in the carryback period and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when considered necessary 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin provides recognition criteria and a related measurement model for tax positions taken by companies 
in accordance with fin  a tax position is a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than  based on technical merits  that the position would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
the adoption of fin did not result in a change to the liability of unrecognized benefits

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in these rates as discussed below 
the company has facilities in singapore  india and hungary and therefore is subject to foreign currency risk 
this risk is composed of both potential losses from the translation of foreign currency financial statements and the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions 
the total net assets of non us operations denominated in non functional currencies subject to potential loss amount to approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately million 
furthermore  related to foreign currency transactions  the company has exposure to non functional currency balances totaling approximately million 
this amount includes  on an absolute basis  exposures to foreign currency assets and liabilities 
on a net basis  the company had approximately million of foreign currency assets as of december  as currency rates change  these non functional currency balances are revalued  and the corresponding adjustment is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
a hypothetical change of in currency rates could result in an adjustment to the consolidated statement of income of approximately million
