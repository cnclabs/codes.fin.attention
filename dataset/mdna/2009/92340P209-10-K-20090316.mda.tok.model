overview we operate in two business segments  biofuels and specialty enzymes 
our biofuels business segment operates through our wholly owned subsidiary  verenium biofuels corporation  and is focused on developing unique technical and operational capabilities designed to enable the production and commercialization of biofuels  in particular ethanol produced from cellulosic biomass 
we believe the most significant near term commercial opportunity for our biofuels business segment is the large scale commercial production of cellulosic ethanol derived from multiple biomass feedstocks  with our initial focus on energy canes and grasses 
our specialty enzymes segment develops high performance enzymes for use within the alternative fuels  specialty industrial processes  and animal nutrition and health markets to enable higher throughput  lower costs  and improved environmental outcomes 
we believe the most significant near term commercial opportunity for our specialty enzymes business segment will be derived from continued sales  and gross product margins from our existing portfolio of enzyme products 
our biofuels and specialty enzymes businesses are both supported by a research and development team with expertise in gene discovery and optimization  cell engineering  bioprocess development  biochemistry and microbiology 
over the past years  our research and development team has developed a proprietary technology platform that has enabled us to apply advancements in science to discovering and developing unique solutions in complex industrial or commercial applications 
we have dedicated substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies  which include capabilities for sample collection from the world s microbial populations  generation of dna libraries  screening of these libraries using ultra high throughput 
table of contents methods capable of analyzing more than one billion genes per day  and optimization based on our gene evolution technologies 
we have continued to shift more of our resources from technology development to commercialization efforts for our existing and future technologies and products 
while our technologies have the potential to serve many large markets  our primary areas of focus for product development are i integrated solutions for the production of advanced biofuels  such as cellulosic ethanol  and ii specialty enzymes for alternative fuels  specialty industrial processes  and animal nutrition and health 
we have current collaborations and agreements with market leaders  such as bp biofuels north america llc  or bp  bunge oils  cargill health and food technologies  and syngenta ag  each of which complement our internal technology and product development efforts 
we expect to continue to invest in these commercialization efforts  primarily in the area of biofuels 
we believe this will not only benefit our mission to advance the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol within our biofuels business unit  but will also enable us to create additional enzyme market opportunities that are focused on external applications for the broader biofuels industry 
we have a substantial intellectual property estate comprising more than issued patents and more than pending patents as of march  we believe that we can leverage our intellectual property estate to enhance and improve our technology development and commercialization efforts across both business units while maintaining protection on key intellectual property assets 
for the year ended december   total revenues increased compared to the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily attributed to a near doubling of our product revenue to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
as part of our strategic reorganization in january  we began to de emphasize grant revenue and certain collaborations that were not strategic to our current market focus in favor of greater emphasis on sales of products 
as a result  we expect that our product revenue will grow as a percentage of our total revenue in the future 
as of december   our strategic collaborations  including our strategic partnership with bp  have provided us with more than million in funding since inception and are committed to additional funding of more than million through  subject to our performance under existing agreements  excluding milestone payments  license and commercialization fees  and royalties or profit sharing 
our committed funding includes million from our second partnership with bp  announced february this second joint venture will act as a separate commercial entity  with the million bp funding used solely for this entity 
our strategic partners often pay us before we recognize the revenue  and these payments are deferred until earned 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue  of which million was related to funding from collaborative partners and million was related to product sales 
we have incurred net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million  a stockholders deficit of million and an accumulated deficit of million 
our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future 
we expect to incur losses into the foreseeable future as a result of any combination of one or more of the following anticipated additional investments to implement our biofuels commercialization strategy  including capital expenditures related to optimization of our demonstration facility  and capital or operating costs we may incur for land acquisition  feedstock development  and design and engineering for our first commercial plants through our joint ventures with bp  maintaining our sales and marketing infrastructure to support our specialty enzyme business  our continued investment in manufacturing facilities necessary to meet anticipated demand for our products  and continued research and development expenses for our internal product candidates 

table of contents results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  we believe that our historical results are not a good indicator of our future operating results 
as more fully described in the risk factors beginning on page  liquidity and capital resources beginning on page and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this report  our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements related to the uncertainty in our ability to continue as a going concern 
while we believe that we will be successful in raising or generating additional cash through a combination of corporate partnerships and collaborations  federal  state and local grant funding and loan guarantees  selling or financing assets  incremental product sales and the sale of equity or debt securities  if we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital from any of these sources  we may need to defer  reduce or eliminate certain planned expenditures  restructure or significantly curtail our operations  file for bankruptcy or cease operations 
recent strategic events  financing transactions  and capital requirements our strategic partnership with bp we have entered into a strategic partnership with bp to accelerate the development and commercialization of cellulosic ethanol  specifically in the field of conversion of biomass to fermentable sugars for the production  or the use in production  of ethanol 
our strategic partnership with bp is critical to our success in validating and commercializing our first generation cellulosic ethanol technology 
this strategic collaboration consists of two phases  which are described below and include a technology development joint venture and a commercial development joint venture 
in august  we announced the initial phase of the partnership  which includes a joint technology development effort that utilizes our broad technology platform in an effort to supply enabling technology to support the development of a portfolio of low cost  environmentally sound cellulosic ethanol production facilities in the united states  and potentially throughout the world 
during the initial month phase of the joint development program  we expect to receive a total of million in connection with our participation 
in connection with the joint development program  we formed galaxy biofuels llc  or galaxy  a special purpose entity  which is equally owned by bp and us  and entered into a joint development and license agreement with bp 
galaxy has access to certain intellectual property rights held or controlled by the parties prior to entering the joint development and license agreement  all of which will continue to be owned by the respective contributing company 
galaxy owns new intellectual property relating to cellulosic ethanol production developed through the joint development program and is responsible for administering the licensing of the technology package resulting from the joint development program 
prior to entering into this strategic partnership  we had no material relationship with bp 
we are primarily responsible for executing the joint development program and have agreed with bp that for a limited period we will not use our existing technology in any other technology development program in the defined field  with certain exceptions 
the limited period may be extended if the joint development program between the parties is extended 
while the primary focus of galaxy is to encourage the use of the technology package resulting from the joint development program in facilities that are jointly owned by bp and us in the united states  galaxy may license the technology and the technology package to us and to bp separately  as well as to third party commercial projects in the united states and elsewhere 
the financial terms of this phase of the strategic partnership include million  payable in three installments  for broad access to our cellulosic ethanol technology platform  production facilities  and employee scientific knowledge and expertise 
we received cash payments of million at closing and million on january  and will receive an additional cash payment of million on july  
table of contents million paid on january  and an additional million per month payable beginning february through and including january to co fund various scientific and technical initiatives within the cellulosic ethanol field 
on february   we announced the second phase of our strategic partnership  a joint venture to develop and commercialize cellulosic ethanol from non food feedstocks 
the joint venture company  highlands ethanol llc  or highlands  is owned equally by us and bp 
highlands will act as the commercial entity for the deployment of cellulosic ethanol technology being developed and proven under our joint development program with bp 
this collaboration is intended to progress the development of one of the nation s first commercial scale cellulosic ethanol facilities  located in highlands county  florida and to create future opportunities for leveraging cellulosic ethanol technologies 
together  we and bp have agreed to commit a total of million in funding and assets to highlands  including an aggregate cash commitment of million from bp and contribution by us of development assets related to our highlands county  florida development project and another commercial project site in early stages of development in the gulf coast region 
highlands will be led and supported by a team comprised of employees from both bp and verenium and will be governed with equal representation from both companies 
highlands will initially focus on developing and securing financing for the commercial scale cellulosic ethanol facility in highlands county  florida and expects to break ground on that site in the estimated construction cost for this mgy facility is between and million 
we expect the first production of cellulosic ethanol from this plant to begin in goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  using fair value measurement techniques 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the goodwill impairment test  which we typically perform annually as of october  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
attributed in part to recent overall global economic and market conditions  we determined that the market value of our common stock and convertible debt was not adequate at september  to support the carrying value of our goodwill resulting from the june merger between diversa and celunol 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million during the third quarter ended september   representing full impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill 
we believe that this impairment is reflective primarily of current market conditions  and is not indicative of a change in our business or implied value of our underlying biofuels business model aimed toward the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol 
financing transactions completion of convertible notes offering in late march and early april  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  or the notes  in a private placement  generating net cash proceeds of approximately million  as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources on page of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
completion of convertible notes offering on february   we completed a private placement of convertible senior notes due april   or the notes  and warrants to purchase our common stock 
concurrent with entering into the purchase 
table of contents agreement  we also entered into senior notes exchange agreements with certain existing holders of our notes pursuant to which such noteholders exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and for warrants to purchase common stock 
including the notes issued in exchange for the notes  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
gross proceeds from new investments were approximately million and net proceeds from new investments  after giving effect to payment of certain transaction related expenses and the cash cost of the convertible hedge transaction  were approximately million  as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources on page of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
years ended december  and selected segment financial data as a result of our merger with celunol on june   our business consists of two business units  which we refer to as our biofuels segment and our specialty enzymes segment 
the biofuels segment is focused on developing unique technical and operational capabilities designed to enable the production and commercialization of biofuels  in particular ethanol from cellulosic biomass 
the specialty enzymes segment develops high performance enzymes for use within the alternative fuels  specialty industrial processes  and animal nutrition and health markets to enable higher throughput  lower costs  and improved environmental outcomes 
we assess performance and allocate resources based on discrete financial information for the biofuels and specialty enzymes segments 
for the biofuels segment  performance is assessed based on total operating expenses and capital expenditures 
for the specialty enzymes segment performance is assessed based on total revenues  product revenues  product gross profit  total operating expenses and capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   the specialty enzyme segment comprised of our product revenue and cost of product revenue 
our operating expenses for each segment include direct and allocated research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in management s evaluation of performance  certain corporate operating expenses are excluded from the business segments such as goodwill impairment charges  non cash share based compensation  restructuring charges  severance  depreciation and amortization  and other corporate expenses  which are not allocated to either business segment 
in addition  we evaluate segment performance based upon capital expenditures and other assets that are specifically identified to the business segment  excluding certain corporate assets such as cash  short term investments  and other assets that can be attributed to  or utilized by  both business segments  and goodwill 
expenses and assets shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments 
different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment 
further  expenses allocated to each of the two segments may not be indicative of the expenses of each operating segment if such segments operated on a stand alone basis 
the results of operations for the year ended december  include the combined operations resulting from our merger with celunol on june  the results of operations for the year ended december  include the historical results of diversa corporation and celunol operations for the period from and including june  through december   and are not reflective of the combined operations for the full year

table of contents consolidated results of operations revenues revenues for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change revenues phyzyme phytase all other products total product collaborative grant total revenues revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher product revenue 
for the year ended december   our revenue mix shifted to a larger percentage of product revenue  consistent with our strategy to grow product sales and de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our strategic market focus 
product revenue represented of total revenues for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  product revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to increased revenue and profit sharing associated with phyzyme xp phytase sold through our collaboration with danisco 
the increase in phyzyme revenue has been primarily related to the following factors in late  the eu commission granted permanent authorization for the use of phyzyme xp in broiler poultry feed in europe which has expanded the end user market for phyzyme xp  in late  danisco introduced a new dry  pelletized  and thermally stable formulation of phyzyme xp  and beginning in late  due to an increase in the cost of phosphates an animal feed additive  sales volumes of phyzyme xp to danisco s current customers have been positively impacted  as many of these customers have increased phyzyme dosages as a replacement for higher cost phosphates 
non phyzyme related product revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increased sales of our fuelzyme lf and purifine products 
this increase was offset by the discontinuation of our bayovac srs and quantum products 
product revenue for the year ended december  includes million of revenue from sales of these products during the first six months of fiscal these products were discontinued due to the following in late  because of new entrants into the vaccine market and resulting pressure on pricing and margins  we made the strategic decision to exit the animal health vaccine market to focus on product commercialization efforts in areas that are more strategic to our current focus  namely biofuels 
in connection with this decision  we terminated our licensing and collaboration agreement with microtek  and discontinued sales of bayovac srs after march   and in february  ab enzymes and ab vista collectively  ab  both subsidiaries of associated british foods plc  announced the acquisition of syngenta s quantum phytase feed enzyme business 
prior to this transaction  we supplied quantum phytase to syngenta pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement 
we were unable to reach a manufacturing and supply agreement with ab on commercially agreeable terms 

table of contents revenue from phyzyme represented approximately of total product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  while we anticipate an increase in revenue from our non phyzyme products  we expect that phyzyme will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total product revenue in the foreseeable future 
we manufacture our enzyme products through a sole source manufacturing facility in mexico city  owned by fermic sa  or fermic 
pursuant to our manufacturing agreement with fermic  we are contractually committed to bring additional manufacturing capacity on line during  which will allow us to meet increasing demand for our enzyme products 
however  due to current capacity constraints at fermic  we are not able to supply adequate quantities of phyzyme necessary to meet the increased demand from danisco 
as a result  we have contracted with genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  to serve as a second source manufacturer for phyzyme 
pursuant to current accounting rules  revenue from phyzyme that is supplied to us by genencor is recognized in an amount equal to the net profit share received from danisco  as compared to the full value of the manufacturing costs plus profit share we currently recognize for phyzyme we manufacture at fermic 
while this revenue recognition treatment should have little or no negative impact on the gross margin we recognize for every sale of phyzyme  it would have a negative impact on the gross product revenue we recognize for phyzyme as the volume of phyzyme manufactured by genencor increases 
collaborative revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  collaborative revenue accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  as compared to of total revenue for the year ended december  we have continued to de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our current focus in favor of greater emphasis on sales of products 
we anticipate that collaborative revenue will continue to decrease in as compared to  due in large part to this de emphasis of non strategic collaborations and decrease in revenue related to the expected wind down of projects with existing strategic collaborators such as syngenta  bunge  and basf 
additionally  under the terms of our year agreement with syngenta  our two year guaranteed funding period totaling million per year expired on december  we do not anticipate that we will continue to receive significant funding from syngenta under this agreement beyond the initial guaranteed funding period 
we will continue to pursue opportunities to expand  renew  or enter into new collaborations that we believe fit our strategic focus and represent product commercialization opportunities in the future  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in renewing or expanding existing collaborations  or securing new collaboration partners 
grant revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  the increase in grant revenue was primarily attributable to a grant awarded in the fourth quarter from the department of energy to discover and develop new enzymes and enzyme cocktails to break down various types of biomass 
we continue to pursue additional opportunities to secure federal  state or local agency funding to support our biofuels initiatives 
as of december   we have committed funding from various governmental agencies totaling million through  and expect to see an increase in grant revenue during as compared to our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the adoption rates of our new and existing commercial products  timing and composition of funding under existing and future collaboration agreements  as well as regulatory approval timelines for new products 
we anticipate that our revenue mix will continue to shift toward a higher percentage of product revenue 
while we have not yet seen an indication that our phyzyme and fuelzyme product revenue will be negatively impacted by the current decline in the global economy  we can not be certain that demand for these products will continue at current levels  given current market conditions 
in contrast  our purifine sales have suffered from the current economic environment 
one of our prime initial targets for purifine is the soybean oil 
table of contents processing market in latin america  which has suffered challenging market conditions since early as a result of this and other factors  our purifine revenue in was below initial expectations 
we expect that current market conditions will continue to put pressure on our sales of purifine 
product gross profit gross margin product gross profit and product gross margin for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change product revenue cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross margin product gross profit totaled million  or of product revenue  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of product revenue  for the year ended december  gross profit and margin improvement is reflective of higher sales volumes to absorb our fixed costs  partially offset by lower than anticipated manufacturing yields for phyzyme and  to a lesser extent  incremental zero margin freight revenue incurred during the first half of to meet customer ship dates which negatively impacted gross profit margin by approximately one percentage point during the year ended december  our product gross margins in were below our target of  primarily due to manufacturing variances related to unfavorable yields and higher raw material prices 
we expect the unfavorable yield variances could continue through until we can better accommodate our recovery capabilities  which may require additional investment in downstream recovery capacity at fermic 
over time  our gross margins should be positively impacted by continued growth in sales of our enzyme products  as well as cost efficiencies we would expect to achieve if we continue to scale up production and improve our manufacturing yields 
because a large percentage of our manufacturing costs are fixed  we should realize continued margin improvements as product revenues increase  however  our margins may be negatively impacted in the future if our product revenues do not grow in line with our increase in minimum capacity requirements at fermic 
for example  we are planning to further expand our manufacturing capabilities during  which will increase our fixed manufacturing costs by an additional million per quarter 
in addition  our gross margins are dependent upon the mix of product related sales as the cost of product related revenue varies from product to product 
because phyzyme represents a significant percentage of our product revenue  our product gross margin is impacted to a great degree by the gross margin achieved on sales of phyzyme 
under our agreement with danisco  we sell our phyzyme inventory to danisco at our cost and then share of danisco s profit  as defined  when the product is sold to the end user 
as a result  our total cost of product revenue for phyzyme is incurred as we ship product to danisco  and profit share revenue is recognized in the period in which the product is sold to the end user as reported to us by danisco 
we may record our quarterly profit share revenue based on estimates from danisco  and the final calculation of profit share is sometimes finalized in the subsequent quarter  accordingly  we are subject to potential adjustments to our actual profit share revenue from quarter to quarter 
these adjustments  while typically considered immaterial in absolute dollars  could have a significant impact on our reported product gross margin from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our supply agreement with danisco for phyzyme contains provisions which allow danisco  with six months advance notice  to assume manufacturing rights for phyzyme 
if danisco decides to exercise this right  we will likely experience excess capacity at fermic 
if we are unable to absorb this excess capacity with other products in the event that danisco assumes all or a portion of phyzyme manufacturing rights  this will have a negative impact on our product gross profit and gross margin 

table of contents our product gross margin is dependent upon the mix of product sales as the cost of product revenue varies from product to product 
we believe that our product gross margin should be positively impacted as we grow sales of products we market and sell directly to end users  namely fuelzyme lf and purifine  which are expected to have higher gross margins than our phyzyme products 
cost of product revenue includes both fixed and variable costs  including materials and supplies  labor  facilities and other overhead costs  associated with our product revenues 
excluded from cost of product revenue are costs associated with the scale up of manufacturing processes for new products that have not reached commercial scale production volumes  which we include in our research and development expenses 
cost of product revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the increase in product revenues  and to a lesser extent  the increase in our fixed manufacturing costs under our contract with fermic 
operating expenses research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change research and development selling  general and administrative expenses the operating expenses for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year ended december   related primarily to the biofuels business only being included in operating expenses since the closing of the june merger with celunol  as well as our acceleration of biofuels development and commercialization efforts in research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with internal development of our technologies and our product candidates  including engineering costs associated with out pilot and demonstration scale cellulosic ethanol facilities  manufacturing scale up and bioprocess development for our current products  and costs associated with research activities performed on behalf of our collaborators 
for the year ended december  we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on internal product and technology development  and that approximately on research activities funded by our collaborators and grants 
for the year ended december  we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on internal product and technology development  and that approximately on research activities funded by our collaborators and grants 
the increase in time spent on internal product and technology development from the prior year is primarily attributed to our focus on cellulosic ethanol process development since the merger with celunol  and to a lesser extent  bioprocess development and technical support for our enzyme products that have already been introduced commercially 
we have a limited history of developing commercial products and technologies 
we determine which products and technologies to pursue independently based on various criteria  including investment required  estimated time to market  regulatory hurdles  infrastructure requirements  and industry specific expertise necessary for successful commercialization 
successful products and technologies require significant development and investment prior to regulatory approval and commercialization 
as a result of the significant risks and uncertainties involved in developing and commercializing such products  we are unable to estimate the nature  timing  and cost of the efforts necessary to complete each of our major projects 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following our products and technologies may require more resources than we anticipate if we are technically unsuccessful in initial development or commercialization efforts  
table of contents the outcome of research is unknown until each stage of testing is completed  up through and including trials and regulatory approvals  if needed  it can take many years from the initial decision to perform research through development until products and technologies  if any  are ultimately marketed  and we have product candidates and technologies in various stages of development related to collaborations and grants as well as internally developed products and technologies 
at any time  we may modify our strategy and pursue additional collaborations for the development and commercialization of some products and technologies that we had intended to pursue independently 
for example  in we entered into a joint collaboration with bp to co fund the advancement and validation of our cellulosic ethanol process technology  which had previously been largely self funded 
any one of these risks and uncertainties could have a significant impact on the nature  timing  and costs to complete our product and technology development efforts 
accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential commercialization candidates we may proceed with  the time and costs to complete development  and ultimately whether we will have any products or technologies approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies 
the various risks associated with our research and development activities are discussed more fully in this report under risk factors 
our research and development expenses increased million  to million including share based compensation of million compared to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  our research and development expenses by operating segment for the years ended december  and were as follow in thousands change biofuels specialty enzymes biofuels research and development research and development expenses related to our biofuels business include cost related to our ongoing development and validation of our cellulosic ethanol process technology  including  but not limited to  enzyme discovery and development and bioprocess development designed to improve ethanol yields and reduce cost per gallon  feedstock testing and validation at the laboratory  pilot and demo plant scale  as well as costs related to commissioning  optimization and operation of our demo plant in jennings  louisiana 
our biofuels research and development expenses increased million from to this increase is related to two factors 
first  our expenses include a full twelve months of post merger biofuels related expenses  while in our expenses included only about six months of post merger expenses 
second  we accelerated our biofuels technology development efforts during  particularly related to our demo plant start up and commissioning at our site in jennings  louisiana 
we consider our current cellulosic ethanol technology under development to be our generation or gen technology 
to date  we have demonstrated that our gen technology can produce cellulosic ethanol at a small scale in the laboratory  pilot plant  and demonstration plant  but at yields and cost that are not yet commercially viable 
we will require continued and substantial investment to further develop our gen technology  and continue to believe that gen will produce a viable technology that will be deployed on a commercial scale as early as 
table of contents specialty enzymes research and development research and development expenses related to our specialty enzyme business include costs related to ongoing bioprocess development and manufacturing process yield improvements  funded support for research collaborations and to a lesser extent  early stage product development 
our specialty enzymes research and development expenses decreased million from to this decrease is related primarily to our shift in focus to biofuels process development after the merger with celunol on june   and to a lesser extent the de emphasis of early stage product development for our specialty enzyme business segment and collaboration and grant work not core to our current focus 
due to limited capital resources and challenging economic conditions expected in  we do not anticipate that we will spend significant resources on early stage specialty enzyme product development during without additional investment from strategic partners 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  this increase is largely due to incremental personnel and overhead costs resulting from the merger with celunol in june  incremental legal expense  consulting and advisory expenses related to the first phase of our collaboration with bp  and  to a lesser extent  increased personnel costs and professional services costs to support the growth in product sales and increased complexity of our business 
these increases were partially offset by charges incurred during of million related to severance  bonus and modifications to equity awards pursuant to transitional employment and severance agreements with certain executives after the completion of the merger with celunol in june share based compensation charges we recognized million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and these charges had no impact on our reported cash flows 
share based compensation expense was allocated among the following expense categories in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative share based compensation increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily related to additional grants related to new hires during included in share based compensation for the year ended december  are non recurring charges of million related to modification of vesting for restricted stock awards for certain executives in connection with separation agreements relating to the merger with celunol 
goodwill impairment during the third quarter of  we determined that the market value of our common stock and convertible debt was not adequate at september  to support the carrying value of our goodwill resulting from the june merger between diversa and celunol 
as a result  pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a non cash charge of million during the quarter ended september   representing full impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill 
we believe that this impairment is reflective primarily of current market conditions  and is not indicative of a change in our business or implied value of our underlying biofuels business model aimed toward the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol 

table of contents acquired in process research and development we allocated million of the purchase price in connection with our merger with celunol in june to acquired in process research and development projects 
acquired in process research and development ipr d represents the valuation of acquired  to be completed research projects 
celunol s ongoing research and development initiatives have primarily involved the development of its patented and proprietary biotechnology to enable production of fuel grade ethanol from cellulosic biomass materials 
as of the merger date  pursuant to authoritative guidance under sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  these projects were not determined to have reached technological feasibility and determined to have no alternative future use 
accordingly  the amounts allocated to those projects were written off in the second quarter of  the period the merger was consummated 
restructuring charges we recorded charges of million during the year ended december  in connection with our strategic reorganization in january  which included costs for employee separation and estimates for facilities consolidation costs 
during the years ended december  and december   we recorded million and million of additional charges reflecting revisions in our estimates and present value adjustments for our remaining net facilities consolidation costs 
our revision in december was primarily related to executing our sublease agreement with a subtenant in october we may further revise these estimates in future periods  which could give rise to additional charges or adjustments 
interest expense  net interest income on cash and short term investments was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances during interest expense was million  net of million in capitalized interest for the demonstration facility  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   net of million in capitalized interest for the demonstration facility 
the increase was attributed to interest on the notes we issued in march and april combined with the notes issued in february we recorded aggregate interest expense related to the notes of million for the year ended december   representing the following in thousands coupon interest  payable in cash non cash accretion of debt discount  net of premium amortization non cash amortization of debt issuance costs write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts related to converted notes aggregate debt discount costs of million and financing costs of million are being accreted into interest expense over the term of the debt  or approximately four years 
loss on exchange of convertible notes in connection with the issuance of the notes  we exchanged million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
pursuant to current accounting rules  we recorded a non cash loss on the exchange of million  equal to the difference between the carrying value of the notes and the fair value of the notes and warrants issued 

table of contents gain on net change in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities the fair value of the compound embedded derivative  warrants  and the convertible hedge transaction in connection with our notes are recorded as a derivative asset or liability and marked to market each balance sheet date 
the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as change in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net gain of million related to the change in fair value of our recorded derivative asset and liabilities between the closing date of february  and december  loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in galaxy biofuels llc in connection with the initial phase of our strategic partnership with bp  we formed galaxy as a special purpose entity 
we are considered the primary beneficiary of galaxy and consolidate its financial results 
pursuant to current accounting rules  the transaction fees and joint development fees are accounted for as follows the license to technology we granted to galaxy and ongoing joint development work we perform for galaxy are considered capital contributions to galaxy  transaction fees and joint development fees paid by bp are considered capital contributions to galaxy  which are subsequently distributed to us as a reduction to our capital account  ongoing joint development is considered a monthly expense of galaxy 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements include a line item called noncontrolling interest in galaxy biofuels llc 
on our consolidated balance sheet  this line reflects bp s ownership of galaxy s equity 
this line item is reduced by bp s share of galaxy s profits and losses  and increased by cash distributions made by bp to us on behalf of galaxy 
bp s share of galaxy s losses is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations as loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in galaxy biofuels llc 
galaxy has incurred approximately million in losses through december   of which have been allocated to bp 
we anticipate galaxy will continue to incur losses related to ongoing joint development through at least the initial months of the joint development program

our revenue mix has shifted to a larger percentage of product revenue  consistent with our strategy to grow product sales and de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our strategic market focus 
product revenue for the year ended december  increased million or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to increased revenue and profit sharing associated with our phyzyme product sold through our collaboration with danisco  for the reasons described above in comparing and results

collaborative revenue decreased  or million  to million from million and accounted for and of total revenue for the years ended december  and this decrease is primarily a result of the restructuring of our collaboration with syngenta at the beginning of we have continued to de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our current focus in favor of greater emphasis on sales of products

cost of product revenue includes both fixed and variable costs  including materials and supplies  labor  facilities and other overhead costs  associated with our product revenues 
excluded from cost of product revenue are costs associated with the scale up of manufacturing processes for new products that have not reached commercial scale production volumes  which we include in our research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   cost of product related revenue increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the increase in our fixed manufacturing costs under our contract with fermic  sa  or fermic  our manufacturing partner in mexico city  as well as the increase in product revenues 
despite the increase in fixed costs our gross margin improved to in from in research and development for the year ended december  we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on internal product and technology development  and that approximately on research activities funded by our collaborators and grants 
for the year ended december  we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on internal product and technology development  and that approximately on research activities funded by our collaborators and grants 
the increase in time spent on internal product and technology development from the prior year is primarily attributed to our merger completed june  and the focus on cellulosic ethanol process development  and to a lesser extent  bioprocess development and technical support for our enzyme products that have already been introduced commercially

our committed funding includes million from our second joint venture with bp  announced february this second partnership will act as a separate commercial entity  with the million bp funding used solely for this entity 
our future committed funding is subject to our performance under existing agreements  and is concentrated within a limited number of collaborators 
our failure to successfully maintain our relationships with these collaborators could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
capital requirements as of december   we had available cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  excluding approximately million in restricted cash 
historically  we have funded our capital equipment purchases through available cash  capital leases and equipment financing line of credit agreements 
since we announced our merger with celunol in february  we have issued million of convertible debt to fund our cellulosic ethanol pilot and demonstration scale facilities and other working capital requirements 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million 

table of contents we will require additional capital to fund our operations 
our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements related to the substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern 
our cash at december   along with anticipated cash from grants  revenue  our commitment from bp and other sources may not be sufficient to meet cash requirements to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures  potential payments under our notes  and working capital through december  without additional sources of cash 
we will also need to raise sufficient capital to fund the construction of the first commercial cellulosic ethanol plant in highlands county  florida 
we recently entered into a joint venture with bp intended to advance the design and engineering of the commercial facility  and we expect to break ground on this facility in we estimate that the total costs of construction for this first commercial plant will be to million which we anticipate will be funded from a combination of non recourse debt and equity capital 
we and bp recently filed a joint application for a department of energy loan guarantee program 
while funding from this program could cover as much as of the total capital cost of the project  if awarded  we expect this program would fund to of our cost of construction 
we expect the remaining to will be funded by equal project equity investments from bp and us 
this will require us to raise project equity capital of up to million in addition to the cash required to fund our corporate operations 
we believe that we will be successful in generating additional cash to fund our operations through a combination of additional corporate partnerships and collaborations  federal  state and local grant funding  incremental product sales  selling or financing assets  and  if necessary and available  the sale of equity or debt securities 
if we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital from any of these sources  we may need to defer  reduce or eliminate certain planned expenditures 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any sources of financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to defer  reduce or eliminate our expenditures  secure additional sources of revenue or otherwise secure additional funding  we may need to restructure or significantly curtail our operations  divest all or a portion of our business  file for bankruptcy or cease operations 
completion of convertible notes offering in late march and early april  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  or the notes  in a private placement  generating net cash proceeds of approximately million 
the notes have been registered under the securities act of  as amended  to permit registered resale of the notes and of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the notes bear interest at per year  payable in cash semi annually  and are convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to maturity  redemption or repurchase into shares of verenium common stock at a conversion rate shares per  principal amount  which represents a conversion price of per share 
the conversion rate of the notes may be increased in certain circumstances if a holder surrenders their notes for conversion in connection with a make whole fundamental change that occurs before april  on or after april   we may  at our option  redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
on each of april   april  and april   holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date 
holders may also require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon a fundamental change at a repurchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  a fundamental change is broadly defined as a change in control  or a termination of trading of our common stock 

table of contents we have used the net proceeds of the notes offering for continued expansion of our biofuels business  including construction of a demonstration scale ethanol facility  biofuels technology development  continued investment in product development and commercialization efforts in our specialty enzyme business  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
completion of convertible notes offering on february   we completed a private placement of convertible senior notes due april   or the notes  and warrants to purchase our common stock 
concurrent with entering into the purchase agreement  we also entered into senior notes exchange agreements with certain existing holders of our notes pursuant to which such noteholders exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and for warrants to purchase common stock 
including the notes issued in exchange for the notes  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
gross proceeds from new investments were approximately million and net proceeds from new investments  after giving effect to payment of certain transaction related expenses and the cash cost of the convertible hedge transaction described below  were approximately million 
we are required to pay interest on the notes at the rate of per year  and the notes also include a make whole provision whereby  upon any holder s conversion of the notes for common stock  we are obligated to pay such holder an amount equal to the interest foregone over the life of the notes based on such conversion  discounted back to the date of conversion using the published yield on two year us treasury notes as the discount rate 
the notes provide that we may  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including that the shares to be issued must be registered for resale under a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission  pay interest or make whole amounts with shares of our common stock at a discount to the applicable stock price at the time of the interest payment or conversion 
the registration statement that we filed with the securities and exchange commission to register the resale of the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes  along with interest shares and shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants  only registers a limited number of conversion shares and interest shares  and our ability to pay make whole payments and interest payments under the notes using shares is accordingly limited 
as of march   our potential maximum remaining make whole obligation assuming conversion of of the notes on that date was approximately million  a substantial portion of which we may be required to settle in cash 
were many holders of our notes to convert their notes  or if a significant amount were converted at approximately the same time  our cash resources at that time could be insufficient to make the required make whole payments 
any such inability on our part to make the registered make whole payments in cash could potentially have a number of negative consequences including  among others  that i we could be forced to defer  reduce or eliminate certain existing and projected operating expenses and capital requirements  ii we could be forced to seek to raise capital  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  particularly given recent conditions in the united states and global equity and credit markets  iii we could default on our obligation to make any required cash make whole and other payments under the notes and any such default could cause a default under our other outstanding debt and result in payments under the notes and such other debt being accelerated  and iv we could be forced to cease operations 
as of december  and march   we had million and million  respectively  in face value outstanding under the notes 
in connection with the conversions of the notes occurring between january  and march   we issued approximately million shares of our common stock  including approximately million shares to satisfy a portion of the related make whole obligations 
cash payments to satisfy make whole obligations during this time were insignificant 
the conversion price for the notes is and is also subject to full ratchet anti dilution protection 
in addition  the notes are subject to automatic conversion at our option if our closing stock price exceeds per share over a trading day period ending prior to the date we provides notice of the automatic

the warrants are exercisable and the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant are for shares of our common stock 
the initial exercise price of the warrants is per share 
the exercise price is subject to weighted average anti dilution protection 
in connection with the transactions described above  we entered into a convertible hedge transaction with a counterparty  which is intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes 
the convertible hedge transaction is composed of two separate call options 
under the first call option  on april  or earlier upon conversion of the notes  we are entitled to purchase  shares of our common stock from the counterparty at a price per share equal to the initial conversion price of or a proportion of such number of shares based on the proportion of the notes being converted 
under the second call option  on three exercise dates staggered in six month intervals beginning on october   the counterparty is entitled to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
the cash cost of the convertible hedge transaction was approximately million 
during  we used the net proceeds from the sale of our notes and warrants for general corporate and working capital purposes  including the completion of construction and commissioning of our cellulosic ethanol demonstration facility

due to securities and exchange commission limitations on the amount of shares we were permitted to register in the resale registration statement we filed with the securities and exchange commission to register the resale of the interest shares  along with the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes and shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants  we only registered a limited number of interest shares  and as a result we intend to continue paying a significant portion of our quarterly interest payments in cash

in early we achieved a key development milestone with our million gallon per year demonstration scale cellulosic ethanol facility in jennings  louisiana with the commissioning of the facility 
as a result  we just recently produced our first gallons of cellulosic ethanol out of the plant 
work to optimize the facility and make process improvements has commenced as we seek to ensure reliable and cost effective operation 
we will require significant additional capital and operating expenditures to complete the optimization of our demonstration scale facility in we do not have fixed priced arrangements with our major engineering and construction firms  as such  most of our engineering and construction costs related to our demonstration facility are incurred and paid on a time and materials basis 
during and  we incurred significant costs in excess of our projected expenditures for the improvements to our pilot plant and construction of our demonstration plant

these costs scale up as our projected manufacturing volume increases 
as of december   under this agreement over the next three years we have made minimum commitments to fermic of approximately million 
in august  celunol corp 
entered into a commitment to purchase a piece of equipment for the demonstration plant in the amount of million  of which million was paid upon signing the agreement and an additional million upon shipment which occurred in september the remaining balance of million is to be paid ratably over the month period beginning january and is included in liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and manufacturing and supply agreements during  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with fermic to provide us with the capacity to produce commercial quantities of certain enzyme products 
based on actual and projected increased product requirements  the agreement was amended in to provide for additional capacity to be installed over the next two years 
under the terms of the agreement  we can cancel the committed purchases with thirty months notice provided that the term of the agreement  including the termination notice period  aggregates four years 
pursuant to our agreement with fermic  we are also obligated to reimburse monthly costs related to manufacturing activities 
these costs scale up as our projected manufacturing volume increases 
as of december   under this agreement we have made minimum commitments to fermic of approximately million  over the next three years 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement  we are required to purchase certain equipment required for fermentation and downstream processing of the products 
through december   we had incurred costs of approximately million for equipment related to this agreement 
during  we anticipate funding as much as million in additional equipment costs related to our manufacturing agreement with fermic 
as we continue to develop our commercial manufacturing platforms  we will be required to purchase additional capital equipment under this agreement 
due to current capacity constraints at fermic  we are not able to supply adequate quantities of phyzyme necessary to meet the increased demand from danisco 
as a result  we have contracted with genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  to serve as a second source manufacturer for phyzyme 
our supply agreement with danisco for phyzyme contains provisions which allow danisco  with six months advance notice  to assume the right to manufacture phyzyme 
if danisco were to exercise this right  we would likely experience significant 
table of contents excess capacity at fermic 
if danisco assumed the right to manufacture phyzyme and we were unable to absorb the excess capacity at fermic with other products  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
bank debt on september   we entered into a million loan and security agreement the bank agreement with a commercial bank the bank

the bank agreement contains standard affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions on actions by us including  but not limited to  activity related to common stock repurchases  liens  investments  indebtedness  and fundamental changes in  or dispositions of  our assets 
we may take certain of these actions with the consent of the bank 
on february   we executed an amendment to the bank agreement 
pursuant to the amendment  in exchange for the bank s consent to the private placement of our notes and warrants  we agreed to expand the scope of the security interest under the loan and security agreement to include substantially all of our assets excluding our intellectual property 
in return  the bank modified our minimum cash covenant to reduce the required minimum liquidity from million to an amount equal to of the total amount of our obligations to the bank under the bank agreement 
at december   there was approximately million in outstanding borrowings under the equipment advances and a letter of credit for approximately million under the letter of credit sublimit  as required under our facilities leases

as of december   we had a letter of credit in place pursuant to this agreement for approximately million  representing the  minimum and approximately months current rent 
the letter of credit is issued under our existing bank agreement as described above 
we are required by the bank to secure this obligation with cash  which is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  on january   we increased the amount of our letter of credit to million from million to reflect an increase in our contractual rent payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that would give rise to additional material contractual obligations as of december  
table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  long lived assets  accrued liabilities  and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill as a result of the merger with celunol on june   we recorded million of goodwill on our balance sheet  all of which was allocated to our biofuels reporting unit 
we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we used the discounted cash flow method to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired 
the estimates used to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and were based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  using fair value measurement techniques 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the goodwill impairment test  which we typically perform annually as of october st  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined primarily through a market based approach  based upon the market value of our common stock and convertible debt 
during the third quarter of  we initiated an evaluation to determine if current company specific or market conditions would give rise to potential impairment of our goodwill carrying value  including  but not limited to  the following the significant decline in the market value of our invested capital  including the market value of our common stock and convertible debt  sustained operating losses and demonstration plant cost overages  and significant cash shortfalls and working capital deficiencies 
based upon the foregoing  we initiated a step and step analysis for impairment as prescribed by sfas  with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
the first step of the two step impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if an impairment indicator exists 
if an impairment indicator exists  then the second step of the impairment test must be performed to determine the amount of impairment  if any 

table of contents under the first step  in assessing the fair value of its biofuels reporting unit  we primarily considered the market approach under which the implied fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices and the number of shares outstanding for our common stock  and the fair value of our convertible debt 
we determined that the implied fair value of the biofuels reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit and that step two of the impairment test was required 
under the second step  we determined the implied fair value of the goodwill and compared it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
we allocated the fair value of the reporting unit to all of our assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the biofuels reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
under this analysis  the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to our assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
our step two analysis resulted in no implied fair value of goodwill 
as a result  we recognized a non cash charge of million in the third quarter of  representing full impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill 
revenue recognition we follow the provisions as set forth by current accounting rules  which primarily include the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue when we have satisfied all contractual obligations and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing the revenue under current accounting rules 
in those instances where we have billed our customers or received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue  we include the amounts in deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we generate revenue from research collaborations generally through funded research  up front fees to initiate research projects  fees for exclusivity in a field  and milestones 
we recognize revenue from research funding on a proportional performance basis  as research hours are incurred under each agreement 
we recognize fees to initiate research over the life of the project 
we recognize revenue from exclusivity fees over the period of exclusivity 
our collaborations often include contractual milestones 
when we achieve these milestones  we are entitled to payment  as defined by the underlying agreements 
we recognize revenue for milestone payments when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process  iii the milestone payment is non refundable and iv our past research and development services  as well as our ongoing commitment to provide research and development services under the collaboration  are charged at fees that are comparable to the fees that the we customarily charges for similar research and development services 
we recognize revenue from grants as related costs are incurred  as long as such costs are within the funding limits specified by the underlying grant agreements 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of our inventory as we ship or deliver products  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recognize revenue from products sold through distributors or other third party arrangements upon shipment of the products  if the distributor has a right of return  provided that a the price is substantially fixed and determinable at the time of sale  b the distributor s obligation to pay us is not contingent upon resale of the products  c title and risk of loss passes to the distributor at time of shipment  d the distributor has economic substance apart from that provided by us  e we have no significant obligation to the distributor to bring about resale of the products  and f future returns can be reasonably estimated 
for any sales that do not meet all of the above criteria  revenue is deferred until all such criteria have been met 
we include our profit sharing revenues in product revenues on the statement of operations 
we recognize profit sharing revenues during the quarter in which such profit sharing revenues are earned based on calculations provided by our profit sharing partner 
to date  we have generated a substantial portion of our product revenues  including profit sharing revenues  through our agreements with danisco 

table of contents we sometimes enter into revenue arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
in these cases  we recognize revenue from each element of the arrangement as long as we are able to determine a separate value for each element  we have completed our obligation to deliver or perform on that element and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
share based compensation effective january   we calculate the fair value of all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including grants of stock options  non restricted and restricted shares  and awards issued under the employee stock purchase plan  and amortize these fair values to share based compensation in the income statement over the respective vesting periods of the underlying awards 
share based compensation related to stock options includes both the amortization of the fair value of options at the date of grant determined using black scholes merton bsm valuation model 
we amortize the fair value of options to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying options 
share based compensation related to awards issued under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  after december  are based on calculations of fair value under the bsm valuation model which are similar to how stock option valuations are made 
we amortize the fair value of espp awards to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards and awards under the espp on the date of grant using assumptions about volatility  expected life of the awards  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield rate 
the expected volatility in this model is based on the historical volatility of our common stock and an analysis of our peers 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time awards are granted  based on maturities which approximate the expected life of the options 
the expected life of the options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees and an analysis of our peers 
the expected dividend rate takes into account the absence of any historical payments and management s intention to retain all earnings for future operations and expansion 
we estimate the fair value of non restricted and restricted stock awards based upon the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
we charge the fair value of non restricted awards to share based compensation upon grant 
we amortize the fair value of restricted awards to share based compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying awards 
convertible debt and derivative accounting we perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for  and  if bifurcation requirements are met  whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liability 
under equity accounting  the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially and included in stockholders equity  and remeasurement is not required 
under liability accounting  the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially  included as a liability on the balance sheet  and remeasured each reporting period 
any changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations 
we monitor  on an on ongoing basis  whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features 
variable interest entities we have implemented the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 as amended 
fin r addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities either that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or in which the 
table of contents equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
in connection with the initial phase of our strategic partnership with bp  we formed a special purpose entity  galaxy biofuels llc for purposes of maintaining and licensing cellulosic ethanol process technologies 
we and bp share equally in the rights and obligations of galaxy 
we have determined that the spe is a variable interest entity under fin r  and therefore is subject to consolidation 
we have also determined  pursuant to fin r  that verenium is the primary beneficiary of galaxy  accordingly  the results of operations of galaxy should be included in our consolidated statement of operations 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements include a line item called noncontrolling interest in galaxy biofuels llc 
on our consolidated balance sheet  this line reflects bp s ownership of galaxy s equity 
this line item will be reduced by bp s share of galaxy s profits and losses  and increased by cash distributions made by bp to us on behalf of galaxy 
bp s share of galaxy s losses is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations as loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in galaxy biofuels llc 
galaxy has incurred approximately million in losses through december   of which have been allocated to bp 
we anticipate galaxy will continue to incur losses related to ongoing joint development through at least the initial months of the strategic partnership 
long lived assets we review long lived assets  including leasehold improvements  property and equipment  and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
this requires us to estimate future cash flows related to these assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which may affect the carrying amount of assets and the related amortization expense 
income taxes effective in  we account for income taxes pursuant fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax return 
under fin  we do not recognize an uncertain tax position as a deferred tax asset if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january   and commenced analyzing filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
as a result of adoption  we have recorded no additional tax liability 
as of december  we have not yet completed our analysis of our deferred tax assets for net operating losses of million and research and development credits of million generated in years prior to and net operating losses of million and research and development credits of million generated in as such  we have removed these amounts and the offsetting valuation allowance has been removed from our deferred tax assets 
we are in the process of completing a section analysis regarding the limitation of the net operating loss and research and development credits 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   we had million in gross deferred tax assets  excluding any estimated deferred tax assets related to our nol s and r d credits 
our deferred tax assets at december  were fully offset by a valuation allowance 

table of contents inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value and  if necessary  reduce the value by an estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the determination of the need for an allowance is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales  as well as  judgments  quality control testing data  and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence 
capitalized interest we capitalize interest on capital projects  namely our cellulosic ethanol demonstration facility  commencing with the first expenditure for the project and continuing until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we amortize the capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight line method over the same lives as the related assets 
recently issued accounting standards information with respect to recent accounting standards is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency risk 
interest rate exposure as of december   we had outstanding debt obligations at face value of million  including million of notes  million of notes  and million of equipment loans payable 
as of december   the fair value of our notes was approximately million and the fair value of our notes was approximately million 
foreign currency exposure we engage third parties  including fermic  our contract manufacturing partner in mexico city  to provide various services 
from time to time certain of these services result in obligations that are denominated in other than us dollars 
foreign currency risk is minimized because the amount of such obligations is not material
