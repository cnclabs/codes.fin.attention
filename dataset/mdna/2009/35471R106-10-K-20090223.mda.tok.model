overview fsp corp  or the company  operates in two business segments real estate operations and investment banking investment services 
the real estate operations segment involves real estate rental operations  leasing  secured financing of real estate for interim acquisition or other property financing  and services provided for asset management  property management  property acquisitions  dispositions and development 
the investment banking investment services segment involves the structuring of real estate investments and broker dealer services that include the organization of sponsored reits  the acquisition and development of real estate on behalf of sponsored reits and the raising of capital to equitize the sponsored reits through sale of preferred stock in private placements 
the main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the united states 
these market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level 
we have no influence on the national market conditions 
we look to acquire and or develop quality properties in good locations in order to lessen the impact of downturns in the market and to take advantage of upturns when they occur 
our investment banking investment services customers are primarily institutions and high net worth individuals 
to the extent that the broad capital markets affect these investors our business is also affected 
these investors have many investment choices 
we must continually search for real estate at a price and at a competitive risk reward rate of return that meets our customer s risk reward profile for providing a stream of income and as a long term hedge against inflation 
trends and uncertainties economic conditions the economy in the united states is currently experiencing unprecedented disruptions  including increased levels of unemployment  the failure and near failure of a number of large financial institutions  reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for a number of market participants 
economic conditions may be affected by numerous factors including but not limited to  inflation and employment levels  energy prices  recessionary concerns  changes in currency exchange rates  the availability of debt and interest rate fluctuations 
the current disruptions in the us economy have affected our business and may affect real estate values  occupancy levels  property income and the propensity and the ability of investors to invest in our sponsored reits in the future 
at this time  we cannot predict the extent or duration of any negative impact that the current disruptions in the us economy will have on our business 
on july   we announced that we had reduced our regular quarterly dividend to per share of common stock for the three months ended june   which was paid on august  in our july  announcement  we noted that we had experienced a significant slowing of activity in  and lower profit contribution from  two transactional components of our business  investment banking investment services and property dispositions  since the onset of the current disruptions in the us economy 
we also noted that our ongoing recurring real estate operations continued to show solid performance and that our board of directors believed it was prudent to better align our regular quarterly dividends with the results of our current real estate operations only  without taking into account the results of our less predictable transactional operations 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we continued to experience a significant slowing of activity in  and lower profit contribution from  two transactional components of our business  investment banking investment services and property dispositions 
however  during the third and fourth quarters of  our real estate operations continued to show steady performance  and we announced a dividend of per share of common stock for the three months ended september  that was paid on november  and a dividend of per share of common stock for the three months ended december  that was paid on february  real estate operations our real estate portfolio was approximately leased as of december  and although approximately of the square footage in our portfolio was scheduled to expire in  we maintained our occupancy rate during primarily as a result of our leasing efforts 
while we were able to maintain occupancy rates during  new leasing activity has slowed in most of our markets  and we do not expect to see an increase in the pace of leasing until the broader economic markets stabilize and there is new job growth 
in addition  as progressed  we noticed an increase in the costs of leasing in the form of free rent and tenant improvement allowances in some of our markets 
we believe that this increase in the costs of leasing is attributable to the current economic downturn  which has forced landlords to compete for an increasingly diminishing pool of quality tenants 
we do not expect this trend to reverse itself until demand for office space increases 
approximately of the square footage in our portfolio is scheduled to expire in while we cannot predict when existing vacancy will be leased or if existing tenants with expiring leases will renew their leases or what the terms and conditions of the lease renewals will be  we expect to renew or sign new leases at current market rates for locations in which the buildings are located  which in some cases may be below the expiring rates 
given the current economic downturn  the potential for any of our tenants to default on its lease or to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws has increased 
if any of our tenants defaults on its lease  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
in addition  at any time  a tenant of one of our properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws  which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
on november   landamerica financial group  inc filed a voluntary motion for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
landamerica financial group  inc is currently a subtenant of capital one services  inc at our innsbrook property in glen allen  virginia through october commencing on november   landamerica financial group  inc is scheduled to become our direct tenant for the entire project  which contains an aggregate of approximately  rentable square feet of space 
accordingly  capital one services  inc remains financially obligated to us for all payments of rent through october as of february   no motion to assume or reject the direct lease had been filed by landamerica financial group  inc at this time we do not know if and cannot predict whether landamerica financial group  inc will assume or reject its direct lease with us 
in the event that landamerica financial group  inc does reject its direct lease with us  we cannot predict how long it would take to lease the vacant space or what the terms and conditions of any new lease or leases would be  although we would expect to sign new leases at current market rates which may be below the expiring rates 
if the landamerica financial group  inc direct lease is rejected and no replacement tenant or tenants are in place prior to the expiration of the capital one services  inc lease on october   then the total square footage in our portfolio scheduled to expire in would increase by approximately  to a total of approximately 
investment banking investment services unlike our real estate operations business  which provides a rental revenue stream which is ongoing and recurring in nature  our investment banking investment services business is transactional in nature 
equity raised for sponsored reit syndications for decreased to million compared to million in in september  one of our sponsored reits purchased an office property located in kansas city  missouri 
permanent equity capitalization of the property was structured as a private placement preferred stock offering totaling million of which million has been raised as of december  in june  one of our sponsored reits began development of an office property located in broomfield  colorado 
permanent equity capitalization of the property was structured as a private placement offering of preferred stock totaling million of which million has been raised as of december  both of these private placements are ongoing as of the beginning of the slowdown in our investment banking business actually began in the third quarter of and  at this point  it remains unclear when or if a higher volume of equity investment will return 
business in this area  while always uncertain  continues to be adversely affected by the current turmoil in the financial  debt and real estate markets 
investors who have historically participated in our private placement real estate offerings continue to express concern and uncertainty about investing in this environment 
in addition to difficulties in raising equity from potential real estate investors in this market  our property acquisition executives are now grappling with greater uncertainty surrounding the valuation levels for prime commercial investment real estate 
we believe that the current turmoil in the debt markets  as well as perceptions about the future us economy and interest rates  are producing a larger than normal divergence in the perception of value and future relative investment performance of commercial properties 
while we generally believe that such an environment has the potential to produce some exceptional property acquisition opportunities  caution  perspective and disciplined underwriting standards can significantly impact the timing of any future acquisitions 
consequently  our ability to provide a regular stream of real estate investment product necessary to grow our overall investment banking investment services business continues to remain uncertain as begins 
we also continue to rely solely on our in house investment executives to access interested investors who have capital they can afford to place in an illiquid position for an indefinite period of time ie  invest in a sponsored reit 
we continue to evaluate whether our in house sales force is capable  either through our existing client base or through new clients  of raising sufficient investment capital in sponsored reits to achieve future performance objectives 
discontinued operations and property dispositions during the year ended december   we sold no properties 
during the year ended december   we disposed of five office properties 
the five office properties are located in greenville  south carolina  alpharetta  georgia  san diego  california  westford  massachusetts and austin  texas 
during the year ended december   we disposed of one apartment property and five commercial properties 
the apartment property is located in katy  texas 
the five commercial properties are located in santa clara  california  fairfax and herndon  virginia and north andover and peabody  massachusetts 
accordingly  sold properties as of december  are classified as held for sale on our financial statements 
the operating results for these real estate assets have been reflected as discontinued operations in the financial statements for the years ended december  and we continue to evaluate our portfolio  and in the future may decide to dispose of additional properties from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
however  because of the current uncertainty surrounding the valuation levels for real estate and the current uncertainty in the capital and debt markets previously discussed  we do not expect the level of disposition activity to be as significant as it was in and critical accounting policies we have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations  and that require significant management estimates and judgments  are discussed below 
significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts  purchase price allocations  useful lives of fixed assets and the valuation of the derivative 
critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in sponsored reits and our investments in real property 
these policies affect our allocation of purchase prices  allowance for doubtful accounts  assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets  useful lives of fixed assets  valuation of derivatives  classification of leases  and revenue recognition in the syndication of sponsored reits 
allocation of purchase price we have historically allocated the purchase prices of properties to land  buildings and improvements 
each component of purchase price generally has a different useful life 
for properties acquired subsequent to june   the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations  we allocate the value of real estate acquired among land  buildings  improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities  which may consist of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases  and the value of tenant relationships 
purchase price allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on management s estimates 
under some circumstances we may rely upon studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms in determining the purchase price allocations 
purchase price allocated to land and building and improvements is based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets assuming the property was vacant 
management determines the fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
purchase price allocated to above market leases is based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
purchase price allocated to in place leases and tenant relationships is determined as the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships is based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease  however  the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in place lease value because such value and its consequence to amortization expense is immaterial for acquisitions reflected in our financial statements 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include i an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  including real estate taxes  insurance and other operating income and expenses  and ii costs to execute similar leases in current market conditions  such as leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
if future acquisitions result in our allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships  those amounts would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationships 
allowance for bad debts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of a tenant s ability to make future rent payments 
the computation of this allowance is based in part on the tenants payment history and current credit status 
impairment we periodically evaluate our real estate properties for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include declining tenant occupancy  weak or declining tenant profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or legislative  economic or market changes that permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the property by comparing it to its expected future undiscounted cash flows 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations  we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so  or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
depreciation expense we compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
costs incurred in connection with leasing primarily tenant improvements and leasing commissions are capitalized and amortized over the lease period 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
the value of above or below market leases is amortized over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases as an adjustment to rental income 
the value of in place leases  exclusive of the value of above market and below market in place leases  is also amortized over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs  or incorrect estimates of useful lives  could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods  as is required by generally accepted accounting principles 
derivative instruments we recognize derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that do not qualify  or are not designated as hedge relationships  must be adjusted to fair value through income 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
to the extent hedges are effective  a corresponding amount  adjusted for swap payments  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
amounts are then reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
ineffectiveness  if any  is recorded in the income statement 
we periodically review the effectiveness of each hedging transaction  which involves estimating future cash flows  at least quarterly as required by sfas statement no 
 or sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by fasb statement no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities of an amendment of fasb and fasb statement no 
amendment of statement on derivative instrument and hedging activities 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  will be considered fair value hedges under sfas we currently have no fair value hedges outstanding 
fair values of derivatives are subject to significant variability based on changes in interest rates 
the results of such variability could be a significant increase or decrease in our derivative assets  derivative liabilities  book equity  and or earnings 
lease classification some of our real estate properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate whether it is appropriately classified as a capital lease or as an operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a property  discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
revenue recognition we earn syndication and transaction fees in connection with the syndication of sponsored reits 
this revenue is recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate  and statement of position accounting for real estate syndication income 
revenue is recognized provided the criteria for sale accounting in sfas no 
are met 
accordingly  we recognize syndication fees related to commissions when shares of the sponsored reit are sold and the investor s funds have been transferred from escrow into our account 
we recognize transaction fees related to loan commitment and acquisition fees upon an investor closing and the subsequent payment of the sponsored reit s loan and fees payable to us 
other transaction fees are recognized upon the final closing of the syndication of the sponsored reit 
ownership of stock in a sponsored reit common stock investments in sponsored reits are consolidated while the entity is controlled by the company 
following the commencement of syndication the company exercises influence over  but does not control these entities and investments are accounted for using the equity method 
once under the equity method of accounting  our cost basis is adjusted by its share of the sponsored reits earnings  if any  prior to completion of the syndication 
equity in losses or dividends received from sponsored reits generally are recognized as income once the investment balance is reduced to zero  unless there is an asset held for syndication from the sponsored reit entity 
equity in losses or distributions received in excess of investment is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for syndication 
we recognize our share of the operations during the period we consolidate and when the equity method is appropriate  as opposed to classifying the sponsored reits as discontinued operations  because we earn an ongoing asset and or property management fee from sponsored reits 
these ongoing fees  in addition to the influence that we exercise over the sponsored reit  constitute a continuing involvement between the company and the sponsored reit and preclude treatment as discontinued operations 
we currently hold preferred stock interest in two sponsored reits 
as a result of our common stock interest and our preferred stock interest in these two sponsored reits  we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities 
these preferred share investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits operations and distributions received 
we also agreed to vote our preferred shares in any matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these sponsored reits in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of the sponsored reits 
these policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual value  the ability of our tenants to perform their obligations to us  current and future economic conditions and competitive factors in the markets in which our properties are located 
competition  economic conditions and other factors may cause occupancy declines in the future 
in the future we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets

the results of operations for each of the acquired or merged properties are included in our operating results as of their respective purchase or merger dates 
increases in rental revenues and expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   or  the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  are primarily a result of the timing of these acquisitions and subsequent contribution of these acquired properties

we had no sales of real estate in the operating results of the eleven properties sold in and are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented 
investment banking revenue for the investment banking investment services segment is primarily based on the gross proceeds from the sale of securities in the syndications of the sponsored reits 
we completed the syndication of two sponsored reits with total gross proceeds of million in during  we completed one syndication of a sponsored reit and began the process of syndicating another sponsored reit  for which total gross proceeds from both syndications aggregated million in during  we started syndication of another sponsored reit 
total gross proceeds from both syndications aggregated million in and both are currently in process 
we believe the decrease of million in compared to and the decrease of million in compared to were attributable to the recent turmoil in the financial  debt and real estate markets  which is discussed above in trends and uncertainties economic conditions 
revenues and expenses for investment banking investment services are directly related to the gross proceeds of these syndications 
our acquisition executives continue to work on other property investment opportunities for our own portfolio and for syndication 
however  business growth in the syndication area is uncertain at the beginning of the following table shows financial results for the years ended december  and in thousands revenues change rental related party revenue syndication fees transaction fees management fees and interest income from loans other total revenues expenses real estate operating expenses real estate taxes and insurance depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative commissions interest total expenses income before interest income  equity in earnings losses of non consolidated reits and taxes on income interest income equity in earnings losses of non consolidated reits income before taxes on income taxes on income income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations gain on sale of properties  less applicable income tax total discontinued operations net income comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues total revenues decreased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of o a million decrease in syndication and transaction loan commitment fees  which was principally a result of the decrease in gross syndication proceeds for the year ended december  compared to the same period in o a million decrease in interest income from loans  which was principally a result of lower interest income earned from lower average loan balances during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this interest income is derived from mortgage loans on the properties in syndication 
the impact of this decrease was slightly greater as a result of lower interest rates charged during compared to these decreases were partially offset by o an increase to rental revenue of approximately million from real estate arising primarily from the acquisitions of the following properties a property in maryland in june  a property in texas in may  a property in missouri in december and a property in virginia in december expenses total expenses were million for the year ended december   or an increase of million compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of o the increase in real estate operating expenses  real estate taxes and insurance costs of million  and depreciation of million  which were primarily a result of the acquisitions discussed above 
o an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million for the year ended december   which was primarily a result of the cost of new employees hired in the last year  and increases in discretionary bonuses and professional fees

these increases were partially offset by o a decrease in interest expense of million resulting primarily from a lower average loan balance outstanding during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and to a lesser extent lower interest rates in compared to o a decrease in commission expenses of million  which was principally a result of the decrease in gross syndication proceeds for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december interest income interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was primarily a result of a lower interest rates and a lower average balance of cash between and equity in earnings losses of non consolidated reits equity in earnings losses of non consolidated reits increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to losses of million for the year ended december   which was principally a result of income attributed to us from our investment in east wacker

during the year ended december   we received lease termination fee income of  compared to approximately million received from three tenants during the year ended december  o an increase in management fees and interest income from loans of approximately million  which was principally a result of interest income from larger average loan balances during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in for the mortgage loans on the properties in syndication 
the impact of this increase was slightly greater as a result of higher interest rates charged during compared to these increases were partially offset by o a million decrease in syndication and transaction loan commitment fees  which was principally a result of the decrease in gross syndication proceeds for the year ended december  compared to the same period in expenses total expenses were million for the year ended december   or an increase of million compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of o the increase in real estate operating expenses  real estate taxes and insurance costs of million  and depreciation of million  which were primarily a result of the acquisitions and mergers discussed above

we had employees as of december  and at our headquarters in wakefield 
o a decrease in commission expense of million  which was principally a result of the decrease in gross syndication proceeds for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest income interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was primarily a result of a lower average balance of cash  which was partially offset by slightly higher interest rates earned on balances of cash  cash equivalents and other investments between and equity in earnings losses of non consolidated reits equity in earnings losses of non consolidated reits decreased approximately million to losses of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was principally a result of losses attributed to us from the syndications in process during  as compared to income during the year ended december  from syndications and non consolidated investments 
taxes on income total taxes on income remained relatively consistent for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  there was an increase of approximately  in related to a new business tax enacted by the state of texas based on the operations of our properties in texas which was offset by approximately  less taxes primarily due to lower taxable income from the investment banking services 
the decrease in investment banking services in the period compared to was principally a result of a decrease in gross syndication proceeds from compared to during both periods in and  we had an effective tax rate of for our taxable reit subsidiary performing investment banking services 
we expect an effective tax rate of approximately for our taxable reit subsidiary in the future 
income from continuing operations the resulting income from continuing operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  decreased million to million for the reasons discussed above 
discontinued operations and gain on sale of assets during  we sold six properties and classified one property in greenville  south carolina as held for sale  which was sold on january  during  we completed the sale of the property in greenville  south carolina and sold four additional properties 
accordingly  the eleven properties sold are reported as discontinued operations on our financial statements for the relevant periods presented 
income from discontinued operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december  we reported million as gain on sale of assets and for the year ended december  we reported million as net gains on the sale of assets  which are summarized in the tables below dollars in thousands net city property date of sales property address state type sale proceeds gain villa road greenville  sc office january  great oaks way alpharetta  ga office june  goldentop road san diego  ca office june  lyberty way westford  ma office july  taylor draper lane austin  tx office december  settlement of escrows on prior property sales net sales proceeds and gain on sales of real estate in thousands net city property date of sales property address state type sale proceeds gain loss westheimer parkway katy  tx apartment may  patrick henry drive santa clara  ca office may  federal systems park drive fairfax  va office may  one technology drive peabody  ma industrial august  corporate park drive herndon  va office november  andover street turnpike street north andover  ma office december  net sales proceeds and gain on sales of real estate provision for loss on property held for sale villa road greenville  sc office january  net income the resulting net income for the year ended december  was million compared to net income of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
this decrease of million is attributable to million provided by operating activities less million used by investing activities and million used for financing activities 
management believes that existing cash  cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations  cash anticipated to be generated by the sale of preferred stock in future sponsored reits and our existing debt financing will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
although there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary for our future growth  we anticipate generating funds from continuing real estate operations and from fees and commissions from the sale of shares in newly formed sponsored reits 
we believe that we have adequate funds to cover unusual expenses and capital improvements  in addition to normal operating expenses 
our ability to maintain or increase our level of dividends to stockholders  however  depends in significant part upon the level of interest on the part of investors in purchasing shares of sponsored reits and the level of rental income from our real properties 
operating activities the cash provided by our operating activities of million is primarily attributable to net income of million excluding non cash activity  consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of million less straight line rent of million  less equity in income from non consolidated reits of million  plus dividends received from non consolidated reits of million and less payment of deferred leasing commissions of approximately million 
investing activities our cash used by investing activities of million is attributable to uses of million for acquisitions and additions to real estate investments and office equipment  including our acquisition by merger of park ten development on may   a property in missouri on december  and a property in virginia on december   and to a lesser extent tenant improvements and office equipment  a use of approximately million for a loan made to a sponsored reit that is classified in other assets on our balance sheet and a use of million for a deposit on a property that we had under a purchase and sale agreement 
these uses were partially offset by approximately million of proceeds received from the syndications in process with fsp grand boulevard corp 
and fsp interlocken development corp 
financing activities our cash used by financing activities of million is attributable to approximately million of distributions to shareholders plus net repayments on borrowings under our revolver of million and million of deferred financing cost 
these uses were partially offset by fully borrowings our million term loan 
revolver the revolver is with a group of banks for borrowings at our election of up to  and matures on august  borrowings under the revolver bear interest at either the bank s prime rate at december  or a rate equal to libor plus basis points at december  
there were borrowings of  and  at the libor plus basis point rate at a weighted average rate of and outstanding under the revolver at december  and  respectively 
there was no balance outstanding at december  the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding at december  and was approximately and  respectively 
as of december   we were in compliance with all bank covenants under the revolver 
we have drawn on the revolver  and intend to draw on the revolver in the future for a variety of corporate purposes  including the funding of interim mortgage loans to sponsored reits and the acquisition of properties that we acquire directly for our portfolio 
we typically cause mortgage loans to sponsored reits to be secured by a first mortgage against the real property owned by the sponsored reit 
we make these loans to enable a sponsored reit to acquire real property prior to the consummation of the offering of its equity interests  and the loan is repaid out of the offering proceeds 
we also may make secured loans to sponsored reits for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and other costs which would be repaid from long term financing of the property  cash flows from the property or a capital event 
term loan on october   we closed on a  unsecured term loan facility with three banks 
proceeds from the term loan were used to reduce the outstanding principal balance on the revolver 
the term loan has an initial three year term that matures on october  in addition  we have the right to extend the initial maturity date for up to two successive one year periods  or until october  if both extensions are exercised 
we fixed the interest rate for the initial three year term of the term loan at per annum pursuant to an interest rate swap agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all bank covenants under the term loan 
equity securities as of december   we have an automatic shelf registration statement on form s on file with the sec relating to the offer and sale  from time to time  of an indeterminate amount of our common stock 
from time to time  we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock under our automatic shelf registration statement or a different registration statement to fund the acquisition of additional properties  to pay down any existing debt financing and for other corporate purposes 
contingencies from time to time  we may provide financing to sponsored reits in the form of a revolving line of credit secured by a mortgage 
as of december   we were committed to fund up to million to three sponsored reits under such arrangements for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and leasing costs of which  has been drawn and is outstanding 
we anticipate that advances made under these facilities will be repaid at their maturity date or earlier from long term financings of the underlying properties  cash flows from the underlying properties or capital events 
we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur  we believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
assets held for syndication as of december  and  we had one asset held for syndication for a property in kansas city  missouri

advances under the phoenix revolver bear interest at a rate equal to the day libor rate plus basis points and each advance thereunder requires a basis point draw fee

for a discussion of transactions between us and related parties during  see footnote no 
related party transactions to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  other considerations we generally pay the ordinary annual operating expenses of our properties from the rental revenue generated by the properties 
for the years ended december  and  the rental income exceeded the expenses for each individual property  with the exception of a property located in westford  massachusetts  which we sold on july   a property located in federal way  washington and a property located in san jose  california 
the westford  massachusetts property had operating expenses of approximately  for the six and one half month period ending through july  on which date the property was sold 
the property at federal way  washington had a single tenant lease  which expired september  during  we signed leases with two tenants for approximately of the space  which generated rental income of  and had operating expenses of  during the year ended december  during  we signed another tenant to a lease and the three tenants now account for approximately of the space  which generated rental income of  and had operating expenses of  during the year ended december  during  the san jose  california property had one tenant in the building occupying approximately of the rentable square footage of the property 
we had rental income of  during the year ended december  from the tenant in place and the property had operating expenses of  for the year ended december  in december  we signed a lease that commenced in with another tenant for approximately of the rentable square footage of the property 
as a result of the lease signed in december  the property had rental income that exceeded expenses during the year ended december  rental income commitments our commercial real estate operations include the leasing of office buildings and industrial properties subject to leases with terms greater than one year 
the leases thereon expire at various dates through approximate future minimum rental income from non cancelable operating leases as of december  is in thousands year ended december  thereafter contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payment due by period in thousands total revolver term loan operating leases total the operating leases in the table above consist of our lease of corporate office space  which was amended in  expires on july  and has one year renewal option 
the lease includes a base annual rent and additional rent for our share of taxes and operating costs 
from time to time  we may provide financing to sponsored reits in the form of a revolving line of credit secured by a mortgage 
as of december   we were committed to fund up to million to three sponsored reits under such arrangements for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and leasing costs of which  has been drawn and is outstanding 
off balance sheet arrangements investments in sponsored reits as part of our business model we organize single purpose entities that own real estate  purchases of which are financed through the private placement of equity in those entities  typically through syndication 
we call these entities sponsored reits  and they are operated in a manner intended to qualify as real estate investment trusts 
we earn fees related to the sale of preferred stock in the sponsored reits in these syndications 
the sponsored reits issue both common stock and preferred stock 
the common stock is owned solely by fsp corp 
generally the preferred stock is owned by unaffiliated investors  however  we acquired an interest in preferred shares of four sponsored reits 
in addition  directors and officers of fsp corp  have from time to time invested in sponsored reits and may do so again in the future 
following consummation of the offerings  the preferred stockholders in each of the sponsored reits are entitled to of the sponsored reit s cash distributions 
subsequent to the completion of the offering of preferred shares  except for the preferred stock we own  we do not share in any of the sponsored reit s earnings  or any related dividend  and the common stock ownership interests have virtually no economic benefit or risk 
prior to the completion of the offering of preferred shares  we share in a sponsored reit s earnings and related dividends to the extent of our ownership interest in the sponsored reit 
as a common stockholder  upon completion of the syndication  we have no rights to the sponsored reit s earnings or any related cash distributions 
however  upon liquidation of a sponsored reit  we are entitled to our percentage interest as a common stockholder in any proceeds remaining after the preferred stockholders have recovered their investment 
our percentage interest in each sponsored reit is less than 
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the sponsored reit s preferred stockholders is required for any actions involving merger  sale of property  amendment to charter or issuance of additional capital stock 
in addition  all of the sponsored reits allow the holders of more than of the outstanding preferred shares to remove without cause and replace one or more members of that sponsored reit s board of directors 
common stock investments in sponsored reits are consolidated while the entity is controlled by us 
following the commencement of syndication we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities and investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting  the cost basis is increased by its share of the sponsored reits earnings  if any  prior to completion of the syndication 
equity in losses of sponsored reits is not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would become negative and distributions received are recognized as income once the investment balance is reduced to zero  unless there are assets held for syndication from the sponsored reit entity 
equity in losses or distributions received in excess of investment is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for syndication 
we have acquired a preferred stock interest in four sponsored reits  including one that the company acquired by merger on april   which was accounted for as a purchase  and the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair value  and  another that we acquired on may  by cash merger 
as a result of our common stock interest and our preferred stock interest in the remaining two sponsored reits  we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities 
these preferred share investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits operations and distributions received 
we also agreed to vote our preferred shares in any matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these sponsored reits in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of the sponsored reits 
at december   we held a common stock interest in sponsored reits  of which were fully syndicated and from which we no longer share economic benefit or risk 
the two that were not fully syndicated at december  include one that commenced in september  and another that commenced in june the value of the entities that were not fully syndicated was approximately million and was shown on the consolidated balance sheets as assets held for syndication 
at december   we held a common stock interest in sponsored reits  of which were fully syndicated and from which we no longer share economic benefit or risk 
one syndication commenced in september and was not completed by december  the value of the entity that was not fully syndicated was approximately million and was shown on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset held for syndication 
at december   we held a common stock interest in ten sponsored reits  nine of which were fully syndicated  and one was substantially syndicated  from which we no longer share economic benefit or risk 
the table below shows our income and expenses from sponsored reits

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our floating rate borrowing arrangements 
we use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december  and  if market rates on borrowings under our revolver increased by at maturity  or approximately and basis points  respectively  over the current variable rate  the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by million and million annually 
the interest rate on our revolver as of december  was libor plus basis points 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by borrowings under our revolver is material as of december  our term loan of million bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus basis points  with a floor on libor  which was fixed at annum for its initial three year term with an interest rate swap agreement  and therefore  the fair value of this instrument is affected by changes in market interest rates 
we believe that we have mitigated interest rate risk with respect to the term loan through the interest rate swap agreement for the initial three year term of the loan 
this interest rate swap agreement was our only derivative instrument as of december  the term loan has an initial three year term that matures on october  in addition  we have the right to extend the initial maturity date for up to two successive one year periods  or until october  if both extensions are exercised 
upon maturity  our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments will be dependent upon the balance then outstanding and prevalent market interest rates 
the table below lists our derivative instrument  which is hedging variable cash flows related to interest on our term loan as of december  in thousands asset hedged benchmark rate notional value strike rate effective date expiration date fair value interest rate swap term loan libor our term loan hedging transaction used a derivative instrument that involves certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparty to our derivative arrangement is rbs citizens  na  which has a senior unsecured debt credit rating of aa by moody s 
as a result  we do not anticipate that the counterparty will fail to meet its obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or that will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
the revolver matures in august and has a variable rate of interest 
upon maturity  our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments will be dependent upon the balance then outstanding and prevalent market interest rates 
we borrow from time to time under the revolver 
these borrowings bear interest at the bank s base rate at december  or a day libor plus basis points at december   as elected by us when requesting funds 
generally the borrowings are for day libor plus basis points 
there were borrowings totaling  and  in the aggregate at the day libor plus basis point rate  representing a weighted average rate of and outstanding under the revolver at december  and  respectively 
we have drawn on the revolver  and intend to draw on the revolver in the future for a variety of corporate purposes  including the funding of interim mortgage loans to sponsored reits and the acquisition of properties that we acquire directly for our portfolio 
generally interim mortgage loans bear interest at the same variable rate payable by us under our line of credit 
we also may draw on the revolver to fund advances we may make under three revolving line of credit facilities we made with sponsored reits 
in december  we entered into a three year secured promissory note for a revolving line of credit  which we refer to as the phoenix revolver  for up to million with an entity that is wholly owned by one of our sponsored reits  fsp phoenix tower corp  of which million was drawn in january and is outstanding 
advances under the phoenix revolver bear interest at a rate equal to the day libor rate plus basis points and each advance thereunder requires a basis point draw fee 
in december  we also entered into a three year secured promissory note for a revolving line of credit  which we refer to as the waterford revolver  for up to million with a sponsored reit  fsp waterford corp  which is available but has not been drawn on 
advances under the waterford revolver bear interest at a rate equal to the day libor rate plus basis points and each advance thereunder requires a basis point draw fee 
in december  we entered into a three year secured promissory note for a revolving line of credit  which we refer to as the highland revolver for up to million to a sponsored reit  fsp highland place i corp  of which  has been drawn and is outstanding 
advances under the highland revolver bear interest at a rate equal to the day libor rate plus basis points 
we therefore believe that we have mitigated our interest rate risk with respect to our borrowings that are used to make loans to our sponsored reits  including the phoenix revolver  the waterford revolver and the highland revolver 
the phoenix revolver  the waterford revolver and the highland revolver were made to fund capital expenditures  costs of leasing and for other purposes and each is secured by a mortgage on the underlying property 
we anticipate that any advances made will be repaid at their maturity or earlier from long term financings of the underlying properties  cash flows from the underlying properties or capital events 
historically we have satisfied borrowings under our revolver that are used to make loans to our sponsored reits from cash or the sale of properties in our portfolio 
the following table presents as of december  our contractual variable rate borrowings under our revolver  which matures on august  and under our term loan  which matures on october  under the term loan we have the right to extend the initial maturity date for up to two successive one year periods  or until october  if both extensions are exercised payment due by period in thousands total revolver term loan total
