the company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason  except as required by law 
overview we design  develop and market integrated circuits  or ics  for digital media applications  such as digital television  or dtv  liquid crystal display television  or lcd tv 
our system on a chip  or soc  semiconductors provide the intelligence for these new types of displays by processing and optimizing video and computer graphic signals to produce high quality and realistic images 
our discrete products include frame rate converter  or frc  demodulator  or drx and audio decoder products 
many of the world s leading manufacturers of consumer electronics and computer display products utilize our technology to enhance image quality and ease of use of their products 
our goal is to provide the best image quality enhanced digital media integrated circuits at competitive prices to our customers 
since we have designed  developed and marketed very large scale ics for graphics applications  historically for the personal computer  or pc  market  and since for digital tv  or dtv  in the consumer television market 
business structure since june  when we announced a restructuring of our business to divest our legacy graphics business  we have focused our business primarily in the high definition television  or hdtv  market and related areas 
in a separate transaction completed in june  we merged our digital media segment with trident technologies  inc  or tti  a taiwanese company that was owned by trident at june   and  in order to strengthen and extend our dtv business 
tti had previously operated primarily as a taiwan based semiconductor design house developing video processing technologies useful for digital media applications 
since september   we have conducted this business primarily through our cayman islands subsidiary  trident microsystems far east ltd  or tmfe 
research and development services relating to existing projects and certain new projects are conducted by trident microsystems  inc and our subsidiaries  trident multimedia technologies shanghai co 
ltd  or tmt  and trident microsystems beijing co  ltd  or tmbj 
tmbj was previously a privately held company known as beijing tiside electronics design co  ltd  or tiside  which we acquired in march and subsequently renamed as tmbj 
operations and field application engineering support and certain sales activities are conducted through our taiwanese subsidiaries  trident microelectronics co 
ltd  or tml  and trident microsystems taiwan ltd  or tmtw  and other affiliates 
in fiscal year ended june   we established a new subsidiary in south korea  trident microsystems korea limited  or tmk  to primarily provide sales liaison and marketing services in south korea and a new subsidiary in hong kong  trident microsystems hong kong ltd  or tmhk  to handle sales and inventory distribution for the entire company 
trident multimedia systems  inc  or tms  was inactive at june  tti was liquidated as of june  during the third quarter of fiscal year ended june   we evaluated the viability of our set top box  or stb  business in china  including stb products under development by tmbj and determined that continuing this business was not directly aligned with our core strategy of pursuing dtv market opportunities 
accordingly  we decided not to allocate resources to the stb business concurrent with the acquisition of certain product lines from micronas 
instead  we determined to utilize these resources to further penetrate and develop the soc market 
references to we  our  trident or the company in this report refer to trident microsystems  inc and our subsidiaries  including tmbj  tmk  tmfe  tml  tmt  tmhk  tmeu  tmnm  tms  tmtw and tti 

table of contents business combination on may   we completed our acquisition of the selected assets of frc  drx  and audio decoder product lines from micronas semiconductor holding ag  or micronas  a swiss corporation 
in may  in connection with this acquisition  we issued million shares of our common stock and warrant to acquire up to million additional shares of our common stock  with a fair value of approximately million and incurred approximately million of acquisition related transaction costs and liabilities  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
in connection with this acquisition  we established three new subsidiaries in europe trident microsystems europe gmbh  or tmeu  trident microsystems nederland bv  or tmnm  and trident microsystems holding bv  or tmh 
the purpose of these entities is primarily to provide sales liaison  marketing and engineering services in europe 
tmeu is located in munich  germany and tmnm and tmh are located in the netherlands 
net revenues our net revenues are generated by sales of our discrete and soc products 
we sell our products primarily to digital television original equipment manufacturers  or oems  in japan  south korea  asia pacific and europe  either directly or through their supplier channels 
we consider these oems to be our customers and historically  significant portions of our revenues have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of customers 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on the design wins of our products  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry  current general economic volatility  conditions in the semiconductor industry  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  and the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory 
from time to time  our key customers may cancel purchase orders from us  thereby causing our quarterly net revenues to fluctuate significantly 
we expect that these fluctuations could continue due to the uncertainty in the current economic environment 
our products are manufactured primarily by two foundries including united microelectronics corporation  or umc  based in taiwan and micronas  based in germany 
in fiscal year ended june  we maintained our leadership position in discrete video but we were missing certain technologies necessary to compete effectively at the soc level 
as a result  we did not have significant soc design wins at tier i oems to sustain revenues in fiscal year ended june  we strongly believe that our recently completed acquisition of three product lines of the consumer division from micronas provides complementary features and technologies that are critical to our soc strategy 
we now have significant technology advantages in audio decoder and demodulator products in particular 
with this investment  we also demonstrate to our customers that we are committed to this market and we demonstrate to ourselves that we can quickly and efficiently integrate a substantial acquisition 
this gives us increased confidence as we look to the next opportunities for trident 
the following table shows the percentage of our revenues during the years ended june    and that was derived from customers who individually accounted for more than of revenues in that year revenue midoriya supplier to sony sharp philips samsung less than revenue 
the dtv market is very concentrated 
the three largest japanese oems together currently comprise approximately of our revenues 
we have roughly of our revenues controlled by four customers and of the revenues controlled by the top seven 
see note segment and geographic information and major customers  of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part ii  item of this report 
all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars and euros 

table of contents gross margin our gross margin has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix and volume of product sales  the effects of competitive pricing programs and rebates  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies  fluctuations in direct product costs such as wafer pricing and assembly  packaging and testing costs and overhead costs  product warranty costs  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventories acquisition strategy an element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings  augment our engineering workforce  and enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including acquisitions and other business combination transactions  strategic relationships and the purchase or sale of assets 
see note business combination  of notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to the acquisitions made in  and in fiscal years ended june  and  we completed two acquisitions for total equity consideration of million and total cash consideration of million  respectively  which are as follows in fiscal year ended june   we acquired the selected assets of the frc  drx and audio decoder product lines of the consumer division of micronas  a competitor of trident  which enables us to increase our market shares in the dtv market 
in fiscal year ended june   we acquired a ownership interest in tiside  a privately held software company located in china  which designs cross platform software that allows multimedia applications to run on devices in the digital living room such as set top boxes or dtv sets 
segments we operate in one reportable operating segment  digital medial solutions 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas  establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
sfas also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
our chief executive officer  who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker  reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates include revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns  stock based compensation expense  goodwill and purchased intangible assets  valuation of equity investments in privately held companies and funds  inventories  fair value measurements  product warranty  income taxes  litigation and other loss contingencies and business combinations 
such accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
for a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business  also see risk factors in item a 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive offerings and sales returns allowance in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
our customer incentive offerings primarily involve volume rebates for our products in various target markets 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
a sales returns allowance is established based primarily on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors at that time 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing protection and or rights of return 
product revenues on sales made to distributors which contain such rights of return and price protection are deferred and only recognized when these rights expire or upon sale and shipment to the end user customers 
allowance for sales returns we maintain a sales returns allowance for estimated product returns based primarily on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors at that time 
if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates  we may determine that additional sales returns allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 
stock based compensation expense we account for share based payments  including grants of stock options and awards to employees and directors  in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment or sfas r  which requires that share based payments be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values and the estimated number of shares we ultimately expect will vest 
in addition  we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period of all stock options and awards other than the performance based restricted stock award with market conditions that was granted to our chief executive officer under the plan 
for purposes of expensing this single performance based grant  we elected to use the accelerated method 
we record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive the tax deduction 
we value our stock based payment awards and warrants granted using the black scholes model  except for the performance based restricted stock award with market conditions granted under the plan during the second quarter of fiscal year ended june   for which we elected to use a monte carlo valuation methodology to value the award 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the black scholes model requires the input of certain assumptions 
trident s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
the expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to exercise and post vesting cancellations of options by employees 
upon the adoption of sfas r  we continued to use historical volatility in deriving our expected volatility assumption as allowed under sfas r and sab because we believe that future volatility over the expected term of the stock options is not likely to differ materially from the past 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of our stock options 
the expected dividend assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
for the fiscal years ended june    and  stock based compensation expense  before income taxes  was million  million  and million  respectively  which consisted primarily of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and awards recognized under sfas r 

table of contents goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill impairment assessment we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  or sfas with respect to goodwill  factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset or a significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  control premiums  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals  and industry trends 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our net income loss 
goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
sfas requires a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit which carries goodwill 
sfas requires that the impairment test be performed at least annually by applying a fair value based test 
the first step measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit which carries goodwill 
to determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions 
these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment 
our estimates for market growth  our market share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
if future forecasts are revised  impairment charges may be required 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
long lived assets impairment assessment management evaluates the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  which generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists 
we considered certain events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets may not be recoverable including  but are not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time  and changes in our business strategy 
in determining if an impairment exists  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
if an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
valuation of equity investments in privately held companies and funds we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies and funds  which we account for using the cost method  for business and strategic purposes 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an ability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the recorded value of our equity investments in privately held companies in our consolidated balance sheet as of june  is million 
inventories inventories are computed using the lower of cost or market  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
inventory components are work in process and finished goods 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
when we introduce new products that are designed to enhance or replace our older products  we typically provide inventory reserves on our older products based on the expected timing and volume of customer purchases of the new product over a six month period 
the timing and volume of the new product introductions can be impacted significantly by events out of our control including changes in customer product introduction schedules 
accordingly  we may end up selling more of our older fully reserved product until the customer is able to execute on his change over plan 

table of contents fair value measurements we evaluated the estimated fair value of financial instruments by applying the provisions of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements or sfas the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these items 
product warranty our products are generally subject to warranty  which provides for the estimated future costs of repair  replacement or customer accommodation upon revenue recognition in the accompanying statements of operations 
the warranty accrual is calculated based on the actual claims claimed by the customers 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized by using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we also have to assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
if realization is not likely  we are required to increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate we will not ultimately realize 
we believe that we will not ultimately realize a substantial amount of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would decrease in the period in which we determined that the realization is probable 
in addition  we adopted financial accounting standards board or fasb interpretation  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
or fin  and related guidance on july  under fin  we are required to make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
because we are required to determine the probability of various possible outcomes  such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this re evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances and changes in tax law 
a change in recognition or measurement would result either in the recognition of a tax benefit or in an additional charge to the tax provision for the period 
litigation and other loss contingencies we account for litigation and other loss contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual losses from loss contingencies are significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be materially affected 
we have been required to make such adjustments to these types of estimates in the past 
business combinations we estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these might have a significant effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives 
furthermore  a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill  which is an asset that is not amortized 
often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset  the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in process technology 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements

comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  digital media product revenues decreased by million in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  in fiscal year ended june   total svp revenues decreased by million  while soc revenues decreased by million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased revenues of million resulting from the sale of frc  demodulator and audio decoder products that were acquired from micronas following the acquisition which closed on may  our unit sales volume of digital media products decreased by in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  and the year over year average selling prices of these products decreased by approximately 

table of contents during the fiscal year ended june   net revenues decreased in all regions 
revenues in south korea decreased significantly primarily due to a major south korean customer shifting its strategy to design and produce portions of its silicon products internally rather than outsourcing the design to a third party vendor 
revenues in japan and europe decreased primarily due to the absence of major design wins for our soc products at tier one customers and lower revenues generated from our existing products that are going to be phased out of production 
revenues in asia pacific decreased primarily due to the continued decrease in sales of svp products and intense price competition in the market where we sell discrete image process controllers 
overall  the revenue decline in fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to decreased sales of our legacy svp products  the loss of design win opportunities relating to our new soc products  and to a lesser extent  due to the global economic downturn 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  digital media product revenues decreased million in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  in fiscal year ended june   total svp revenues decreased by million  while soc revenues increased by million 
our unit sales volume of digital media products increased by in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  and the year over year average selling prices of these products decreased by approximately 
the decrease in digital media product revenues was primarily due to i the delay in the introduction of our soc products to a korean oem  ii aggressive competition in china s dtv market  and iii shorter life cycles for newer svp products compared to the older versions and iv the slower transition from our svp to soc products in the second half of fiscal year ended june  during fiscal year ended june   net revenues decreased in most regions  particularly in south korea and asia pacific  except europe 
revenues in south korea decreased primarily due to the delayed introduction of our soc products 
asia pacific revenues decreased primarily due to the decreased sales of svp products and competition from the discrete image process controller market 
however  revenues in europe  our fastest growing region  more than doubled and increased by million in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in sales of certain svp products sold to a major european oem customer 
gross margin fiscal years ended june  dollars in thousands change change gross profit gross margin cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing wafers manufactured by an independent foundry  costs associated with our purchase of assembly  test and quality assurance services  royalties  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  operation support expenses that consist primarily of personnel related expenses including payroll  stock based compensation expenses  and manufacturing costs related principally to the mass production of our products  tester equipment rental and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 
gross margin is calculated as net revenues less cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenue 
gross margin has continued to be impacted by our product mix and volume of product sales  including sales to high volume customers  royalties  competitive pricing programs  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  and cost associated with operational support 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june   principally as a result of i significantly lower revenues that did not offer the economies of scale needed to cover fixed manufacturing support costs  ii a weaker product mix of svp and soc products  iii write down of acquisition related intangible assets  and iv an increase in intangible assets amortization as a percentage of decreasing revenues 

table of contents the net impact on gross profit of the additions to inventory reserves and sales of previously reserved products is as follow fiscal years ended june  dollars in thousands additions to inventory reserves sales of previously reserved products net increase in gross profit in fiscal year ended june   as shown in the table above  revenues from the sale of previously reserved products were million or of total net revenues 
due to the previously recorded reserves  there was no cost of revenues reflected with respect to these product sales  which in effect  provided a benefit to the current income statement to the extent of the selling price 
concurrently  we recorded additional inventory reserves for fiscal year ended june  in the amount of approximately million 
sales of previously reserved inventory largely depend on the timing of transitions to newer generations of similar products 
when we introduce new products that are designed to enhance or replace our older products  we typically provide inventory reserves on our older products based on the expected timing and volume of customer purchases of the new product 
the timing and volume of the new product introductions can be significantly affected by events out of our control  including changes in customer product introduction schedules 
accordingly  we may end up selling more of our older fully reserved product until the customer is able to execute on its changeover plan 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  gross margin has continued to be impacted by our product mix and volume of product sales  including sales to high volume customers  royalties  competitive pricing programs  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  and cost associated with operational support 
gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june   principally as a result of i the blended average selling price for our svp product line decreasing at a faster rate than our unit cost and ii a product shift to a more complex technology content  such as me mc feature  which has a higher royalty unit fee  partially offset by iii a decrease in amortization of intangible assets 
research and development fiscal years ended june  dollars in thousands change change research and development as a percentage of net revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses including payroll expenses  stock based compensation  engineering costs related principally to the design of our new products and depreciation of property and equipment 
because the number of new designs we release to our third party foundries can fluctuate from period to period  research  development and related expenses may fluctuate significantly 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in fiscal year ended june  as we are currently planning to continue the development of our next generation soc and discrete products as well as enhancements to our existing products 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased significantly from fiscal year to fiscal year due primarily to the significant decrease in revenues in fiscal year the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to i a million increase in third party ip licenses  ii a million increase in employee related expenses associated with increased employee headcount in connection with the acquisition in may and iii million third party ip impairment write off due to a change in business strategy and a change in business use of assets associated with the acquisition  offset by iv a million decrease in stock based compensation expense principally due to certain option modifications and contingent liabilities associated with vested options of certain terminated employees that occurred only during the fiscal year ended june   v a million decrease in new product development expenditures was attributable to a million reversal of software license fee adjustment for prior software usage during the fiscal year ended june   and vi a million decrease from lower mask tooling fees due to decrease in production 
for the detail of the third party ip impairment analysis and prior years software usage  refer to note  goodwill and intangible assets and note  commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for detail  respectively 

table of contents comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  was primarily the result of i a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with increased employee headcount in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june   ii a million increase in stock based compensation expense recognized in accordance with sfas no 
r  iii a million increase in depreciation expense due to the completion of our research and development center in shanghai  china in september  and iv a million increase in new product development expenditures 
the million increase in new product development expenditures was attributable to a million software license fee adjustment for prior software usage and an additional million representing increased engineering expenses related to the new product development 
selling  general and administrative fiscal years ended june  dollars in thousands change change selling  general and administrative as a percentage of net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses including stock based compensation  commissions paid to sales representatives and distributors and professional fees 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased significantly from fiscal year to fiscal year due primarily to the significant decrease in revenues in fiscal year the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june   resulted primarily from i a million decrease in stock based compensation expense primarily related to the extension of the option exercise period and contingent liabilities associated with vested options of certain terminated employees that occurred only in fiscal year ended june   ii a million decrease in sales commission paid to distributors representatives due to the decreased product sales in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june   iii a million decrease in legal and professional fees due to the completion of our investigation into our stock option granting process in september  partially offset by iv a million increase in salary and payroll related expense associated with increased employee headcount in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  and v a million increase in consulting fees 
during the fiscal year ended june   we capitalized approximately million of legal and professional fees related to due diligence in connection with the acquisition of micronas in accordance with sfas revised  business combination  or sfas we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will slightly increase in fiscal year ended june  comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june   resulted principally from i an additional million stock based compensation expense primarily related to the extension of stock option exercise periods and contingent liabilities associated with vested options of certain terminated employees  ii a million increase in consulting fees primarily due to the hiring of an outside consulting firm to review our operating and sales functions during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended june   iii a million increase in salaries associated with increased employee headcount compared to fiscal year ended june   partially offset by iv a million decrease in professional fees and v a million decrease in commissions paid to distributors representatives associated with decreased revenues 
the primary reason for the decrease in professional fees was the september completion of our investigation into our stock option granting practices

income taxes payable decreased because of i the significant decrease in pre tax income during the second half of fiscal year ended june  and ii the relative strengthening of the us dollar in fiscal year ended june  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to lower net income  larger decreases in accounts payable  and accrued expenses and other liabilities  largely offset by larger decreases in accounts receivable  inventories and non cash stock based compensation expense

table of contents liquidity our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which result from the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties and conditions in asia and the global economy 
although the majority of our cash  cash equivalents and investments is held outside the united states  and therefore might be subjected to the factors described above  we believe our current resources are sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
we will consider transactions to finance our activities  including debt and equity offerings and new credit facilities or other financing transactions  as needed in the future 
we believe our current cash and cash equivalents are adequate 
days sales outstanding trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding were days as of june  compared to days as of june  the increase in dso was primarily due to significantly more customers receiving credit terms when these new customers were acquired through the acquisition 
currently the credit terms of the new customers are between net and days compared to the prepayment and net days credit terms granted to the new customers in prior years

as of june   the long term income taxes payable under fin was million 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes

lin et al  no 
cv plaintiffs in all cases allege that certain of our current or former officers and directors caused it to grant options at less than fair market value  contrary to our public statements including our financial statements  and that as a result those officers and directors are liable to us 
no particular amount of damages has been alleged  and by the nature of the lawsuit no damages will be alleged against us 
the board of directors has appointed a special litigation committee slc  composed solely of independent directors  to review and manage any claims that we may have relating to the stock option grant practices investigated by the slc 
the scope of the slc s authority includes the claims asserted in the derivative actions 
in federal court  trident has moved to stay the case pending the assessment by the slc that was formed to consider nominal plaintiffs claims 
in state court  trident moved to stay the case in deference to the federal lawsuit  and the parties have agreed  with the court s approval  to take that motion off of the court s calendar to await the assessment of the slc 
based on our review and assessment  the slc has recommended certain settlements with certain of the defendants and intends to seek approval of such settlements from the federal court 
we cannot predict whether these actions are likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to  trident 
we expect to continue to incur legal fees in responding to these lawsuits  including expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of present and former officers and directors under indemnification obligations 
regulatory actions we are subject to a formal investigation by the sec in connection with our investigation into our stock option granting practices and related issues 
although the doj commenced an investigation relating to the same issues  the doj has not requested information from us since february  we have been cooperating with  and continue to cooperate with  inquiries from the sec and doj investigations 
in addition  we have received an inquiry from the internal revenue service to which we have responded 
we are unable to predict what consequences  if any  that an investigation by any regulatory agency may have 
any regulatory investigation could result in our business being adversely impacted 
special litigation committee effective at the close of trading on september   we temporarily suspended the ability of optionees to exercise vested options to purchase shares of our common stock  until we became current in the filing of our periodic reports with the sec and filed a registration statement on form s for the shares issuable under the plan  or plan s this suspension continued in effect through august   the date of the filing of the plan s  which followed our filing  on august   of our quarterly reports on form q for the periods ended september   december  and march  as a result  we extended the exercise period of approximately  fully vested options held by employees  who were terminated during the suspension period  giving them either days or days after we became current in the filings of our periodic reports with the sec and filed the plan s in order to exercise their vested options 
during the three months ended september   eight of these ten former employees stated above exercised all of their vested options 
however  on september   the slc decided that it was in the best interests of our stockholders not to allow the remaining two former employees  as well as our former ceo and two former non employee directors  to exercise their vested options during the pendency of the slc s proceedings  and extended  until march   the period during which these five former employees could exercise approximately  of their fully vested options 
moreover  the slc allowed one former employee to exercise all of his fully vested stock options and another former employee agreed to cancel all of such individual s fully vested stock options during the three months ended march  on january   the slc extended  until august   the period during which the two former non employee directors could exercise their unexpired vested options 
on march   the slc entered into an agreement with our former ceo allowing him to exercise all of his fully vested stock options 
under this agreement  he agreed that any shares obtained through these exercises or net proceeds obtained through the sale of such shares would be placed in an identified securities brokerage account and not withdrawn  transferred or otherwise removed without either i a court order granting him permission to do so or ii the written permission of us 
on may   the slc permitted one of our former non employee directors to exercise his fully vested stock and entered into an agreement with the other former non employee director on terms similar to the agreement entered into with our former ceo  allowing him to exercise all of his fully vested stock options 
because trident s stock price as of june  was lower than the prices at which our former ceo and each of the two former non employee directors had desired to exercise their options  as indicated in previous written notices to the slc  we recorded a contingent liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  totaling million  which was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of june  and the related expenses were included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year then ended 
as the slc investigation is still in progress  we believe that our former ceo  two former non employee directors and two former employees may seek compensation from us relating to the exercise of their fully vested stock options  therefore  a million contingent liability remained in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of june  
table of contents indemnification obligations we indemnify  as permitted under delaware law and in accordance with our bylaws  our officers  directors and members of our senior management for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while they were serving at our request in such capacity 
in this regard  we have received  or expect to receive  requests for indemnification by certain current and former officers  directors and employees in connection with our investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and related issues  and the related governmental inquiries and shareholder derivative litigation 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unknown and potentially unlimited  therefore  it cannot be estimated 
we have directors and officers liability insurance policies that may enable us to recover a portion of such future indemnification claims paid  subject to coverage limitations of the policies  and plan to make claim for reimbursement from our insurers of any potentially covered future indemnification payments 
prior software usage during april  as a result of an internal review that we conducted  we determined that our use of certain third party software in prior periods exceeded the levels of usage authorized under license agreements in effect for such periods 
during the year  we negotiated new license agreements with the vendors in order to obtain the rights and authorizations necessary to meet our software usage requirements 
during the year ended june   we determined that contracts had been negotiated with our software vendors to cover all of our current usage requirements 
we are current with all licenses  and it is no longer probable that we would be expected to pay for the past usage 
as a result of this determination  during the fiscal year ended june   we recorded a credit of million to research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
we currently have no remaining accrual associated with the issue on prior software usage 
general from time to time  we are involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business 
for example  we are currently defending a patent infringement lawsuit brought by gregory bender  an individual  in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the lone patent asserted by mr 
bender has expired 
we believe that mr 
bender s claim for past infringement lacks merit and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit 
while we cannot be certain about the ultimate outcome of any litigation  management does not believe any pending legal proceeding will result in a judgment or settlement that will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operation or cash flows

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to three primary types of market risks foreign currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk and investment risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we currently have operations in the united states  taiwan  china  hong kong  germany  the netherlands  japan  singapore and south korea 
the functional currency of all of our operations is the us dollar 
approximately million  or of our cash and cash equivalents  are held outside the united states  a majority of which is denominated in us dollars 
in addition  income tax payable in foreign jurisdictions is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
although personnel and facilities related expenses are primarily incurred in local currencies due to the location of our subsidiaries outside the united states  substantially all of our other expenses are incurred in us dollars 
since we acquired certain product lines from micronas in may  we have also incurred some manufacturing and related expenses in euros 
while we expect our international revenues to continue to be denominated primarily in us dollars  an increasing portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies  such as euros 
in addition  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in foreign currency exchange rates of certain currencies relative to the us dollar 
we analyze our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations  however  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future 
since we have research and development facilities in shanghai and beijing  china  munich and freiburg  germany  nijmegen  the netherlands and sales liaison offices in shanghai  beijing  shenzhen  china  singapore  and south korea  a large percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  foreign currency exchange rate volatility  particularly in euros and china s currency  renminbi  could negatively or positively affect our operating costs in the future 
interest rate risk we currently maintain our cash equivalents primarily in certificates of deposit  u 
s treasury bills  and other highly liquid investments 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of june   we have approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  of which million is cash  million is invested in certificates of deposit  and million is invested in u 
s treasury bills 
we currently intend to continue investing a significant portion of our existing cash equivalents in interest bearing  investment grade securities  with maturities of less than three months 
we do not believe that our investments  in the aggregate  have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
however  we will continue to monitor the health of the financial institutions with which these investments and deposits have been made due to the current global financial environment 
investment risk investment in privately held companies and funds we are exposed to changes in the value of our investments in privately held companies and funds  including privately held start up companies 
long term equity investments in technology companies are primarily carried at cost 
however  the carrying values of these long term equity investments could be impaired due to the volatility of the industries in which these companies participate and other factors such as the continuing deterioration of macroeconomic conditions 
we will continue to evaluate the financial status of these investments as well as monitor the status of the investments which are held by any underlying venture capital funds 
the balance of our long term equity investments in privately held companies was approximately million  which is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of june
