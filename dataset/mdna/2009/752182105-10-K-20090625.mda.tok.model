the following md a is written to help the reader understand our company 
the md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying financial statement notes of the company appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  cautionary note regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties  including statements regarding our strategic direction  prospects and future results 
certain factors  including factors outside of our control  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update or revise such forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after such statements are made 
such uncertainties include  among others  the following factors overview business rand logistics  inc formerly rand acquisition corporation was incorporated in the state of delaware on june  as a blank check company to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of lower lakes towing ltd  a canadian corporation which  with its subsidiary lower lakes transportation company  provides bulk freight shipping services throughout the great lakes region 
as part of the acquisition of lower lakes  we also acquired lower lakes affiliate  grand river navigation company  inc prior to the acquisition  we did not conduct  or have any investment in  any operating business 
in this discussion of rand s business  unless the context otherwise requires  references to rand include rand and its direct and indirect subsidiaries  and references to lower lakes business or the business of lower lakes mean the combined businesses of lower lakes towing  lower lakes transportation and grand river 
rand s shipping business is operated in canada by lower lakes towing and in the united states by lower lakes transportation 
lower lakes towing was organized in march under the laws of canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports in the great lakes that were restricted in their ability to receive larger vessels 
lower lakes has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full service shipping company with a fleet of thirteen cargo carrying vessels  including one vessel is operated under a contract of affreightment 
from its exclusively canadian beginnings  lower lakes has also grown to offer domestic services to both canadian and us customers as well as cross border routes 
lower lakes services the construction  electric utility and integrated steel industries through the transportation of limestone  coal  iron ore  salt  grain and other dry bulk commodities 
we believe that lower lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port to port services to both canada and the united states in the great lakes region 
lower lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both us and canadian flagged vessels in compliance with the shipping act   and the merchant marine act   commonly referred to as the jones act  in the us and the coasting trade act canada in canada 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  the fiscal year ended march  was highlighted by several significant events we operated the three former wms time chartered vessels that we acquired on february  for a total of sailing days  which we define as days a vessel is crewed and available for sailing  during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   these three vessels sailed only days due to a strike by wms s licensed officers 
we operated the two former voyageur vessels for a total of sailing days during the fiscal year ended march   compared to only sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  we retired and scrapped our oldest and smallest vessel at the end of the sailing season  and accordingly did not operate such vessel during the fiscal year ended march  we operated this vessel sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  due to the repowering and other upgrading of the saginaw  we operated this vessel only sailing days during the fiscal year ended march   compared to sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  excluding the saginaw  we operated the remaining canadian and us core vessels that lower lakes owned or operated at the time of our march  acquisition for fewer sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily the result of reduced operations in the three month period ended march  due to the impact of a weaker economy 
we benefited from improved freight rates on new and renewed contracts  as well as contractual rate increases from existing contracts 
until december  we benefited from improved vessel utilization realized from greater scheduling flexibility and increased backhaul opportunities available to our larger fleet  which allowed us to increase the percentage of time that the company s vessels were loaded 
consequently  we moved significantly more cargo during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  all of our customer contracts have fuel surcharge provisions whereby the increases in our fuel costs are passed on to customers 
such increases in fuel surcharges impact our margin percentages  but do not reduce our margin dollars 
due to the weakened economy  we experienced a significant slowdown from our aggregates and iron ore customers commencing in december  as quarries were closed early for the winter and iron ore shipments to our major steel manufacturing customer were suspended 
much of our aggregate and steel customer s tonnage is carried in north to south trips  however  commencing in december   we were required to continue to meet customer contractual commitments for our backhaul customers usually south to north who remained open before the winter freeze and scheduled lock closures 
accordingly  the remaining vessels operated through the end of the sailing season but were unable to maintain scheduling and operating efficiencies 
the canadian dollar weakened by approximately versus the us dollar at march  as compared to march  however  as a result of the timing of our great lakes season  canadian revenues and costs were translated at an approximately lower translation rate than in the prior year

the company s vessels sailed an average of approximately sailing days during the sailing season  which ended early due to the weakened economy  compared to an average of sailing days excluding the acquired voyageur vessels during the sailing season 
during the fiscal year ended march   sailing days increased days  or  to  sailing days  despite the early shutdown of customer quarries and cessation of iron ore shipments in december  from  sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  the following table summarizes the changes in the components of our revenue and vessel operating expenses as a result of changes in sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  usd in s sailing days freight and related revenue fuel and other surcharges outside voyage charter total revenue vessel operating expenses fiscal year ended march  changes in fiscal year ended march  increase attributable to acquired wms vessels increase attributable to the acquired voyageur vessels sailing days lost due to retirement of smallest vessel changes due to the saginaw engine upgrade other factors changes in outside voyage charter revenue other sub total fiscal year ended march  total revenue during the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to increased sailing days  higher fuel surcharges  price increases  improved vessel utilization and improved trade patterns 
freight and other related revenue generated from the company s owned vessels increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  freight and related revenue per sailing day increased  or  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  the fiscal year ended march  this increase reflects a combination of a larger fleet  price increases  higher water levels  productivity improvements  improved backhaul utilization and improved trading patterns 
fuel and other pass through surcharges increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  fuel and other surcharges revenue per sailing day increased  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  in the fiscal year ended march  outside voyage charter revenues increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in outside voyage charter revenues was due to the company outsourcing contractual commitments that it could not handle on a timely basis with its own capacity during the first eight months of the fiscal year as a result of the repowering of the saginaw  the carryover effect from the strike against the wms vessels in the fiscal year ended march   and the company s practice to outsource a portion of its normal business to optimize vessel efficiencies 
vessel operating expenses increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  which was attributable to crewing and operating the company s vessels for an additional sailing days 
vessel operating expenses per sailing day increased  or  to  in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  in the fiscal year ended march  the increased costs were primarily attributable to higher fuel prices  which were passed on to our customers 
repairs and maintenance expenses  which consist of expensed winter work  increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  repairs and maintenance per sailing day increased to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  from  during the fiscal year ended march  the increase was caused by million of expenses carried over from the winter lay up into the first quarter of fiscal year ended march   as compared to a carryover of only in the fiscal year ended march  our general and administrative expenses decreased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in general and administrative expenses included the elimination of million recorded by the consolidated wms vie in the fiscal year ended march   offset by an increase of in non cash equity compensation in the fiscal year ended march  excluding the wms vie  the cash portion of our general and administrative expenses declined to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  our general and administrative expense represented of revenues during the fiscal year ended march   a decrease from of revenues during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   million of our general and administrative expenses was attributable to our parent company and million was attributable to our operating companies 
depreciation expense rose to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in depreciation expense was primarily attributable to the full year of depreciation of the two voyageur vessels acquired in the second quarter of fiscal year ended march  and the depreciation expense associated with the investment in the saginaw repowering  offset by the retirement of our oldest and smallest vessel at the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year ended march  amortization of drydock costs increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  due to the drydocking of our two largest vessels during the winter layup period 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company amortized the deferred drydock costs of six of its twelve vessels compared to four vessels during the fiscal year ended march  amortization of intangibles decreased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  due to reduced amortization arising from the acquisition of the two voyageur vessels in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended march  amortization of chartering agreement costs of incurred during the fiscal year ended march  were not incurred in the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the acquisition of the wms vessels in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  the company incurred a loss of million on the retirement of its oldest and smallest vessel in the fiscal year ended march  additionally  the wms vie realized a gain of million on the sale of the wms vessels immediately prior to its deconsolidation from the company s financial statements on february  as a result of the items described above  during the fiscal year ended march   the company s operating income increased million to million compared to an operating loss of million during the fiscal year ended march  interest expense increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  this increase in interest expense was a result of the additional indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions of the voyager and wms vessels and the repowering upgrade to the saginaw 
the company also incurred higher interest expense with its revolving credit facilities in connection with the higher cash balances held on the company s balance sheet during the second half of fiscal year ended march  we recorded a loss on interest rate swap contracts of million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to a loss of million incurred in the fiscal year ended march  due to company s recording the fair value of our two interest rate swap agreements  which were signed in connection with our amended and restated credit agreement 
the wms vie was deconsolidated from the company s consolidated financial statements effective february  following the acquisition of the wms vessels  resulting in a loss 
our income before income taxes was in the fiscal year ended march  compared to a loss before income taxes of million in the fiscal year ended march  our provision for income tax expense was million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to an income tax benefit of million during the fiscal year ended march  the company recorded a million valuation allowance against its us federal net deferred assets during the fourth fiscal quarter ended march  due to taxable net operating losses for the past three fiscal years 
our net loss was million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to a net loss of million in the fiscal year ended march we accrued million for cash dividends on our preferred stock during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the dividends accrued at a rate of for the three month period ended march  when the dividends are not paid in cash  the rate increases every six months to a cap of  and will increase to effective july   assuming cash dividends have not yet been paid 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded million of stock warrant inducement discount expense in connection with the per warrant discount on the million warrants which were exercised during that fiscal year 
our net loss applicable to common stockholders decreased million to a loss of million during the fiscal year ended march   compared to a loss of million during the fiscal year ended march during the fiscal year ended march   the company operated five vessels in the us and seven vessels in canada  and the percentage of our total freight and other revenue  fuel and other surcharge revenue  vessel operating expenses  repairs and maintenance costs  and combined depreciation and amortization costs approximate the percentage of vessel ownership by country 
our outside voyage charter revenue and costs relate solely to our canadian subsidiary and approximately of our general and administrative costs are incurred in canada 
approximately two thirds of our interest expense is incurred in canada  consistent with our percentage of overall indebtedness by country 
approximately of our loss on interest rate swap contracts was realized in canada based on the larger amount of indebtedness and greater decrease of interest rates in canada than in the us during the fiscal year ended march  in addition  approximately million of our million of tax provision was incurred in canada since a valuation allowance of approximately million was recorded in the us during the fiscal year ended march  all of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the us 
impact of inflation and changing prices during the fiscal year ended march   there were major fluctuations in our fuel costs 
however  our contracts with our customers provide for recovery of these costs over specified rates through fuel surcharges 
in addition  there were major changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  which impacted our translation of revenue and costs to us dollars by a reduction of approximately 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations  the proceeds of our credit facility and proceeds from sales of our common stock 
our principal uses of cash are vessel acquisitions  capital expenditures  drydock expenditures  operations and interest and principal payments under our credit facility 
information on our consolidated cash flow is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows categorized by operating  investing and financing activities which is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and march we believe cash generated from our operations and availability of borrowing under our credit facility will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months 
however  if the company experiences a material shortfall to its financial forecasts or if the company s customers materially delay their receivable payments due to further deterioration of economic conditions  the company may breach its financial covenants and collateral thresholds and be strained for liquidity 
the company has implemented a program to reduce costs relative to actual fiscal expenses  maintained its continued focus on productivity gains and is closely monitoring customer credit and accounts receivable balances 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of million compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due to substantially higher cash earnings utilized to pay down the higher payables balance at the beginning of the fiscal year ended march  and a million decrease in drydock costs in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the sum of net income and adjustments to reconcile with net cash provided totaled million  including million of equity compensation  offset by deferred drydock costs of million and reductions in cash provided from operating assets and liabilities of million 
during the fiscal year ended march   the sum of net income plus adjustments to reconcile with net cash used totaled million and cash paid for drydock costs equal to million  offset by cash provided by operating assets and liabilities equal to million for a total of net cash provided equal to million 
the company did not incur any bad debt write offs or material slowdowns in receivable collections during the fiscal year ended march  the timing of the end of the company s fiscal year in relation to the sailing season allows most of the prior season s receivables to be collected prior to the end of the company s fiscal year 
in addition  the later start of a sailing season can modestly reduce the amount of accounts payable in the company s balance sheet at the end of our fiscal year 
cash used in investing activities decreased by million to net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was attributable to million related to the acquisition of the voyageur vessels and million in purchases of fixed asset in the fiscal year ended march  cash flows provided from financing activities decreased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company made net borrowings under its revolving credit facility of million and made principal payments on its term debt of million 
during the fiscal year fiscal ended march   the company received million in proceeds of long term debt  including million in connection with the voyageur transaction 
the remaining million of the proceeds were received in connection with entering into the amended and restated credit agreement on february  and used to finance the wms vessels acquisition and a portion of the saginaw repowering project 
in addition  the company and the consolidated wms vie paid off a combined million of long term debt and million of debt financing costs in the fiscal year ended march   offset by the proceeds of million from a blocked cash account on february  during the fiscal year ended march   the company also received million of warrant exercise proceeds and revolver borrowings net of repayments of million 
during the fiscal year ended march   long term debt  including the current portion  decreased to million from million in the fiscal year ending march   which reflected million in scheduled principal payments and an million decrease attributable to the currency translation of our canadian debt into us dollars 
our amended and restated credit agreement  as amended  requires the company to meet certain quarterly and annual financial covenants  including minimum ebitda as defined therein  minimum fixed charge ratios  maximum senior debt to ebitda ratios  and maximum capital expenditures and drydock expenditures 
the company met those financial covenants during the fiscal year ended march  the covenants are set in canadian dollars in order to better match the cash earnings and debt levels of the business by currency 
preferred stock and preferred stock dividends the company has accrued  but not paid  its preferred stock dividends since january  the shares of the series a convertible preferred stock rank senior to the company s common stock with respect to liquidation and dividends  are entitled to receive a cash dividend at the annual rate of based on the per share issue price  payable quarterly subject to increases of for each six month period in respect of which the dividend is not timely paid  up to a maximum of  subject to reversion to upon payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends  are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at any time at the option of the series a preferred stockholder at a conversion price of per share based on the per share issue price and subject to adjustment or shares of common stock for each series a preferred share subject to adjustment  are convertible into shares of the company s common stock based on a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment at the option of the company if  after the third anniversary of our acquisition of lower lakes  the trading price of the company s common stock for trading days within any trading day period equals or exceeds per share subject to adjustment  may be redeemed by the company in connection with certain change of control or acquisition transactions  will vote on an as converted basis with the company s common stock  and have a separate vote over certain material transactions or changes involving the company 
the accrued dividend payable at march  was million  and at march  was million 
as of march   the effective rate of preferred dividends was as of march  
the dividend rate will increase to effective july  if the dividend is not paid in cash and will increase every six months thereafter until it reaches or the accrued dividends are paid in cash 
the company is limited in the payment of preferred stock dividends by the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the company s amended and restated credit agreement 
in addition  the company has made the decision to make its investments in vessels before applying cash to pay preferred stock dividends 
under the terms of the preferred stock  upon the conversion of the preferred stock to common stock  a subordinated promissory note will be issued whereby the cash dividends will accrue at the rates set for the preferred stock and the note must be paid at the earlier of the second anniversary of the conversion  or seven years from the initial issuance date of the preferred stock  whichever is earlier 
investments in capital expenditures and drydockings we expended million in paid and unpaid capital expenditures and drydock expenses during the fiscal year ended march   including million relating to carryover from the winter season  compared to million  including a carryover of million  in the fiscal year ended march  excluding the wms vessel acquisition 
our capital expenditures and drydock expenses for the winter season were million  and we estimate that we will incur approximately an additional million of capital expenditures in the quarter ended june  related to the winter lay up period 
foreign exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposure related to the currency related remeasurements of various financial instruments denominated in the canadian dollar fair value risk and operating cash flows denominated in the canadian dollar cash flow risk 
these exposures are associated with period to period changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
at march   our liability for financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately cdn million of term borrowings in canada and cdn million of revolving borrowings in canada 
although we have tried to match our indebtedness and cash flows from earnings by country  the sudden change in exchange rates can increase the indebtedness converted to us dollars before operating cash flows can make up for such a currency conversion change 
from a cash flow perspective  our operations are insulated against changes in currency rates as operations in canada and the united states have revenues and expenditures denominated in local currencies and our operations are cash flow positive 
however  as stated above  the majority of our financial liabilities are denominated in canadian dollars which exposes us to currency risks related to principal payments and interest payments on such financial liability instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates associated with revolving our indebtedness under our amended and restated credit agreement  which carries interest rates which vary with canadian prime rates and ba rates for canadian borrowings  and us prime rates and libor rates on us borrowings 
we entered into two interest rate swap contracts for approximately of our term loans for the remaining term of such loans based on three month ba rates for the canadian term loans and three month us libor rates for the us term loans 
the rates on these instruments  prior to the addition of the lender s margin  are on the canadian term loans  and on the us term loans 
we will be exposed to interest rate risk under our interest rate swap contracts if such contracts are required to be amended or terminated earlier than their termination dates 
critical accounting policies rand s significant accounting policies are presented in note to its audited consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
while all accounting policies affect the financial statements  certain policies may be viewed as critical 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
revenue recognition the company generates revenues from freight billings under contracts of affreightment voyage charters generally on a rate per ton basis based on origin destination and cargo carried 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue and expense recognition for freight services in progress method  voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period when the following conditions are met the company has a signed contract of affreightment  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
included in freight billings are other fees such as fuel surcharges and other freight surcharges  which represent pass through charges to customers for toll fees  lockage fees and ice breaking fees paid to other parties 
fuel surcharges are recognized over the duration of the voyage  while freight surcharges are recognized when the associated costs are incurred 
freight surcharges are less than of total revenue 
the company subcontracts excess customer demand to other freight providers 
service to customers under such arrangements is transparent to the customer and no additional services are provided to customers 
consequently  revenues recognized for customers serviced by freight subcontractors are recognized on the same basis as described above 
in addition  all revenues are presented on a gross basis in accordance with the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  financing costs  trademarks  trade names  non competition agreements and customer relationships and contracts 
chartering agreement costs were primarily legal costs of establishing the time chartering agreements with the wms vie  including loan and guaranty documentation 
these costs were amortized over the term of the time chartering agreement  and related debt 
other intangibles are amortized as follows trademarks and trade names years straight line non competition agreements years straight line customer relationships and contracts years straight line non competition agreements are amortized over the period which consists of the remainder of the employment contract and the non compete period after its expiration 
although customer contracts have a typical duration of only three to five years  the company has experienced a consistent track record of serial renewals by its significant contract customers and such customers comprise most of the company s business 
the company s customer relationships are fortified by the fact that there are a limited number of great lakes shipping companies as well as a declining number of vessels operating on the great lakes 
the company has an additional advantage in that it operates half of the vessels on the great lakes which are classified as river class vessels and capable of accessing docks and customers not accessible to larger vessels 
accordingly  customers have a substantial interest in protecting their great lakes transportation relationships 
based on the foregoing  and in compliance with sfas  the company has determined that years is the most appropriate best estimate amortization period for its customer relationships and contracts 
the company has estimated a year useful life for its trademarks and trade names 
in accordance with paragraph of sfas  since the company cannot reliably determine the pattern of economic benefit of the use of the customer relationships and trademarks and trade names  the company has determined that the straight line amortization is appropriate 
impairment of fixed assets and intangible assets with finite lives fixed assets and finite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when a triggering event occurs 
examples of such triggering events include a significant disposal of a portion of such assets  an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business  difficulties or delays in integrating the business  and a significant change in the operations of an acquired business 
the company has determined that there has been an adverse change in our markets that could affect the valuation of our assets 
accordingly  as of march   the company updated its estimates of undiscounted cash flows for each of its asset groups to test our long term assets for recoverability 
these estimates are subject to uncertainty 
we then compared those undiscounted cash flows by asset group to the sum of the carrying value of each asset group and determined that there were no impairment indicators 
impairment of goodwill as of march   the company made its annual test of goodwill 
significant assumptions are inherent in this process  including estimates of our undiscounted cashflows  discount rates  comparable companies and comparable transactions 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets 
the company presently has no intangible assets not subject to amortization other than goodwill 
the fair market values of each of our reporting units exceeded the sum of the carrying values of those reporting units at march  income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recognized  if necessary  to measure tax benefits to the extent that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
the determination to set up a valuation allowance is dependent on management s estimates of whether taxable income in future periods for each taxable entity is sufficient that deferred income tax assets will be realized  except for the change in foreign exchange loss  based on the performance of the entity and the expected timing of the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities  and tax net operating losses in particular entities in recent years 
such management estimates are subject to uncertainty 
the company has adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin effective april  fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
establishing accruals for tax benefits requires management to make estimates and assessments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audit issues if any and amounts recorded on financial statements 
the ultimate resolution of such uncertain tax benefits may differ from management s estimate  potentially impacting the company s results of operations  cashflows  or financial position 
however  the impact of the company s reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with fin did not have a material effect on the results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
stock based compensation the company has adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method 
this method requires compensation cost to be recognized beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date 
under this method  the company recognizes compensation expense for all newly granted awards and awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after april  compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards that were outstanding at april  is recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period based on the fair value at date of grant as calculated under the black scholes option pricing model

ifrs in november of  the sec released a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board iasb 
under the proposed roadmap  the company may be required in fiscal to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs 
however  the sec will make a determination in regarding the mandatory adoption of ifrs 
the company is currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on its consolidated financial statements  and it will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of ifrs

the three levels of inputs used are as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  such as uoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities
