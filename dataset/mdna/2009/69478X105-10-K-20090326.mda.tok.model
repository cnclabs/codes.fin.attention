item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary our principal business is attracting deposits from small businesses and consumers and investing those deposits together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  primarily in commercial business loans and various types of commercial real estate loans 
in  the bank expects to fund substantially all of the loans that it originates or purchases through deposits  fhlb advances and internally generated funds 
deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates of interest primarily on competing investments  account maturities and the levels of savings in the bank s market area 
the bank s ability to originate and purchase loans is influenced by the general level of product available 
the bank s results of operations are also affected by the bank s provision for loan losses and the level of operating expenses 
the bank s operating expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  premises and occupancy expenses  and other general expenses 
the company s results of operations are also affected by prevailing economic conditions  competition  government policies and other actions of regulatory agencies 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s financial statements in item hereof 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions management uses are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at balance sheet dates and the company s results of operations for future reporting periods 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the company s financial statements that are most susceptible to significant change

net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to interest rates

for the year ended december   the company reported net income of  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million or per diluted share for the same period in the million  or  decrease in net income in compared to was primarily the result of a charge of million pre tax  or per diluted shares after tax  associated with the termination of the mutual funds investment held by the bank and of an other than temporary impairment otti charge of million  or per diluted share after tax  that was recorded on private label mbss that the bank received when it redeemed its shares in the mutual funds in the second quarter of interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to interest income on loans receivable decreasing million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income on loans was primarily the result of a decrease in the average yield of from in to in the decrease in loan yield is primarily due to the re pricing of our short term adjustable rate income property loans as general market interest rates in the marketplace have declined during interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million  or  decrease was primarily due to a decrease of basis points in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities resulting from the lower interest rate environment during net interest income 
our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by several factors including the level of  and the relationship between  the dollar amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relationship between repricing or maturity of our variable rate and fixed rate loans and securities  and our deposits and borrowings  and the magnitude of our non interest earning assets  including non accrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
net interest income before provision for loan losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in the current year provision of  million  or  for loan losses was primarily due to increases in the bank s net charge off of  and its unallocated allowance of  net charge offs in were  compared to  for the increase in the unallocated allowance is attributable to management s expectation that  with the weakening economy and the constraints on the financial markets  our borrowers and their businesses and or the collateral securing our loans could be adversely impacted and this may affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans 
noninterest income 
noninterest income was a loss million for the year ended december   compared to income of million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the aforementioned million otti charge  the loss of million from the sale of the mutual fund investments and a decrease in income generated by loan sales of million  compared to the same period in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million  or  decrease in noninterest expense was principally due to decreases in compensation and benefits of million and legal and audit expenses of  in compared to the decrease in compensation and benefits for the year is attributable primarily to management s staff reductions  which occurred during the fourth quarter of and in the first quarter of the reductions in staff were in connection with the bank s overall lower loan production levels in as compared to the number of full time equivalent employees at the bank at december  was compared to at december  the decrease in legal expense is primarily due to a lawsuit that was settled in june that cost the bank a total of  in legal and settlement fees during the year of  with no such expense in income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased to  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the company had income before income taxes of  for the year ended december  compared to income before income taxes of million for the year ended december  comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and december  general 
for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million or per diluted share  compared with net income of million or per diluted share for the same period in the million  or  decrease in net income in compared to was primarily the result of increases in the provision for loan losses and compensation and benefit expense of million and million  respectively  as well as the reversal of the valuation allowance for deferred taxes in of million 
for both the years ended december  and the bank s gain on loan sales was million 
during and  the bank sold loans secured by multi family properties totaling million and million  respectively  for a gain on sale of million and million  respectively 
during the third quarter of there were changes in the secondary market for multi family loans which have required the bank to adjust its pricing on these product types 
additionally  the southern california apartment market is seeing a significant slowdown in sales activity as a gap between buyer and seller expectations has created a wait and see market 
due to the above changes in the multi family loan market  we expect that future gains on loan sales to be substantially reduced or eliminated 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to interest income on loans receivable increasing million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income on loans was primarily the result of an increase in the average loan balance of million from million in to million in combined with an increase of basis points in the average yield on these loans from for to for the increase in loan yield is primarily due to the re pricing of our short term adjustable rate income property loans and the origination of higher yielding loans during interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million  or  increase primarily reflects an increase in the average balance of deposits of million  during the year  combined with a basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities that was due to a higher interest rate environment 
net interest income 
our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by several factors including the level of  and the relationship between  the dollar amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relationship between repricing or maturity of our variable rate and fixed rate loans and securities  and our deposits and borrowings  and the magnitude of our non interest earning assets  including non accrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
net interest income before provision for loan losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in the current year provision of million  or  for loan losses was primarily due to an increase in the bank s net charge off of  as well as an increase in the unallocated allowance of  net charge offs in were  compared to  for in the fourth quarter of  the bank charged off the unsecured portion of six sba loans totaling  due to the deterioration of the clients businesses 
the increase in the unallocated allowance is due to the bank s management belief that the overall national economy is weakening and may affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans 
noninterest income 
noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  was primarily due to a decrease in loan servicing income of  due to fewer prepayment penalties collected in compared to partially offsetting the decrease from loan servicing income was an increase in other income and bank fee income of  and  respectively 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million  or  increase in noninterest expense was principally due to increases in compensation and benefits of million  legal and audit expenses of  and other expenses of  in compared to the increase in compensation and benefits for the year is attributable primarily to the bank s branch expansion and the hiring of additional business bankers during the latter part of and the early part of during the fourth quarter of  the bank laid off employees due to the reduction in our loan volume 
the number of employees at the bank at december  was  compared to at december  income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the company had income before income taxes of million for the year ended december  compared to income before income taxes of million for the year ended december  in  the company eliminated its remaining valuation allowance for deferred taxes which reduced its provision by million 
the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance is due to management s forecast of taxable earnings  based on assumptions regarding the company s growth in the near future 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets of the company were million as of december   compared to million as of december  the million  or  decrease in total assets is primarily due to a decrease in federal funds sold of million 
total liabilities of the company were million at december  compared to million at december  the million  or  decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in borrowings  which was partially offset by an increase in deposits of million 
total deposits at december  were million compared to million at december  at december  and  our stockholders equity amounted to million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million  or  in stockholders equity is primarily due to the repurchase and retirement of  shares of common stock at a cost of million  or at an average cost of per share  and the decrease in accumulated adjustment to stockholder s equity of million due to the temporary decrease in value of our investment portfolio 
liquidity our primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans  deposits  fhlb advances and other borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we seek to maintain a level of liquid assets to ensure a safe and sound operation 
our liquid assets are comprised of cash and unpledged investments 
our average liquidity ratios were  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of cash balances plus unpledged securities by the sum of deposits that mature in one year or less plus transaction accounts and fhlb advances 
our liquidity is monitored daily 
we believe the level of liquid assets is sufficient to meet current and anticipated funding needs 
liquid assets of the bank represented approximately  and of total assets at december   and  respectively 
at december   the bank had five unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks totaling million to purchase federal funds as business needs dictate 
we also have a line of credit with the fhlb allowing us to borrow up to of the bank s total assets as of september  or million  million of which was outstanding as of december  the fhlb advance line is collateralized by eligible loan collateral and fhlb stock 
at december   we had approximately million of loans pledged to secure fhlb borrowings 
at december   we had zero in outstanding commitments to originate or purchase loans compared to zero and  at december  and  respectively 
the bank s loan to deposit and borrowing ratio was  and as of december   and  respectively 
certificates of deposit  which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled million 
we expect to retain a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit at maturity 
the bank has a policy in place that permits the purchase of brokered funds  in an amount not to exceed of total assets  as a secondary source for funding 
at december   the balance of brokered time deposits was approximately million 
the corporation is a company separate and apart from the bank that must provide for its own liquidity 
the corporation s primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation 
management believes that such restrictions will not have a material impact on the ability of the corporation to meet its ongoing cash obligations 
the financial code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its shareholders in excess of the lesser of a a bank s retained earnings  or b bank s net income for its last three fiscal years  less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority owned subsidiary of the bank to the shareholders of the bank during such period 
however  a bank may  with the approval of the dfi  make a distribution to its shareholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of x its retained earnings  y its net income for its last fiscal year  or z its net income for its current fiscal year 
in the event that the dfi determines that the shareholders equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound  the dfi may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution 
the amount available for distribution from the bank to the corporation was approximately million at december  capital resources the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
at december  and  the bank s leverage capital amounted to million and million  respectively  and its risk based capital amounted to million and million  respectively 
as a result  the bank exceeded the capital levels required to be considered well capitalized at that date 
pursuant to regulatory guidelines under prompt corrective action rules  a bank must have total risk based capital of or greater  tier risk based capital of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater to be considered well capitalized 
at december   the bank s total risk based capital  tier risk based capital and leverage ratios were   and  respectively 
contractual obligations and commitments the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and to meet required capital needs 
the following schedule summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations fhlb borrowings other borrowings subordinated debentures certificates of deposit operating leases total contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments with off balance sheet risk as of december  in thousands other unused commitments home equity lines of credit commercial lines of credit other lines of credit standby letters of credit undisbursed construction funds total commitments impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts except with respect to securities classified as available for sale which are carried at market value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same magnitude as the price of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk management 
the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with guidelines approved by our board of directors through the establishment of prudent asset and liability concentration guidelines 
through such activities  management seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
management monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the bank s board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the bank s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the bank s capital in various interest rate scenarios 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
economic value of equity 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model that estimates the change in the bank s economic value of equity eve under alternative interest rate scenarios 
the model computes the net present value of capital by discounting all expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts under each rate scenario 
an eve ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the eve ratio  in basis points  caused by an increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline sensitivity measure 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the following table shows the eve and projected change in the eve of the bank at december   assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of   and basis points bp as of december  dollars in thousands eve as of portfolio economic value of equity value of assets change in rates amount change change eve ratio change bp bp bp bp bp bp bp static bp bp bp bp bp bp certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in eve requires the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
although the eve measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to  does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income  and will differ from actual results 
selected assets and liabilities which are interest rate sensitive 
the following table provides information regarding the bank s primary categories of assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for the year ended december  the information presented reflects the expected cash flows of the primary categories by year  including the related weighted average interest rate 
the cash flows for loans are based on maturity and re pricing date 
the loans and mbss that have adjustable rate features are presented in accordance with their next interest repricing date 
cash flow information on interest bearing liabilities  such as passbooks  now accounts and money market accounts is also adjusted for expected decay rates  which are based on historical information 
in addition  for purposes of cash flow presentation  premiums or discounts on purchased assets and mark to market adjustments are excluded from the amounts presented
