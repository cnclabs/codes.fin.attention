item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks factors under item a of this report 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time the products are received by the customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for store sales at the point at which the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register 
for on line sales  we recognize revenue at the time the customer receives the product 
we estimate and defer revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in transit to the customer 
customers typically receive goods within one week of shipment 
we reflect amounts related to shipping billed to customers in net sales and the related costs in cost of goods sold 
sales tax collected from customers on retail sales are recorded net of retail sales at the time of the transaction 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
if actual returns are greater than those projected  we may include additional sales returns in the future 
discounts offered to customers consist primarily of point of sale markdowns and are recorded at the time of the related sale as a reduction of revenue 
we include the value of points and rewards earned by our loyalty program members as a liability and a reduction of revenue at the time the points and rewards are earned based on historical conversion and redemption rates 
we recognize the associated revenue when the rewards are redeemed or expire 
we carry gift certificates sold as a liability and recognize revenue when the gift certificate is redeemed 
similarly  customers may receive a store credit in exchange for returned goods 
we carry store credits as a liability until redeemed 
we recognize unredeemed store credits and gift certificates as other income three and four years after issuance 
we record royalty revenue from product licensees as the greater of the minimum amount guaranteed in the contract or units sold 
we recognize wholesale licensee revenue from sale of product to international licensee operated bebe stores at the time the licensee receives shipment 
we exclude these stores from comparable store sales 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and awards issued to employees in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under sfas no 
r  stock based awards to employees are required to be recognized as compensation expense  based on the calculated fair value on the date of grant 
we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected term  which affect the calculated values 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
we determine market based on the estimated net realizable value  which is generally the merchandise selling price 
to ensure that our raw material is properly valued  we age the fabric inventory and record a reserve in accordance with our established policy  which is based on historical experience 
to ensure our finished goods inventory is properly valued  we review the age and turnover of our inventory and record a reserve if the selling price is marked down below cost 
these assumptions can have an impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
we estimate shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and balance sheet date based on historic shrinkage trends 
marketable securities 
we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities ars consisting of federally insured student loan backed securities and insured municipal authority bonds 
as of july   our ars portfolio totaled approximately million  million classified as trading securities and million net of a temporary impairment charge of million  of which million has been recognized in the current year classified as available for sale securities 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the uncertainties in the credit markets that began in february have affected our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
historically the fair value of ars investments had approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid  and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the securities  or at maturity 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to with principal distributions occurring on certain securities prior to maturity 
in november  we entered into a settlement agreement related to our ars held with ubs financial services  inc ubs that grants us certain rights related to these ars the right 
beginning june   at our request  ubs has agreed to purchase all of our ars currently held with them at par value 
conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
the enforceability of the right results in a put option which should be recognized as a free standing asset separate from the ars 
upon acceptance of the offer from ubs  we recorded the put option at fair value of million  with a corresponding credit to interest income 
the put option does not meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas no 
therefore  we have elected to measure the put option at fair value under sfas no 
 which permits an entity to elect the fair value option for recognized financial assets 
as a result  unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings 
the increase in the fair value of the put option of million in the last two quarters of the current year has been recorded with a corresponding credit to interest and other income  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to accepting the ubs offer  we recorded our ars held with ubs as investments available for sale  with an associated unrealized loss included in other comprehensive income 
in connection with our acceptance of the ubs offer in november  we transferred approximately million in ars subject to the ubs settlement from investments available for sale to trading securities in accordance with sfas no 
and recorded a loss on investments of approximately million 
as a result  changes in fair value of the ars have been recorded as a component of net income 
we intend to exercise the right when it becomes available  and as such the associated investments have been classified as short term on the balance sheet 
the remainder of our ars investment portfolio of million  net of a temporary impairment charge of million  remains available for sale on our balance sheet 
the related temporary impairment charge remains as a loss in other comprehensive income 
we also hold short term available for sale securities totaling million at july  that consist of treasury bills and are classified as available for sale securities on our balance sheet 
we review our impairments in accordance with guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a loss in the consolidated statement of income and reduces net income for the applicable accounting period 
when evaluating the investments for other than temporary impairment  we estimate the expected cash flows of the underlying collateral by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto  and our intent to sell  or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell  the investment before recovery of the investment s unamortized cost basis 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
in addition  ubs s obligation under the right is not secured by its assets and does not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligation under the right 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the right 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as store closures or poor performing stores  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
generally  if the undiscounted cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s estimated fair value 
however  in the case of bebe sport stores we evaluated the net book value against potential replacement costs  since we are in the process of a name change and will only record an impairment to the extent net book value exceeds replacement costs 
in addition  at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset 
historically  our impairment charges have been immaterial 
during fiscal  we recorded an million charge for the impairment of store assets 
we recorded an  impairment charge in fiscal and did not record an impairment charge during fiscal we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate  however significant changes from our current future forecasts could result in additional impairment charges 
accrued litigation 
we accrue estimates of probable liabilities associated with lawsuits and claims 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
as information becomes available  we assess the potential liabilities related to pending litigation and may revise our estimates as necessary 
such revisions of estimates could materially impact the results of operations and financial position 
self insurance 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for employee related health care benefits 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of those claims incurred but not reported 
any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  we may need to adjust reserves in the future 
income taxes 
on july   we adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition issues 
to the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities  except for certain items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value at least annually 
we elected to partially adopt the provisions of sfas no 
as of july  for financial instruments  as permitted by fsp although the partial adoption of sfas no 
did not materially impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow  we are now required to provide additional disclosures as part of its financial statements 
we do not expect the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas delayed by fsp to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  statement of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
we adopted sfas no 
as of july  since the adoption of sfas no 
 we elected the fair value option for our ars written put right related to our ars held with ubs 
we will recognize any change in the ars written put right as a gain or loss in the statement of income 
in april  the fasb issued fsp sfas no 
and apb no 
 interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  which amends sfas no 
 disclosures about fair values of financial instruments  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements 
fsp no 
also amends apb no 
 interim financial reporting  to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
fsp no 
is effective for interim periods ending after june  we do not expect that the adoption of fsp no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  statement of operations  or cash flows as it is related to disclosure only 
in april  the fasb issued fsp sfas no 
and sfas no 
 recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which amends the other than temporary guidance in us gaap for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
is effective for interim periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
with no material impact on our consolidated financial position  statement of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued fsp sfas no 
 determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  which provides additional guidance in estimating fair value in accordance with sfas no 
when the volume and level of activity for both financial and non financial assets or liabilities have significantly decreased 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after july  and shall be applied prospectively 
early adoption for periods ending before march  is not permitted 
we have adopted sfas no 
with no material impact on our consolidated financial position  statement of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 subsequent events 
fas defines subsequent events as events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date  but before the financial statements are issued 
it defines two types of subsequent events recognized subsequent events  which provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date  and non recognized subsequent events  which provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date  but arose before the financial statements were issued 
recognized subsequent events are required to be recognized in the financial statements  and non recognized subsequent events are required to be disclosed 
the statement requires entities to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated  and the basis for that date 
fas is consistent with current practice and did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations our fiscal year ends on the first saturday after june fiscal  and included  and weeks 
the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended july  july  july  statement of operating data net sales cost of sales  including production and occupancy gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  occupancy costs and production costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs 
fiscal years ended july  and july  net sales 
net sales decreased to million during the year ended july  from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in comparable store sales resulting primarily from the overall macroeconomic environment  in which we saw lower traffic and conversion in stores  and a decrease in our on line sales 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in new stores not included in comparable store sales of million  an increase in wholesale sales of million and an increase in royalty revenue of million 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to million for the year ended july  from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin of was lower than the prior year at primarily due to higher markdowns and unfavorable occupancy leverage 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to during fiscal from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to deleveraging of store depreciation expense and other fixed costs  employee acquisition and termination costs  and fixed assets write downs and write offs 
interest and other income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income  net of other expenses  during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest and other income resulted from investments in lower yielding tax exempt investments and money market funds and an approximately million loss on the ars written put right 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the lower effective tax rate for was primarily attributable to our tax exempt interest income as a percent of income before tax and a tax refund from amending returns 
fiscal years ended july  and july  net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended july  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in sales is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of million generated by stores not included in the comparable store sales base  online sales of million and wholesale sales to international licensees of million 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales and an additional million in sales in fiscal due to the extra week in fiscal gross margin 
gross margin decreased to million for the year ended july  from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin of was lower than prior year at primarily due to higher markdowns and unfavorable occupancy leverage  partially offset by higher initial markups

as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to during fiscal from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increases in compensation  depreciation and advertising 
interest and other income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income  net of other expenses  during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest and other income resulted from an increase in interest rates primarily on our auction rate securities and additions to our marketable securities balances due to positive operating results  partially offset by a decrease in cash and equivalents and investments due to the purchase of million shares of our outstanding stock from our former vice chairperson  neda mashouf  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the lower effective tax rate for was primarily attributable to an increase in tax exempt interest 
seasonality of business and quarterly results our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries 
as a result  our typical store generates a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the second quarter of our fiscal year which includes the holiday selling season compared to other quarters of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below seasonal norms during the second quarter of our fiscal year  our annual operating results would be negatively impacted 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
offer to exchange in september  we issued an offer to eligible option holders to exchange underwater options for a lesser number of options priced at the end of the offer period 
we anticipate conversion will be accretive to existing shareholders and may result in a non material expense 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements vary widely throughout the year and generally peak during the first and second fiscal quarters 
at july   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand of which approximately million  net of impairment charges of million  were invested in auction rate securities ars and approximately million were invested in treasury bills 
we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity in the ars to impact our ability to fund our operations in the foreseeable future and believe we have sufficient cash and equivalents to fund ongoing operations 
in addition  we have a revolving line of credit  the agreement for which we are transitioning from the bank of america to wells fargo  under which we may borrow or issue letters of credit up to a combined total of million 
as of july   there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the line of credit  and letters of credit outstanding totaled million 
as of july   we were not in compliance with respect to one covenant in each of these agreements requiring certain quarterly income levels 
we obtained a waiver from wells fargo as of july  the company has not obtained a waiver for its breach of covenant with bank of america as of july   but does not believe this breach to have significant impact on its operations 
at july   we had cash and equivalents of million held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions consisting of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
these funds invest in direct obligations of the government of the united states 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time we have approximately to million of invested cash and cash in operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to invested cash or cash in our operating accounts 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million 
the decrease of million for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in net earnings of million  in deferred rent of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in changes of working capital of million and increases in net loss on disposal of property of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and deferred income taxes of million 
net cash used by investing activities was million versus net cash provided by investing activities of million and net cash used by investing activities of million in fiscal  and the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in was primarily a result of a decrease in net proceeds of marketable equity securities of million  partially offset by a decrease in the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million 
capital expenditures of million in consisted of million related to the opening of new stores  million related to the relocation and expansion of existing stores  million related to investments in management information systems and million on other projects 
capital expenditures of million in consisted of million related to the opening of new stores  million related to the relocation and expansion of existing stores  million related to investments in management information systems and million on other projects 
we opened  and new stores in fiscal  and  and we expect to open stores in fiscal in fiscal year  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million for new stores and relocation and expansion of existing stores and approximately million for investments in information systems and other capital expenditures 
during fiscal  the average bebe  bebe sport and b bebe new store construction costs before tenant allowances were  and the average gross inventory investment per store was  net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily a result of the purchase of million shares of our outstanding common stock from our former vice chairperson neda mashouf at a price per share of  for an aggregate purchase price of million in the first quarter of fiscal this decrease was partially offset by the repurchase of million of our common stock during fiscal net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal we hold a variety of interest bearing ars consisting of federally insured student loan backed securities and insured municipal authority bonds 
as of july   our ars portfolio totaled approximately million  million classified as trading securities and million net of temporary impairment charge of million classified as available for sale securities 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the uncertainties in the credit markets that began in february have affected our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
historically the fair value of ars investments had approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid  and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the securities  or at maturity 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to with principal distributions occurring on certain securities prior to maturity 
in november  we entered into a settlement agreement related to our ars held with ubs financial services  inc ubs that grants us certain rights related to these ars the right 
beginning june   at our request  ubs has agreed to purchase all of our ars currently held with them at par value 
conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
the enforceability of the right results in a put option which should be recognized as a free standing asset separate from the ars 
upon acceptance of the offer from ubs  we recorded the put option at fair value of million  with a corresponding credit to interest income 
the put option does not meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas no 
therefore  we have elected to measure the put option at fair value under sfas no 
 which permits an entity to elect the fair value option for recognized financial assets 
as a result  unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings 
the increase in the fair value of the put option of million has been recorded with a corresponding credit to interest and other income  net  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations 
prior to accepting the ubs offer  we recorded our ars held with ubs as investments available for sale  with an associated unrealized loss included in other comprehensive income 
in connection with our acceptance of the ubs offer in november  we transferred approximately million in ars subject to the ubs settlement from investments available for sale to trading securities in accordance with sfas no 
and recorded a loss on investments of approximately million 
as a result  changes in fair value of the ars have been recorded as a component of net income 
we intend to exercise the right when it becomes available  and as such the associated investments have been classified as short term on the balance sheet 
we also hold short term available for sale securities totaling million at july  that consist of treasury bills and are classified as available for sale securities on our balance sheet 
in october  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
we may  from time to time  as business conditions warrant  purchase stock in the open market or through private transactions 
purchases may be increased  decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
the plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at management s discretion 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares at an average price per share of for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
during our first quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement with our former vice chairperson neda mashouf to purchase million shares of our common stock beneficially owned by ms 
mashouf at a price per share of  an aggregate purchase price of million 
we may purchase additional shares from ms 
mashouf or other shareholders in the future 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with our cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  liquidity of our auction rate securities  the size and number of new and expanded stores and or store concepts  investment costs for management information systems  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures  repurchase of stock and future results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands amount of commitment expiration period total less than year years years after years other commercial commitments operating leases trade letters of credit unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations and commercial commitments unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
included in the purchase obligations category above are commitments for inventory purchases  capital expenditures  information technology and professional services 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice  usually to days 
we excluded amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above 
the table above does not include liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits under fin as the company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of such fin liabilities  the table does not include million of income tax  interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits that are recorded as noncurrent liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet as of july  inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the recent past 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we currently maintain a portfolio of variable interest rate investments consisting of cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and both short term and long term investments consisting of ars 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable and tax exempt instruments 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
marketable securities are classified as trading or available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments are considered short term available for sale securities if the original maturity is between three months and twelve months  short term trading securities if they are ars related to the right with ubs  or long term investments if the original maturity is greater than twelve months 
historically the fair value of ars investments had approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we determined the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of july  using a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our investments in ars 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
the ars written put right is a free standing asset separate from the ars  and represents our contractual right to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value during the two year period beginning june  in order to value the ars written put right  we considered intrinsic value  time value of money and our assessment of the credit worthiness of ubs 
we have modified our investment strategy and increased our investments in more liquid money market investments 
an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rate of basis points from levels at july  would cause an additional decline of approximately  or million  in the fair market value of our investments in ars 
the following table lists our cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  short term trading securities and long term marketable securities at july  fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents weighted average interest rate short term available for sale securities weighted average interest rate trading securities weighted average interest rate long term available for sale securities weighted average interest rate total the interest payable on our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates rose significantly  our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected since we have no outstanding borrowings 
foreign currency risks we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states  substantially all of which are negotiated and settled in us dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we also operate a subsidiary for which the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  assets and liabilities of canada s operations are translated into us dollars at year end rates  while income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year 
the related translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholder s equity 
intercompany settlements are recorded in other income expense at the weighted average exchange rate for the year 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
