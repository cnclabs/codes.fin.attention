for fiscal years through fiscal  our fiscal year ended on january st in the year following the year mentioned 
commencing with fiscal  our fiscal year will end on the sunday closest to january st of the following year  typically resulting in a fifty two week year  but occasionally giving rise to an additional week  resulting in a fifty three week year 
fiscal  and ended on february   february  and january   respectively overview the world economy slowed considerably during fiscal as problems in global financial markets became more widespread and consumers cut back on retail spending amid fears of a global recession 
our sales growth slowed in the latter part of the third quarter of  driven in part by this reduced spending 
we believe that the challenging economic climate combined with the effect of the depreciation in the relative value of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar will continue to adversely affect our fiscal projections for sales and margin rates 
the current overall economic climate will result in a continued slowing of sales growth and have a negative impact on our gross margins in our fiscal year 
given the current economic conditions  our comparable store sales results and results of operations during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal have been negatively affected  and we believe that fiscal will also be negatively affected by continued reduced consumer spending and the short term volatility of foreign exchange rates  particularly in canada 
lululemon is highly sensitive to increases and decreases in consumer spending 
increased consumer spending in our corporate owned store locations create sales leverage  meaning that fixed expenses  such as occupancy costs  are spread across a greater revenue base  thereby improving operating margins 
but the reverse is also true sales deleveraging creates downward pressure on margins 
the absence of growth in comparable store sales and soft results in new markets impacted nearly all consolidated operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of total net sales 
in response to the changes in the world economy and the impact on our operating results  we have taken steps to address the deterioration in the retail environment and address our support structure 
these included the development and implementation of several important strategic initiatives as part of our strategy designed to increase customer traffic in our corporate owned store locations  reduce infrastructure expenses and improve our operating results 
these actions have been designed to structure our business for long term profitable growth and protect our brand integrity 
the more significant actions taken by lululemon in fiscal to invigorate our business included a plan for management to continue ongoing evaluations of our portfolio of corporate owned store locations and to refine our real estate selection process 
in fiscal we closed one corporate owned store in texas which was underperforming 
as we continue our evaluation we may in future periods close additional corporate owned store locations  dispose of property and equipment and exit in place operating leases  a reduction in employee head count both in our corporate owned store locations and at head office  including changes in the structure between corporate owned store locations and head office  the introduction of temporary locations during the peak holiday selling season which enabled us to reach incremental customers and generate incremental full price sales as well as building additional awareness and demand for our brand in new markets  and a reduction in discretionary spending and improved efficiencies brought about by our it implementation 

table of contents prior to changes in the world economy  we reevaluated our operating performance in japan and our strategic priorities 
this timely analysis led to our decision to discontinue our operations in japan in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal we closed three of our stores in japan and closed our fourth and final store in japan during the third quarter of fiscal and classified our japanese operations as discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal japan represented less than of our revenues in fiscal and required a disproportionate amount of management time and attention during fiscal we agreed with descente to end all operations as a joint venture in the third quarter of fiscal we believe that our time  attention and capital resources are best spent focused on our top priorities  which are growth in the united states  where we plan to open six stores during fiscal  and the development of an e commerce business 
management expects lululemon to continue to face a very difficult economic environment throughout fiscal  in both north america and internationally 
we expect to report negative comparable store sales for fiscal additionally  our earnings for fiscal may be impacted by additional provisions for asset impairment and lease exit costs if management identifies additional underperforming corporate owned store locations to close 
lululemon plans to be disciplined in its approach to new store openings  in both existing and new markets  and adjust as needed in response to further worsening in the world economy 
operating segment overview lululemon is a designer and retailer of technical athletic apparel operating primarily in north america 
our yoga inspired apparel is marketed under the lululemon athletica brand name 
we offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories including fitness pants  shorts  tops and jackets designed for athletic pursuits such as yoga  dance  running and general fitness 
as of february   our branded apparel was principally sold through corporate owned and franchise stores that are primarily located in canada and the united states 
we believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with and gain insights from our customers while providing us with greater control of our brand 
in fiscal  of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in canada  of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the united states and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of north america 
in fiscal  of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in canada  of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the united states and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of north america 
in fiscal  of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in canada  of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the united states and of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of north america 
our net revenue has grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this represents a compound net annual growth rate of 
our net revenue from continuing operations also increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  representing an increase 
our increase in net revenue from fiscal to fiscal resulted from the addition of retail locations in fiscal  retail locations in fiscal  retail locations in fiscal and retail locations in fiscal  and comparable store sales growth of   and in fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our ability to open new stores and grow sales in existing stores has been driven by increasing demand for our technical athletic apparel and a growing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand 
we believe our superior products  strategic store locations  inviting store environment  grassroots marketing approach and distinctive corporate culture are responsible for our strong financial performance 
we have recently increased our focus on our men s apparel line  net revenue from which increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and represented approximately of net revenue in fiscal versus of net revenue in fiscal  and our accessories business  which represented approximately and of net revenue for each of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we have three reportable segments corporate owned stores  franchises and other 
we report our segments based on the financial information we use in managing our businesses 
while we receive financial information for each corporate owned store  we have aggregated all of the corporate owned stores into one reportable segment due to the similarities in the economic and other characteristics of these stores 
our franchises segment accounted for of our net revenues from continuing operations in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near term growth strategy  and we therefore expect that if the revenue derived from our franchise stores continues to comprise less than of the net revenue we report in 
table of contents future fiscal years  we will re evaluate our segment reporting disclosures 
our other operations accounted for less than of our net revenues from continuing operations in each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal as of february   we sold our products through corporate owned stores located in canada and the united states 
as previously disclosed  we discontinued our operations in japan in the third quarter of fiscal we plan to increase our net revenue in north america by opening additional corporate owned stores in new and existing markets 
corporate owned stores net revenue accounted for of total net revenue in fiscal and of total net revenue in fiscal as of february   we also had five franchise stores located in north america and five franchise stores located in australia 
in the past  we have entered into franchise agreements to distribute lululemon athletica branded products to more quickly disseminate our brand name and increase our net revenue and net income 
in exchange for the use of our brand name and the ability to operate lululemon athletica stores in certain regions  our franchisees generally pay us a one time franchise fee and ongoing royalties based on their gross revenue 
additionally  unless otherwise approved by us  our franchisees are required to sell only lululemon athletica branded products  which are purchased from us at a discount to the suggested retail price 
pursuing new franchise partnerships or opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near term store growth strategy 
in some cases  we may exercise our contractual rights to purchase franchises where it is attractive to us 
we believe that our athletic apparel has and will continue to appeal to consumers outside of north america who value its technical attributes as well as its function and style 
in  we opened our first franchise store in australia 
during fiscal we invested in lululemon athletica australia pty ltd 
which operates five franchise stores 
in  we opened a franchise store in japan 
in  we terminated our franchise arrangement and entered into a joint venture agreement with japanese apparel company descente ltd  or descente  a global leader in fabric technology  to operate our stores in japan  which were discontinued in fiscal in addition to deriving revenue from sales through our corporate owned stores and our franchises  we also derive other net revenue  which includes the sale of our products directly to wholesale customers  telephone sales to retail customers  including related shipping and handling charges  warehouse sales and sales through a limited number of company operated showrooms 
wholesale customers include select premium yoga studios  health clubs and fitness centers 
telephone sales are taken directly from retail customers through our call center 
warehouse sales are typically held one or more times a year to sell slow moving inventory or inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices 
our showrooms are typically small locations that we open from time to time when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering during select hours 
other net revenue accounted for of total net revenue in fiscal and of total net revenue in fiscal basis of presentation net revenue is comprised of corporate owned store net revenue  which includes sales to customers through corporate owned stores  franchises net revenue  which consists of licensing fees and royalties as well as sales of our products to franchises  and other net revenue  which includes sales to wholesale accounts  telephone sales  warehouse sales and sales from company operated showrooms 
in each case  less returns and discounts 
in addition  we separately track comparable store sales  which reflect net revenue at corporate owned stores that have been open for at least months 
therefore  net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales 
comparable store sales include stores that have been remodeled or relocated 
non comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open for months  sales from showrooms  and sales from stores that were closed within the past months 

table of contents by measuring the change in year over year net revenue in stores that have been open for months or more  comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our core store base is performing 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including the location of new stores relative to existing stores  consumer preferences  buying trends and overall economic trends  our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel  competition  changes in our merchandise mix  pricing  the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events  the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts  the level of customer service that we provide in our stores  our ability to source and distribute products efficiently  and the number of stores we open  close including for temporary renovations and expand in any period 
as we continue our store expansion program  we expect that a greater percentage of our net revenue will come from non comparable store sales 
opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy 
accordingly  comparable store sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable store sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than months 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchased merchandise  inbound freight  duty and non refundable taxes incurred in delivering goods to our distribution centers  the cost of our production  merchandise and design departments including salaries  stock based compensation and benefits  and operating expenses  the cost of occupancy related to store operations such as rent and utilities and the depreciation and amortization related to store level capital expenditures  the cost of our distribution centers such as rent and utilities as well as other fees we pay to third parties to operate our distribution centers and the depreciation and amortization related to our distribution centers  hemming  and shrink and valuation reserves 
cost of goods sold also may change as we open or close stores because of the resulting change in related occupancy costs 
the primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  cost of goods sold included million  million and million  respectively  of charges related to stock based compensation 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold  provision for impairment and lease exit costs and settlement of lawsuit 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include marketing costs  accounting costs  information technology costs  professional fees  corporate facility costs  corporate and store level payroll and benefits expenses including stock based compensation other than the salaries and benefits and stock based compensation for our production  merchandise and design departments included in cost of goods sold and other corporate costs 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses included million  million and million  respectively  of charges related to stock based compensation 
our selling  general and administrative expenses also include depreciation and amortization expense for all assets other than depreciation and amortization expenses related to store level capital expenditures and our distribution centers  each of which are included in cost of goods sold 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store level employees 

table of contents provision for impairment and lease exit costs consists of asset impairments  lease exit and other related costs associated with the closure of one us corporate owned store in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as an asset impairment provision based on management s ongoing evaluation of its portfolio of corporate owned store locations 
long lived assets are reviewed at the store level periodically for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question 
factors used in the evaluation include  but are not limited to  management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
settlement of lawsuit consists of a payment we made in february in the amount of million to a third party website developer arising from the termination of a profit sharing arrangement associated with our retail website for our products 
we accrued for the entire settlement amount in fiscal stock based compensation expense includes charges incurred in recognition of compensation expense associated with grants of stock options  grants of restricted stock units  and stock purchases 
in december  we adopted the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is applicable to stock based awards exchanged for employee services and in certain circumstances for non employee directors 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for both awards granted by us and awards granted under a stockholder sponsored plan 
pursuant to sfas r  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
prior to our initial public offering in july  the fair value of the shares of common stock that underlie the stock options we granted was determined by our board of directors 
our board of directors determined a valuation of lululemon as of april  the valuation was calculated based upon the equity value implied by the december transaction in which mr 
wilson sold of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors for approximately million 
at the time  our board of directors believed the december transaction was a valid indication of fair value because the terms of the december transaction were the result of arms length negotiations among independent parties 
because there had been no public market for our common stock  our board used this valuation to determine the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant of the options 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements necessary for our initial public offering and based in part on discussions with prospective underwriters for the planned offering  in march we reassessed the estimated accounting fair value as of january of common stock in light of the potential completion of the initial public offering 
after reviewing its valuation  our board of directors determined that the valuation would not be appropriate for valuing the options as the valuation did not fully consider requirements under sfas r and other relevant regulatory guidelines  specifically the valuation did not coincide with the option grant dates  and the valuation incorrectly included a minority interest discount 
as a result  management determined that it would be necessary to retrospectively calculate a new valuation for the july option grants 
based upon the reassessment  we determined that the accounting fair value of the options granted to employees from february  to january  was greater than the exercise price for certain of those options 
the comparison of the originally determined fair value and reassessed fair value is as follows for all dates on which an option was granted  assuming that our corporate reorganization had occurred and using the initial public offering price of per share initial original number of public fair value reassessed options exercise offering assessment fair value grant date granted price price of options of options july  december  december  january  based upon the reassessment discussed above  we determined the reassessed accounting fair value of the options to purchase  shares of common stock granted to employees during the period from february  
table of contents to january  ranged from to per share 
as a result of the reassessed fair value of our grants of stock options  the aggregate fair value of our stock options increased by million 
stock based compensation expense for the year ended january  includes the difference between the reassessed accounting fair value per share of the common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price per share and is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options using the straight line method 
there are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the reassessed accounting fair values 
for this and other reasons  the reassessed accounting fair value used to compute the stock based compensation expense may not be reflective of the fair market value that would result from the application of other valuation methods  including accepted valuation methods for tax purposes 
we record our stock based compensation expense in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses as stock based awards have been made to employees whose salaries are classified in both expense categories 
interest income includes interest earned on our cash balances and our advances to franchise 
we expect to continue to generate interest income to the extent that our cash generated from operations exceeds our cash used for investment 
interest expense includes interest costs associated with our credit facilities and with letters of credit drawn under these facilities for the purchase of merchandise 
we have maintained relatively small outstanding balances on our credit facilities and expect to continue to do so 
provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products 
historically we have generated taxable income in canada and we have generated tax losses in the united states 
for periods up to and including the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our losses in the united states 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we earned taxable income in the united states 
during the second quarter of fiscal  after considering a number of factors  including recent taxable income  utilization of previously unrealized nol s  our growth strategy as well as other business and macroeconomic factors  we determined that we would more likely than not realize the benefit of deferred tax assets through future taxable income 
as a result of this analysis  we have recorded deferred tax assets in respect of the united states nol s  foreign tax credits and other deductible temporary differences of million  of which million has been recorded though income tax expense and million through additional paid in capital 
several factors have contributed to our effective tax rate in recent periods being significantly higher than our anticipated long term effective tax rate 
first  in fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we generated losses in the united states which we were unable to offset against our income in canada 
second  in fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we incurred stock based compensation expense of million  million  million and million  respectively  a portion of which were not deductible for tax purposes in canada and the united states during these periods 
the impact of these losses and non deductible expenses on our effective tax rate was exacerbated in fiscal by the payment of a bonus to our principal stockholder in that period 
prior to december our sole stockholder  mr 
wilson  received a bonus payout each year representing a substantial percentage of our earnings before income taxes 
following mr 
wilson s sale of of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors in december we discontinued this practice 
payments of these bonuses therefore were eliminated in fiscal from million in fiscal this payment in fiscal significantly decreased our income before income taxes in this period and accordingly resulted in us realizing a higher effective tax rate in this period as we gave effect to the non deductible nature of the losses and the stock based compensation expenses 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal we anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located outside of canada  the united states and australia  in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly

table of contents on a segment basis  we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses such as corporate employee costs  travel expenses and corporate rent 
for purposes of our management s analysis of our financial results  we have allocated some general product expenses to our corporate owned stores segment 
for example  all expenses related to our production  design  merchandise and distribution departments have been allocated to this segment 
income from operations before general corporate expenses from our corporate owned stores segment increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in corporate owned stores gross profit of million  offset by an increase of million in store employee expenses and an increase of million in other store expenses  our franchises segment decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of franchises income from operations of million included in the comparative period shifting to corporate owned stores income from operations when we acquired three franchise stores in calgary  partially offset by increased franchise income from operations of million from our remaining franchise locations  and our other segment increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenue of million  offset by an increase of million in product costs 
income from operations also includes general corporate expenses 
general corporate expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in corporate employee costs of million  an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  and an increase in other corporate expenses of million  partially offset by a million decrease in professional fees 
other income  net interest income increased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher average cash balances

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  our effective tax rate was compared to in fiscal in both fiscal and fiscal  we generated losses in the united states which we were unable to offset against our income in canada for tax purposes 
in fiscal and fiscal  we also incurred stock based compensation expenses of million and million  respectively  a portion of which were not deductible for tax purposes during these periods 
net income net income increased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net income of million in fiscal was a result of an increase in gross profit of million resulting from increased comparable store sales  additional sales from corporate owned stores opened and the strengthening of the average rate for the canadian dollar against the us dollar during the period and the settlement of a lawsuit in fiscal of million  offset by increases in selling  general and administrative expenses of million and an increase of million in provision for income taxes 

table of contents seasonality in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recognized a significant amount of our net revenue in the fourth quarter due to significant increases in sales during the holiday season 
we recognized  and of our full year gross profit in the fourth quarter in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
despite the fact that we have experienced a significant amount of our net revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  we believe that the true extent of the seasonality or cyclical nature of our business may have been overshadowed by our rapid growth to date 
the level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business 
we expect inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the third and fourth quarters in preparation for the holiday selling season 
because our products are sold primarily through our stores  order backlog is not material to our business 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are principally for working capital and capital expenditures  principally the build out cost of new stores  renovations of existing stores  and improvements to our distribution facility and corporate infrastructure 
our need for working capital is seasonal  with the greatest requirements from august through the end of november each year as a result of our inventory build up during this period for our holiday selling season 
historically  our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities  borrowings under our existing and previous revolving credit facilities  and proceeds from equity offerings  including our initial public offering 
as of february   our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents was million and our cash and cash equivalents was million 
the following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating  investing and financing activities for the periods indicated fiscal year ended february  february  january  in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  realized gains and losses on property and equipment  stock based compensation expense and the effect of the changes in non cash working capital items  principally accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased million  to million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the million increase was primarily a result of increased net income as we expanded our store base and a net decrease in the change in other working capital balances  partially offset by a decrease in items not affecting cash 
the net decrease in the change in other working capital balances was primarily due to an increase in accrued liabilities resulting from a provision for impairment and lease exit costs and was partially offset by an increase in the change in inventories as we build up spring and summer inventories for a larger store base 
the decrease in items not affecting cash was primarily due to decreases in excess 
table of contents tax benefits from stock based compensation and deferred income taxes  and was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization related to our increased store base 
depreciation and amortization relate almost entirely to leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  computer hardware and software  equipment and vehicles in our stores and other corporate buildings 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal depreciation for our corporate owned store segment was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation related to corporate activities was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we have not allocated any depreciation to our franchises or other segments as these amounts to date have been immaterial 
investing activities investing activities relate entirely to capital expenditures  investments in and advances to franchises  and acquisitions of franchised stores 
cash used in investing activities increased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase in cash used in investing activities represents an increase in the number of new stores as well as store improvements on a larger store base 
capital expenditures for our corporate owned stores segment were million in fiscal which included million to open corporate owned stores not including three acquired franchise stores  and million in fiscal  which included million to open stores not including three acquired franchise store 
the remaining capital expenditures for our corporate owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment 
capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology 
there were no capital expenditures associated with our franchises and other segments 
investment in and advances to franchises are to lululemon athletica australia pty ltd 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we purchased our franchises in victoria  british columbia and bellevue  washington for million  calgary  alberta for million and portland  oregon for million  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to range between million to million in fiscal  including approximately million for approximately six new stores  approximately million for information technology enhancements and the remainder for ongoing store maintenance and for corporate activities 
this does not include capital expenditures for our internet retail website which we expect to launch in early financing activities financing activities consist primarily of costs related to our initial public offering  cash received on the exercise of stock options and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
cash provided by financing activities decreased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a decrease of million in proceeds from our initial public offering  net of offering costs offset by an increase of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of million and proceeds from exercise of stock options million 
we believe that our cash from operations  proceeds from our initial public offering and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in risk factors 
in addition  we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores  distribution facility  headquarters  or other systems  which we would expect to fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations

the revolving credit facility is also secured by all of our present and after acquired personal property  including all intellectual property and all of the outstanding shares we own in our subsidiaries 
as of february   aside from the letters of credit and guarantees  we had nil in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
contractual obligations and commitments leases 
we lease certain corporate owned store locations  storage spaces  building and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
our leases generally have initial terms of between five and years  and generally can be extended only in five year increments  if at all 
our leases expire at various dates between and  excluding extensions at our option 
a substantial number of our leases for corporate owned store premises include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses  rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives  none of which are reflected in the following table 
most of our leases for corporate owned store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume  the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table 
during the third quarter of fiscal we were released from our contractual obligation related to the new store support center head office location in vancouver  british columbia

additionally  under some of our franchise agreements  we have the ability to repurchase franchises at a price equal to a specified percentage of trailing month sales 
during the year ended january   we and a franchisee mutually terminated our franchise agreement 
the franchisee had commenced operations during the prior year 
we paid the franchisee a negotiated amount of  that was recognized as a loss on the termination of the agreement and charged to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the amount represented compensation for working capital that we abandoned and the return of the initial franchise fee of  
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate the international purchase of merchandise 
we also enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations  including insurance programs and duties related to import purchases 
as of february   letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling million have been issued 
other than these standby letters of credit  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
in addition  we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and  as such  requires the use of judgment 
actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
net revenue is comprised of corporate owned store net revenue  which includes sales to customers through corporate owned stores including stores operated by our majority owned joint venture  franchise licensing fees and royalties as well as sales of products to franchisees  and other net revenue  which includes sales to wholesale accounts  telephone sales  warehouse sales and sales from company operated showrooms  in each case  less returns and discounts 
sales to customers through corporate owned stores are recognized at the point of sale  net of an estimated allowance for sales returns 
franchise licensing fees and royalties are recognized when earned  in accordance with the terms of the franchise license agreements 
royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees sales and recognized when those sales occur 
franchise fee net revenue arising from the sale of a franchise is recognized when the agreement has been signed and all of our substantial obligations have been completed 
other net revenue  generated by sales to wholesale accounts  telephone sales  including related shipping and handling charges  and showroom sales are recognized when those sales occur  net of an estimated allowance for sales returns 
other net revenue related to warehouse sales are recognized when these sales occur 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment 
sales are reported on a net revenue basis  which is computed by deducting from our gross sales the amount of sales taxes  actual product returns received  discounts and an amount established for anticipated sales returns 
our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue 
this allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns  estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events 
consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns 
our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately days after the sale of the merchandise 
for our wholesale sales  we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved 
employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue 
we account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold  and recognizing net revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
we review our gift card liability on an ongoing basis and recognize our estimate of the unredeemed gift card liability on a ratable basis over the estimated period of redemption 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable primarily arise out of sales to wholesale accounts  sales of products and royalties on sales owed to us by our franchises 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable 
this allowance is established based on the specific circumstances associated with the credit risk of the receivable  the size of the accounts receivable balance  aging of accounts receivable balances and our collection history and other relevant information 
the 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a monthly basis 
receivables are charged to the allowance when management believes the account will not be recovered 
inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market 
cost is determined using weighted average costs 
for finished goods and work in process  market is defined as net realizable value  and for raw materials  market is defined as replacement cost 
cost of inventories includes all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight  duty and other landing costs 
during fiscal  we initiated a new purchasing strategy that requires our manufacturers to acquire the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our apparel products 
because we will no longer be required to acquire these raw materials  we expect raw materials and work in process inventories to decline 
we periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete or damaged goods 
the amount of the markdown is equal to the difference between the book cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands  selling prices and market conditions 
in fiscal  we wrote off million of inventory and in fiscal we wrote off million of inventory 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
costs related to software used for internal purposes are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of the statement of position  accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use whereby direct internal and external costs incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized 
all other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease  without consideration of option renewal periods and the estimated useful life of the assets  up to a maximum of five years 
all other property and equipment are amortized using the declining balance method as follows furniture and fixtures computer hardware and software equipment and vehicles we account for asset retirement obligations under fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a required asset retirement obligation aro when such obligation is incurred 
our aros are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which  at the end of a lease  we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement 
at the inception of a lease with such conditions  we record an aro liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation 
the liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management s judgment  including store closing costs  cost inflation rates and discount rates  and is accreted to its projected future value over time 
the capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets 
upon satisfaction of the aro conditions  any difference between the recorded aro liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of earnings 
prior to fiscal these obligations were not material 
we account for lease termination costs under fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
we estimate fair value at the cease use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals  reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property  even where we does not intend to enter into a sublease 
estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions  including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income 
the estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate 
lease exit costs are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs 

table of contents long lived assets 
long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite useful lives  held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition 
impaired assets are recorded at fair value  determined principally by discounting the future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition 
reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in earnings in the period that the impairment is determined 
long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite useful lives  held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value of the asset and fair value less cost to sell 
any write downs to reflect fair value less selling cost is recognized in income when the asset is classified as held for sale 
gains or losses on assets held for sale and asset dispositions are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs 
income taxes 
we follow the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
on february  the company adopted the provisions of financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and management forecasts  including current and proposed tax legislation  current and anticipated taxable income  utilization of previously unrealized non operating loss carry forwards and regulatory reviews of tax filings 
given the judgments and estimates required and the sensitivity of the results to the significant assumptions used  we believe the accounting estimates used in relation to the recognition of deferred income tax assets are subject to measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to a material change if the underlying assumptions change 
we file income tax returns in the united states  canada and various foreign and state jurisdictions 
we are subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in all jurisdictions from our inception to date 
our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense 
at february   we do not have any significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties 
our intercompany transfer pricing policies will be subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions 
although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
goodwill and intangible assets 
intangible assets are recorded at cost 
non competition agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life of five years 
reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of years 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill or indefinite useful live intangible assets might be impaired 
we use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing 
when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair market value 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation using the fair value method as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payments sfas r 
the fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to 
table of contents additional paid in capital 
our calculation of stock based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions  including future forfeitures  stock price volatility  expected life of the options and related tax effects 
prior to our initial public offering  our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on a number of factors  most significantly our implied enterprise value based upon the purchase price of our securities sold in december pursuant to an arms length private placement to a group of private equity investors 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures  such as types of awards  size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
expected volatility of the stock is based on our review of companies we believe of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options  expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and  ultimately  the expense we record 
for awards with service and or performance conditions  the total amount of compensation expense to be recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest 
for awards with performance conditions  we recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period as determined by a range of probability weighted outcomes 
for awards with market and or performance conditions  all compensation expense is recognized if the underlying market or performance conditions are fulfilled 
certain employees are entitled to share based awards from one of our stockholders 
these awards are accounted for as employee compensation expense in accordance with the above noted policies 
we commenced applying sfas r when we introduced share based awards for our employees in the year ended january  recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure various financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
we adopted sfas on february  and did not elect the fair value option for any of its eligible financial assets or liabilities 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly does not require any new fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november   however the fasb has delayed the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the adoption of sfas for financial assets and liabilities in the first two quarters of fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on its financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  business combinations revised sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas and requires the acquirer of a business to recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value 
sfas r also requires transaction costs related to the business combination to be expensed as incurred 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we currently generate a majority of our net revenue in canada 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar 
historically  our operations were based largely in canada 
as of february   we operated stores in canada 
as a result  we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future 
as we recognize net revenue from sales in canada in canadian dollars  and the us dollar has strengthened during fiscal  it has had a negative impact on our canadian operating results upon translation of those results into us dollars for the purposes of consolidation 
however  the loss in net revenue was partially offset by lower cost of sales and lower selling  general and administrative expenses that are generated in canadian dollars 
the depreciation in the relative value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar in fiscal versus fiscal has resulted in lost income from operations of approximately million for fiscal to the extent the ratio between our net revenue generated in canadian dollars increases as compared to our expenses generated in canadian dollars  we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates 
we do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations 
however  in the future  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments  although we have not historically done so 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit 
interest rate risk 
in april  we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with royal bank of canada 
the revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to cdn million 
because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates  if we have a meaningful outstanding balance 
as of february   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility 
we had small outstanding balances under our revolving facility during fiscal as we built inventory and working capital for the holiday selling season  but we do not believe we are significantly exposed to changes in interest rate risk 
we currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future 
however  in the future  if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments  although we have not historically done so 
these may take the form of forward sales contracts  option contracts  and interest rate swaps 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
