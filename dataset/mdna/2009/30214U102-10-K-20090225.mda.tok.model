table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview exponent  inc is a science and engineering consulting firm that provides solutions to complex problems 
our multidisciplinary team of scientists  physicians  engineers  business and regulatory consultants brings together more than different technical disciplines to solve complicated issues facing industry and government today 
our services include analysis of products  people  property  processes and finances related to litigation  product recall  regulatory compliance  research  development and design 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the assumptions  judgments and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting engagements  product sales in our technology development practice  fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities  as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients 
substantially all of our engagements are performed under time and material or fixed price billing arrangements 
on time and material and fixed price projects  revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
for substantially all of our fixed price engagements we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract 
our estimate of total labor hours we expect to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects 
we believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed price contracts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
these judgments and estimates include an assessment of collectibility and  for fixed price engagements  an estimate as to the total effort required to complete the project 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different 
all contracts are subject to review by management  which requires a positive assessment of the collectibility of contract amounts 
if  during the course of the contract  we determine that collection of revenue is not reasonably assured  we do not recognize the revenue until its collection becomes reasonably assured  which in those situations would generally be upon receipt of cash 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client  as well as the credit worthiness of the client 
losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes evident 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total costs of the contract exceeds the total fixed price of the contract 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable and our unbilled work in process 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debts  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions  aging of amounts due and changes in customer payment terms 
as of january   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million

we invest our excess cash in cash equivalents and short term investments 
at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at the end of the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to an increase in net income and a smaller increase in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenues 
during fiscal  accounts receivable increased by million as compared to an increase of million during fiscal the smaller increase in accounts receivable was due to slower revenue growth 
during fiscal  revenue increased by as compared to an increase of during fiscal days sales outstanding increased to days at the end of fiscal as compared to days at the end of fiscal during fiscal  deferred revenues decreased by  as compared to an increase of million during fiscal the large increase during fiscal was due to an increase in pre billed projects

the larger increase in accrued payroll and employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in accrued bonuses driven by a corresponding increase in profitability

the decrease in net cash used in financing activities during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock are primarily related to the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs or strategically acquire professional services firms that are complementary to our business

as of january   invested amounts under the plan of million were recorded as a long term asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exponent is exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average effective maturities auction rate maturity set at date of next auction in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the maximum effective maturity of any issue in our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments is years and the maximum average effective maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed months 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the average effective maturity of our investment portfolio and cash equivalents at january  was years 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we are exposed to liquidity and credit risk associated with a student loan secured auction rate security 
included within our investment portfolio and classified as a long term asset on our balance sheet at january  is one aa rated student loan secured auction rate security with a par value of million 
during the second quarter of  the auction for this security failed 
the issuer has expressed its intent to restructure this security  and the next scheduled auction is in may of we will not have access to these funds until the security is restructured or a future auction is successful 
if the issuer is unable to restructure this security or successfully close future auctions and its credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of this investment through an impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an unrealized loss on our auction rate security of  which is reflected in other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
based on our ability to access our cash and short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash we do not expect any lack of liquidity related to this investment to negatively impact our ability to operate our business as usual 
we are exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
given the limited nature of these operations  we believe that any exposure would be minimal
