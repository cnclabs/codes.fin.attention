critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its financial statements 
management s estimates are generally based on 
table of contents historical experience and various other assumptions that are judged to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that relate to estimates that require a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on the company s results due to changes in the estimate or the use of different estimates that could reasonably have been used 
management believes its critical accounting policies and estimates include its allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable  inventory valuation  accounting for goodwill  and self insurance liabilities 
allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable 
the company maintains valuation allowances based upon the expected collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
the allowances include specific amounts for accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as customer bankruptcies and disputed amounts  allowances to contractual amounts expected to be collected from medicare and other third party insurers  and general allowances for accounts that may become uncollectible 
these allowances are estimated based on a number of factors  including industry trends  current economic conditions  creditworthiness of customers  age of the receivables  changes in customer payment patterns  and historical experience 
at december   the company had accounts and notes receivable of million  net of allowances of million 
an unexpected bankruptcy or other adverse change in the financial condition of a customer could result in increases in these allowances  which could have a material effect on net income 
the company actively manages its accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
inventory valuation 
in order to state inventories at the lower of lifo cost or market  the company maintains an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory based upon the expectation that some inventory will become obsolete and be sold for less than cost or become unsaleable altogether 
the allowance is estimated based on factors such as age of the inventory and historical trends 
at december   the company had inventory of million  net of an allowance of million 
changes in product specifications  customer product preferences or the loss of a customer could result in unanticipated impairment in net realizable value that may have a material impact on cost of goods sold  gross margin and net income 
the company actively manages its inventory levels to minimize the risk of loss 
goodwill 
the company performs an impairment test of its goodwill based on its reporting units as defined in sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis 
in performing the impairment test  the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using valuation techniques which can include multiples of the units earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  present value of expected cash flows  and quoted market prices 
the ebitda multiples are based on an analysis of current market capitalizations and recent acquisition prices of similar companies 
the fair value of each reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value to determine potential impairment 
the company s goodwill totaled million at december  the impairment review required by sfas requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
the application of alternative assumptions  such as different discount rates or ebitda multiples  or the testing for impairment at a different level of organization or under a different organization structure  could produce materially different results 
self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for most employee healthcare  workers compensation and automobile liability costs  however  the company maintains insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits 
the company estimates its liabilities for healthcare costs using current and historical claims data 
liabilities for workers compensation and automobile liability claims are estimated using historical claims data and loss development factors provided by outside actuaries 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of existing claims change or historical trends are not indicative of future trends  then the company may be required to record additional expense or reductions to expense that could be material to the company s financial
