in  the company s aggregate borrowing capacity was maintained 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for will approximate million and that its financial resources and major sources of liquidity  including cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity  will be adequate to meet its operating and capital needs in addition to its financial commitments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents a summary of the company s contractual obligations and payments due by period as of december  in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years short term obligations long term debt operating lease obligations fair value of interest rate swaps interest payments on long term debt total contractual obligations long term debt includes financial service borrowings which is reported in discontinued operations 
the company is party to various interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with the management of borrowing costs 
as of december   the fair value of the company s net position would result in cash payments of million 
future changes in the us interest rate environment would correspondingly affect the fair value and ultimate settlement of the contracts 
the company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against the variability in exchange rates on cash flows and intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   there is million unrealized losses on the company s foreign exchange contracts 
volatility in the future exchange rates between the us dollar and euro and canadian dollar will impact the final settlement of any of these contracts 

table of contents the following table presents a summary of the company s commercial commitments and the notional amount by expiration period in millions notional amount by expiration period less than total year years years financial standby letters of credit performance standby letters of credit purchase obligations guaranteed residual value obligations total commercial commitments financial standby letters of credit largely relate to casualty insurance policies for the company s workers compensation  automobile  general liability and product liability policies 
performance standby letters of credit represent guarantees of performance by foreign subsidiaries that engage in cross border transactions with foreign customers 
purchase obligations relate to commercial chassis 
in limited circumstances  the company guarantees the residual value on vehicles in order to facilitate a sale 
the company believes its risk of loss is low  no losses have been incurred to date 
the inability of the company to enter into these types of arrangements in the future due to unforeseen circumstances is not expected to have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   the company has a liability of approximately million for unrecognized tax benefits refer to note 
due to the uncertainties related these tax matters  the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for this liability 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
the company s policy is to establish  on a quarterly basis  allowances for doubtful accounts based on factors such as historical loss trends  credit quality of the present portfolio  collateral value and general economic conditions 
if the historical loss trend increased or decreased in  the company s operating income would have decreased or increased by million  respectively 
though management considers the valuation of the allowances proper and adequate  changes in the economy and or deterioration of the financial condition of the company s customers could affect the reserve balances required 
inventory reserve the company performs ongoing evaluations to ensure that reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are properly identified and recorded 
the reserve balance includes both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves at are established based on the identification of separately identifiable obsolete products and materials 
general reserves for materials are established based upon formulas which are established by reference to  among other things  the level of current inventory relative to recent usage  estimated scrap value and the level of estimated future usage 
historically  this reserve policy has given a close approximation of the company s experience with 
table of contents excess and obsolete inventory 
the company does not foresee a need to revise its reserve policy in the future 
however  from time to time unusual buying patterns or shifts in demand may cause large movements in the reserve balance 
warranty reserve the company s products generally carry express warranties that provide repairs at no cost to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product sold  but generally extends from six months to five years based on the terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
certain components necessary to manufacture the company s vehicles including chassis  engines and transmissions are covered under an original manufacturers warranty 
such manufacturers warranties are extended directly to end customers 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims at the time of sale based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales 
management reviews these estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates 
infrequently  a material warranty issue can arise which is outside the norm of the company s historical experience  costs related to such issues  if any  are provided for when they become probable and estimable 
the company s warranty costs as a percentage of net sales totaled in  in and in the increase in the rate in is primarily due to increased costs in the fire rescue group 
management believes the reserve recorded at december  is appropriate 
a increase or decrease in the estimated warranty costs in would have decreased or increased operating income by million  respectively 
workers compensation and product liability reserves due to the nature of the products manufactured  the company is subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business 
the company is partially self funded for workers compensation and product liability claims with various retention and excess coverage thresholds 
after the claim is filed  an initial liability is estimated  if any is expected  to resolve the claim 
this liability is periodically updated as more claim facts become known 
the establishment and update of liabilities for unpaid claims  including claims incurred but not reported  is based on the assessment by the company s claim administrator of each claim  an independent actuarial valuation of the nature and severity of total claims and management s estimate 
the company utilizes a third party claims administrator to pay claims  track and evaluate actual claims experience and ensure consistency in the data used in the actuarial valuation 
management believes that the reserve established at december  appropriately reflects the company s risk exposure 
the company has not established a reserve for potential losses resulting from hearing loss litigation see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  if the company is not successful in its defense after exhausting all appellate options  it will record a charge for such claims  to the extent they exceed insurance recoveries  at the appropriate time 
goodwill impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets effective january  sfas no 
also requires the company to test these assets annually for impairment  the company performs this test in the fourth quarter unless impairment indicators arise earlier 
the company continues to amortize definite lived intangible assets over their useful life 
a review for impairment requires judgment in estimated cash flows based upon estimates of future sales  operating income  working capital improvements and capital expenditures 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of the company s reporting units 
if the sum of the expected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is required against the unit s goodwill 
the annual testing conducted in  and did not result in impairment 

table of contents although management believes that the assumptions and estimates used were reasonable  a sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit is performed along with the impairment test 
the analysis indicated that a reduction to earnings before interest and taxes to all future years would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment in any group 
postretirement benefits the company sponsors domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 
the following table summarizes the impact that a change in these assumptions would have on the company s operating income assumption change basis basis point increase point decrease discount rate return on assets employee compensation levels the weighted average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is set by reference to published high quality bond indices 
however  these indices give only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising the indices do not match the projected benefit payment stream of the plan precisely 
for this reason  we also consider the individual characteristics of the plan  such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  when setting the discount rate 
the weighted average discount rate used to measure us pension liabilities increased from in to in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock based compensation expense the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock option awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions  including the company s stock price  expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
for expected volatility  we base the assumption on the historical volatility of the company s common stock 
the expected term of the awards is based on historical data regarding employees option exercise behaviors 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and expectation of dividend payouts 
in addition to the requirement for fair value estimates  sfas no 
r also requires the recording of expense that is net of an anticipated forfeiture rate 
therefore  only expenses associated with awards that are ultimately expected to vest are included in our financial statements 
our forfeiture rate is determined based on our historical option cancellation experience 
we evaluate the black scholes assumptions that we use to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
with respect to the forfeiture rate  we revise the rate if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense related to future stock based payments may differ significantly from estimates recorded in prior periods 
financial market risk management the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate this risk  the company utilizes interest rate swaps and foreign currency options and forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and is not party to leveraged derivatives contracts 

table of contents interest rate risk the company manages its exposure to interest rate movements by targeting a proportionate relationship between fixed rate debt to total debt generally within established percentages of between and 
the company uses funded fixed rate borrowings as well as interest rate swap agreements to balance its overall fixed floating interest rate mix

a basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates in would have increased or decreased interest expense by million  respectively 
foreign exchange rate risk although the majority of our sales  expenses and cash flows are transaction in us dollars  we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro and british pound 
if average annual foreign exchange rates collectively weakened against the us dollar by  our pre tax earnings in would have decreased by million from foreign currency translation 
the company has foreign currency exposures related to buying and selling in currencies other than the local currency in which it operates
