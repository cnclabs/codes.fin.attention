critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which is regularly reviewed  is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable 
the allowance is determined based on historical write off experience and the current retailer environment 
balances over days past due and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability  other balances are considered on an aggregate basis considering the aging of balances 
account balances are written off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
there is no off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
management believes that the risk associated with trade accounts receivable is adequately provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
during the week period ended december   the company recorded reserves of approximately million  of which it utilized million  resulting in an aggregate reserve amount of  as of december  the company reserved  for such items as of december  this amount is included as part of the sales allowance reserve  which is provided in supplemental schedules on page f inventories 
our finished goods inventories at our retail stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we take markdowns due to changes in fashion and style  based on the following factors i supply on hand  ii historical experience and iii our expectations as to future sales 
we do not anticipate any significant change in our markdown strategy that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we believe that our rim provides an inventory valuation  which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
for our avd division  which makes up approximately of total inventory  the raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value  using the first in first out valuation method 
the company ensures that the raw materials  work in process and finished goods are properly valued by taking into account any obsolescence and recording a reserve in accordance with our established policy 

table of contents finite long lived assets 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and exceeds the fair market value 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or underperforming business trends 
the company evaluates finite lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

finite lived assets are evaluated for recoverability in accordance with sfas no 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss  equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset is recognized 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
the company evaluated its finite lived assets during fiscal and and as a result  recorded an impairment charge of million for stores and  for one store  respectively 
the store impaired during fiscal was closed in fiscal goodwill and intangible assets 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
on december  sfas no 
requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the goodwill s impairment 
during fiscal  in connection with the acquisition of avd  the company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company performs impairment testing of its subsidiary avd  which considers the company s fair value to determine whether an impairment charge related to the carrying value of the company s recorded goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary 
this is reevaluated annually during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if necessary 
the company considers many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of the recorded goodwill will be recoverable 
factors used to determine this primarily include declines in stock price and the market capitalization in relation to the book value of the company  discounted projected cash flows of the reporting unit and valuation of companies comparable to the reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the instability of the us economy resulted in the company experiencing significant decreased sales 
in addition  the capital markets volatility resulted in the company stock price declining substantially  causing the company s book value to exceed the market capitalization plus a reasonable control premium 
the company s impairment testing resulted in a fair value that was less than the carrying value of its subsidiary avd 
as a result  cache recorded an impairment charge of approximately million against the carrying value of avd s goodwill for the fiscal year ended december  self insurance 
we are self insured for losses and liabilities related primarily to employee health and welfare claims up to certain thresholds 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends have been insignificant for fiscal  and further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we maintain stop loss insurance coverage which covers us for benefits paid in excess of limits as defined in the plan 

table of contents gift cards  gift certificates and credits 
the company sells gift cards and gift certificates gift cards and issues credits to its customers when merchandise is returned  which do not expire 
the company recognizes sales from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer and income when the likelihood of the gift card and merchandise credit being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage  since the company has determined that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed value to the relevant jurisdiction as abandoned property 
the company determines gift card breakage income based upon historical redemption patterns and the remaining unredeemed percentage at the end of our historical data of years 
historical redemptions of gift cards ranged from in the first quarter to in the fourteenth quarter subsequent to the issue date  resulting in an average of approximately redeemed or unredeemed gift cards over the historical data of years 
we have determined that redemption would be remote based on the fact that  by the fourteenth quarter since issue date  the redemption rate approximated  indicating that the probability of such cards to be redeemed is remote 
as such  we have recorded breakage income based upon this  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis for propriety 
breakage income represents the balance of gift cards  for which the company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
at that time  the company will recognize breakage income for those gift cards 
the company recorded breakage income of   and million during fiscal year ended  and  respectively 
revenue recognition

sales are included under net sales when the merchandise is shipped to the department stores 
mary l 
sales are recorded net of any returns  chargebacks  discounts and allowances 
we also maintain a reserve as a reduction to sales for potential returns  chargebacks  discounts and allowances 
during the week period ended december   the company recorded reserves of approximately million  of which it utilized million  resulting in an aggregate reserve amount of  as of december  the company reserved  for such items as of december  during the second quarter of fiscal  cache introduced a co branded customer credit card program

the issuing bank bears the cost of the reward program and is responsible for the administration and management of the program 
the company also receives from the issuing bank and visa usa inc a sales royalty  which is based on a percentage of net purchases made by cardholders at cache or other businesses 
cache has determined that since it has not incurred any significant or recurring costs in relation to the co branded credit card program the sales royalties earned in connection to the agreement will be recorded under net sales 
the fees that are incurred by the company are cardholder incentives  which are funded from the fees paid by the issuing bank and visa usa inc the amount of sales royalty income recorded was insignificant in fiscal and seasonality 
we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in net sales and operating income 
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including macroeconomics conditions  the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized in years other than fiscal by highest sales during the fourth quarter october  november and december and lowest sales during the third quarter july  august and september 
we believe that historical quarterly trends were disrupted in fiscal by macroeconomic conditions during the second half of the fiscal year 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using applicable tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when tax contingencies become probable  a liability for the contingent amount is estimated based upon the company s best estimation of the potential exposures associated with the timing and amount of deductions  as well as various tax filing positions 
as of december   the company has recorded a  reserve  net of federal benefit for potential tax contingencies 
no such reserves were recorded as of december  effective december   the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model of how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
fin states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based upon its technical merits 
the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
the cumulative effect of adoption of fin did not result in any adjustment in the company s liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
balance at december  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions for tax positions for prior years reductions for tax positions for prior years due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations settlements balance at december  included in the above ending balance are tax positions of  which  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective tax rate 

table of contents the company s continuing practice is to include estimated interest and penalties  if any  in computing the amount that is recognized within income tax expense relating to uncertain income tax positions 
as of december   the company had accrued  of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions  which is included in the  tax contingency noted above 
although the company believes that it has adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than the company s accrued position 
accordingly  the company s provisions on federal  state and local tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
as of december   the company does not believe that its estimates  as otherwise provided for  on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions 
the company had previously reached agreement with the irs and closed the audit of fiscal year  with no change to the tax return 
as for state and local income taxes  with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of net sales weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended december  december  december  operating results net sales cost of sales gross profit store operating expenses general and administrative expenses store exit costs impairment charge operating income loss other income net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss weeks ended december  fiscal compared to weeks ended december  fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  or  below the prior fiscal year 
this reflects million of decreased net sales  as a result of a decrease in comparable store sales  an increase of million of net sales from our mary l 
division  and a decrease of  from our non comparable store sales 
during the first half of fiscal 
table of contents  comparable store sales increased due to a strong customer response to our sportswear assortment and the company s aggressive pricing strategy 
this increase during the first half of fiscal was offset by a decrease during the second half of fiscal  primarily due to the economic crisis  which resulted in a dramatic reduction in mall traffic where cache stores are located coupled with a shift in consumer spending pattern that favored lower priced or discounted merchandise 
the decrease in net sales during fiscal reflected a increase in the number of sales transactions  which was offset by a decrease in average dollars per transactions  we believe primarily due to the economic crisis 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  or  below the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was the combined result of lower net sales  as described above  and decreased gross profit margins 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to from 
this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in markdowns combined with the company s implementation of the new pricing strategy  as compared to the prior fiscal year  and partially due to an increase in operational costs related to our subsidiary avd  which was acquired during the third quarter of fiscal the increase in markdowns was due to the significant deterioration in the united states economic environment during the fourth quarter of fiscal these increased costs were partially offset by savings from increased direct sourcing of merchandise through avd and a decrease in buying expenses  as compared to last year 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  or  below the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  store operating expenses increased to from 
store operating expenses decreased principally due to lower marketing million and payroll million expenses 
a reduction in marketing expense was primarily caused by the company eliminating all branding tv and print efforts in fiscal  along with a reduction in direct mail advertisements mailed to customers 
payroll expenses were reduced due to a cut back in the number of hours allotted to store employees coupled with a reduction in bonus and commission expense  as a result of decreased sales 
the decrease in marketing and payroll expenses were primarily offset by an increase in self insured medical expense  due to an increase in claim payments made to the insurance company and depreciation expense  due to full twelve months of depreciation and amortization on assets purchased towards the latter part of fiscal  assets purchased to enhance our customer service department and installation of second registers at a majority of our stores 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million  a decrease of million or  below the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to from 
general and administrative expenses decreased  primarily due to lower professional fees million and payroll expenses 
professional fees were reduced during fiscal primarily due to lower audit fees during the current fiscal year and the inclusion of nonrecurring legal settlement costs  in the same period last year 
payroll expenses were reduced during fiscal due to the resignation of the company s previous chairman and ceo  as well as the termination of certain employees from the corporate office due to a decline in the business  which resulted from the slow down in the economy 
these decreases were primarily offset by increases in shipping expense  due to shipment of mary l 
products  sales commissions  paid to an agent for the sale of mary l 
products and depreciation expense 
store exit costs 
during fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million million after tax or per diluted share for underperforming stores 
of the underperforming stores  the company has closed six during fiscal and expects to close the remaining stores in early included in the store exit costs is a write down of equipment and leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures in the amount of million  severance accrual of 
table of contents  and lease termination costs of  these costs were offset by the reversal of  of deferred rent accruals

accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
during fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of  for one store  which was closed in january in addition  cache also recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  after tax or per diluted share against goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
other income expense 
other income expense decreased to  from million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to last year 
this decrease was due to a reduction in interest income of million  caused by lower interest rates as well as lower average cash and marketable securities balances  coupled with charges related to interest expense for the note payable recorded in connection with the acquisition of avd 
the reduction in average cash balances was primarily due to the repurchase of the company s common stock 
income taxes 
during fiscal  an income tax benefit of million was recorded as compared to an income tax provision of million in the same period last year 
the income tax benefit was attributable to the operating loss incurred by the company during fiscal  as discussed above 
the effective rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal net income loss 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net loss of million was recorded during fiscal and net income of million was recorded during fiscal  a decrease of million  as compared to the same period last year 
weeks ended december  fiscal compared to weeks ended december  fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  or  below the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in fiscal net sales  as compared to fiscal reflects million reduction in net sales primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales declined in the fourth quarter  which caused comparable store sales for the year to decrease 
the decrease in comparable store sales was primarily due to lower foot traffic in the fourth quarter that resulted from the overall softer economic environment  coupled with management s decision to reduce the frequency and volume of product catalog mailings to the company s customers 
during fiscal  cache mailed approximately million catalogues during fourth quarter whereas in fiscal we mailed approximately million catalogues  a reduction from last year 
the decrease in net sales was also due to the exclusion of lillie rubin business that had been included in fiscal and discontinued during fiscal year and was offset in part by the inclusion of wholesale sales of our recently acquired avd business 
the fiscal sales included million in sales from the former lillie rubin stores 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  or  below the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to from 
this decrease in gross profit was the combined result of lower net sales and an increase in markdowns  which was partially offset by an increase in initial markup as compared to fiscal also reducing gross profit was an increase in freight charges and our production facility costs  which rose and respectively in fiscal  as compared to fiscal this increase was 
table of contents offset by a decrease in our buying costs  which declined in fiscal  as compared to fiscal store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or above the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  store operating expenses increased to from  primarily due to an increase in payroll expense of  an increase in advertising expense of  rising to of net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and an increase in depreciation expense of million rising to of net sales in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal 
the increase in depreciation expense is partially attributable to the increase in new stores  as well as an increase in store remodels 
we anticipate store operating expenses will decrease  as a percent of net sales in future years  as comparable store sales rise in our newer locations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
this increase was primarily attributable to increases in corporate level payroll expense of  professional fees and legal settlements of  and was partially offset by a reduction in freight expense of  as well as a reduction in telephone expense of  due to the implementation of the new store communication system 
store exit costs 
during fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million for store closing costs for the exit of the lillie rubin business 
included in the exit costs was a write down of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for stores in the amount of million  write down of intangibles of  write down of supplies of  severance accrual of  as well as an accrual of million for contractual termination costs negotiated prior to year end 
these costs were partially offset by the reversal of million of deferred rent accruals 
the company closed of the stores as of december  the company closed the last three lillie rubin stores during the first fiscal quarter of fiscal the company did not incur significant additional exit costs upon the closing of these remaining properties 
the reversal in fiscal was due to the company s conversion of one lillie rubin store into a cache store 
other income expense 
other income increased to million from million 
the increase is attributable to a legal settlement award and a landlord reimbursement for a store closing totaling  partially offset by lower interest income of  and interest expense charges of  related to the note payable recorded in connection with the acquisition of avd 
interest income decreased due to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  below the same period last year 
the overall effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the overall effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to an increase in tax free interest from municipal bond investments  in fiscal also contributing to the reduction in effective rate during fiscal was lower taxable income in fiscal several non recurring charges in fiscal  such as stock offering costs and non deductible incentive stock options caused the fiscal tax rate to be higher than our historical tax rate 
we anticipate the fiscal effective tax rate to approximate

as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased to million from million  as compared to the same period last year 
quarterly results and seasonality we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized in years other than fiscal by highest sales during our fourth fiscal quarter october  november and december and lowest sales during our third fiscal quarter july  august and september

during fiscal  cash received by financing activities was million which consisted of net proceeds of million from stock issuances and stock option exercises  as well as excess tax benefits from option exercises of million 
during november  the company reached an agreement with its bank to amend the amount available under the amended revolving credit facility 
pursuant to the amended revolving credit facility  million was available until expiration at november   which was extended to january  on january   the company and bank of america na agreed to extend the line of credit until march   with a reduced credit line of million 
after consideration  given the company s current strong liquidity position and expected liquidity needs  coupled with the onerous terms currently being offered by banks on credit facilities due to the ongoing credit crisis  the company decided not to enter in to a new credit facility at the present time and as such  the existing credit line expired on march  there were no outstanding loans due to bank of america  na  as of the expired date 
the amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a maximum per annum rate equal to the bank s prime rate  which was at december   less

we believe that cash flow from operations and our current available cash will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated new store opening expenses for at least the next months 
if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly or if we should accelerate our store expansion or remodeling program  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates 
in fiscal  we bore the risk in two specific ways 
first  the revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  the statement of income and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had no borrowing under our credit facility  which expired on march  the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are included in cash and equivalents as well as marketable securities on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations
