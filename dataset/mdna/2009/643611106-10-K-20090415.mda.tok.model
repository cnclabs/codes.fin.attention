item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview effective september   the company completed the acquisition of certain entities  mineral interests and related assets through entities named carl e 
smith  inc  a west virginia corporation  two of its affiliates  carl e 
smith petroleum  inc and carl e 
smith real estate  inc and other privately owned related assets collectively cesi 
immediately after the acquisition  all of the acquired entities and assets were merged into carl e 
smith  inc  the name of which was changed to mountaineer state energy  inc mountaineer which became a wholly owned subsidiary of nce 
the assets acquired include producing gas wells  non producing wells and related equipment  mineral leases covering  acres located in athens and meigs counties in ohio as well as calhoun  jackson and roane counties in west virginia 
in addition to the wells and mineral leases  the acquisition included a complex covering approximately acres of land with  square feet of office and storage buildings  an adjacent acres site with a stall horse barn  machinery and equipment in excess of the needs of the gas operation and approximately million in cash 
nce is evaluating the excess equipment and currently plans on selling any excess land and equipment not needed for current or planned future operations 
the entities involved were the subject of bankruptcy proceedings in the southern district of west virginia originally filed in styled in re carl e 
smith  inc  case no 
chapter pending in the united stated bankruptcy court for the southern district of west virginia  which was substantively consolidated with carl e 
smith real estate  inc  case no 
and carl e 
smith petroleum  inc  case no 
the bankruptcy proceedings 
pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings  a subsidiary of nce acquired a claim of an independent third party  and engaged in a bidding contest which resulted in the court awarding nce the bid on august   which was confirmed august   but various documents and instruments confirming the matter were not completed until september  pursuant to the confirmed plan of reorganization  nce paid all existing debt to third parties of approximately million  paid cash of million dollars to certain shareholders and paid or will pay approximately million dollars in fees and bankruptcy related costs 
in addition  the company entered into several agreements in which the company agreed to payout two former shareholders and a family member 
the agreements all provide that bankruptcy administrative costs incurred over  would be reimbursed to nce prior to any payments being made on the notes 
the administrative costs incurred over  were approximately million 
the agreements further provide that nce can reduce the note payments for any amounts that might be recovered by the irs should they choose to audit cesi for period prior to the acquisition 
in the first two similar agreements two shareholders are to receive a total of  less administrative costs noted above 
the company is to make payments to each former shareholder in the amount of  a week for the next years 
the allocation of the administrative costs to each specific agreement is dependent on future events however the company does not anticipate making any cash payments for five years 
the second agreement was in the amount of  and requires the company should make payments equal to of the available cash flow from the acquired entities 
the entire obligation is required to be paid within five years available cash flow is to be determined by nce based upon mountaineer state energy s actual as well as projected cash needs 
nce anticipates that almost all of this obligation will be used to repaid a portion of the reimbursable administrative costs 
the third agreement was in the amount of  and state the company should make payments in the amount of of available funds from the operation of the business under terms similar to the note above 
however  the payments do not begin until the second agreement is fully funded 
the agreement further provides that is be paid within seven years 
the company has evaluated the above notes and after factoring the administrative cost reimbursement and imputing a interest rate has valued the above obligations at  at december  the cash portion of the asset acquisition totaling approximately million dollars was or will be paid from existing working capital held by nce 
no material relationship existed  other than in respect to the transaction  among nce and the various entities or their shareholders 
in the internal revenue service irs commenced an audit of the cesi and its related companies 
this audit was halted in its early stages during which time the justice department began a review and subsequent prosecution of certain individual owners and related individuals of cesi 
it is unknown as to whether  at this point  the irs will choose to renew its audit of the company for any years prior to our acquisition of cesi 
the bankruptcy plan provides that the irs has two years from the approval of the plan of reorganization to complete an audit should it choose to do so 
the bankruptcy code provides certain limitations as to how far back the irs can go in determining any claims against cesi 
we believe that should the irs complete an audit for the years legally available for a claim the irs would find no material adjustments 
further  should the irs be successful in any claims against cesi  any payments made by the company would reduce future payments due the previous owners  per the terms of the acquisition 
certain individuals have filed administrative claims in the bankruptcy court totaling approximately  should any of these claims be successful  any obligation paid by the company would reduce future payments due the previous owners  per the terms of the acquisition 
in the company acquired interests in a significant block of oil and natural gas leases in cleburne county  arkansas covering approximately  net acres 
in the company sold those mineral rights for a gain of approximately million 
as of december   the company leased one independent living community in oregon  with a capacity of residents 
since  the company has owned  leased and operated assisted living and retirement communities throughout the united states 
during that period of time the company has both acquired and sold over seventy communities 
the acquisition and disposition of its real estate assets has been an integral part of the company s business 
during and  the company anticipated acquiring a cable operator cabletel ad 
for the most part  all of its efforts were directed to that acquisition 
in june  the acquisition of cabletel ad was rescinded by the parties and the company received a breakup fee of  after the rescission of the cabletel ad acquisition the company began seeking new acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of the company s accounting policies require the application of judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments and estimates are based upon the company s historical experience  current trends and information available from other sources that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are more significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
oil and gas property accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies may elect to account for their property costs using either the successful efforts or full cost accounting method 
under the successful efforts method  unsuccessful exploratory well costs  as well as all exploratory geological and geophysical costs  are expensed 
under the full cost method  all exploration costs are capitalized  regardless of success 
selection of the oil and gas accounting method can have a significant impact on a company s financial results 
we use the full cost method of accounting and generally pursue acquisitions and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities 
once we incur costs  they are recorded in the depletable pool of proved properties or in unproved properties  collectively  the full cost pool 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we evaluate possible impairment of producing properties when conditions indicate that the properties may be impaired 
such conditions include a significant decline in product prices which we believe to be other than temporary or a significant downward revision in estimated proved reserves for a field or area 
an impairment provision must be recorded to adjust the net book value of the property to its estimated fair value if the net book value exceeds management s estimate of future net cash flows from the property 
the estimated fair value of the property is generally calculated as the discounted present value of future net cash flows 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the latest available proved reserve and production information and management s estimates of future product prices and costs  based on available information such as forward strip prices and industry forecasts and analysis 
the impairment assessment process is primarily dependent upon the estimate of proved reserves 
any overstatement of estimated proved reserve quantities would result in an overstatement of estimated future net cash flows  which could result in an understated assessment of impairment 
the subjectivity and risks associated with estimating proved reserves are discussed under oil and gas reserves below 
prediction of product prices is subjective since prices are largely dependent upon supply and demand resulting from global and national conditions generally beyond our control 
however  management s assessment of product prices for purposes of impairment is consistent with that used in its business plans and investment decisions 
we believe that a sensitivity analysis regarding the effect of changes in assumptions on estimated impairment is impracticable to provide because of the number of assumptions and variables involved which have interdependent effects on the potential outcome 
oil and gas reserves our proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof  including evaluations and extrapolations of well flow rates and reservoir pressure 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
proved reserves  as defined by the financial accounting standards board and adopted by the securities and exchange commission  are limited to reservoir areas that indicate economic producibility through actual production or conclusive formation tests  and generally cannot extend beyond the immediately adjoining undrilled portion 
although improved technology often can identify possible or probable reserves other than by drilling  under current sec rules  these reserves cannot be estimated and disclosed 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of producing properties is computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
while total dd a expense for the life of a property is limited to the property s total cost  proved reserve revisions result in a change in timing of when dd a expense is recognized 
downward revisions of proved reserves result in an acceleration of dd a expense  while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of dd a expense recognition 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows are prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent management s estimated current market value of proved reserves 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable is based on an analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts 
management considers such information as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant  customer or other debtor and the financial condition of the tenant or other debtor 
management s estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change 
deferred tax assets significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the future recoverability of the company s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carry forwards 
at december  the company had a deferred tax asset due to tax deductions available to it in future years 
however  as management could not determine that it was more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax asset would be realized  a valuation allowance was established

revenue for the retirement facility totaled approximately million in as compared to million for operating expenses totaled million for compared to million for in  oil and gas operating costs totaled  and corporate general and administrative expenses increased approximately  primarily due to the administrative costs of the acquisition 
interest income interest income increased approximately  from to due to the increase in the interest bearing loans to affiliates during interest expense interest expense for increased approximately  due primarily to the amount of time debt was owed

gain on sale of assets in the company sold its investment in mineral rights in the fayetteville shale for a gain of approximately million 
in  the company sold a participation in the future cash flow of its retirement community in king city  oregon and recorded a gain of  other income other income increased from  in to  in the increase in is primarily due to cash received from receivables that were previously fully reserved
