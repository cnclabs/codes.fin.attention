we reach our target consumers through multiple channels of distribution supporting more than  retail outlets throughout north america  europe  australia  asia pacific and south america 
our product categories include i mother  infant and toddler products and ii preschool  youth and adult products 
we market a significant portion of our products with licenses from other parties  and we are currently a party to more than license agreements 
sales 
our sales are primarily derived from the sale of mother  infant and toddler products and preschool  youth and adult products  and are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers 
we market our products through a variety of distribution channels  including chain retailers  specialty retailers  wholesalers and oem dealers 
for the years ended december   and  sales to chain retailers comprised  and  respectively  of our net sales 
our products are marketed and distributed primarily in north america  europe  australia  asia pacific and south america 
international sales  defined as sales outside of north america  constituted  and  or our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to increase in local currencies as we expand our geographic reach 
net sales in our international segment increased for the year ended december   which includes a negative impact of related to changes from currency exchange rates 
we expect unfavorable foreign currency rates to have a negative impact on sales  especially in the first half of we derive a significant portion of our sales from some of the world s largest retailers 
our top three customers  target  toys r us babies r us and wal mart  combined accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
over the last three years  each of these three customers accounted for between and of our net sales 
no other customers accounted for more than of the company s net sales in any of the years ended december   or we provide certain customers the option to take delivery of our products in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada  belgium or germany  with credit terms generally ranging from to days  or directly in china with payment made by irrevocable letter of credit or wire transfer 
we generally grant price discounts on direct sales from china resulting in lower gross margins 
however  shipments direct from china lower our distribution and administrative costs  so we believe that our operating income margin is comparable for products delivered in china versus products shipped in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada  belgium or germany 
for the years ended december   and  direct sales from china constituted  and  respectively  of our net sales 
we do not ordinarily sell our products on consignment  and we ordinarily accept returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from us  we may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling such excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions  which are typically evaluated and issued annually 
returns and allowances on an annual basis have ranged from to of our net sales over the last three years

the remainder of our cost of sales primarily includes tooling depreciation  freight in from suppliers  inventory reserves  concept and design expenses  employee compensation  expense related to stock based payment arrangements and  in and  certain recall related items 
our purchases of finished products from chinese manufacturers are primarily denominated in hong kong dollars 
expenses for these manufacturers are primarily denominated in chinese renminbi 
as a result  any material increase in the value of the hong kong dollar or the renminbi relative to the us dollar would increase our expenses  and therefore  could adversely affect our profitability 
additionally  as certain of our foreign subsidiaries purchase inventory  effectively in us dollars  any material increase in the us dollar relative to our foregn subsidiaries local currencies would increase our expenses  and therefore  could adversely affect out profitability 
additionally  if our suppliers experience increased raw materials  labor or other costs  and pass along such cost increases to us through higher prices for finished goods  our cost of sales would increase  and to the extent we are unable to pass such price increases along to our customers  our gross margins would decrease 
for example  increases in the price of zinc  a key component in die cast products  and increased costs in china  primarily for labor  taxes and currency  reduced our gross margins in  and our quarterly gross margins can also be affected by the mix of product that is shipped during each quarter 
our mother  infant and toddler products category has higher sales of non licensed products that carry lower selling prices and gross margins than our preschool  youth and adult products category 
additionally  individual product lines within each category carry gross margins that vary significantly and cause quarterly fluctuations  based on the timing of these individual shipments throughout the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of royalties  employee compensation  advertising and marketing  freight out to customers  sales commissions  expense related to stock based compensation arrangements and  in and  certain recall related items

we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  substantial fluctuations in our quarterly net sales and operating results  which is typical of many companies in our industry 
our business is highly seasonal due to high consumer demand for our products during the year end holiday season 
approximately of our net sales for the three years ended december   were generated in the second half of the year

on november   the company entered into a new credit facility to replace its previous credit facility 
the credit facility is comprised of a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit

applicable margins vary between to on libor borrowings and and on base rate borrowings 
at december   the applicable margins in effect were for libor borrowings and for base rate borrowings 
principal payments on the term loan commence on march   at a rate of million per calendar quarter  with the remaining principal of million due on november  the company is also required to pay a commitment fee which varies between to per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving line of credit 
at december   the commitment fee in effect was per annum 
under the terms of the new credit facility  the company is required to comply with certain financial and non financial covenants 
among other restrictions  the company is restricted in its ability to pay dividends  buy back its stock  incur additional debt and make acquisitions above certain amounts 
the credit facility also includes a clean down provision that limits the maximum amount of borrowings under the revolving line of credit to million for a period of consecutive days during the first four calendar months of the clean down provision limits decrease to million for a period of consecutive days during the first four calendar months of and million for a period of consecutive days during the first four calendar months of on december   the company had million outstanding on this credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants 
as of the date of the filing of this report  the company has met its clean down provision requirement for the year in conjunction with this new credit facility  the company incurred approximately million in financing fees which are included in other non current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december   and are being charged to interest expense under the effective interest rate method in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations through the term of the credit agreement  which is currently november  prior to november   the company had a credit facility  as amended  which was comprised of an million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
the credit facility also provided for an additional million of capacity under the revolving line of credit  which was approved by the lenders upon the company s request in october during the first quarter of  the term loan was repaid and was no longer available for borrowing 
the revolving line of credit was to be available until its maturity on september  a portion of the term loan had an interest rate of  plus applicable margin  through the first three years of the facility 
the remaining term loan and revolving line of credit bore interest  at the company s option  at a base rate or at a libor rate plus applicable margin 
the applicable margin was based on the company s ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non cash expense related to equity awards and varied between and 
the company was also required to pay a commitment fee of to per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving line of credit

amounts borrowed are due on demand  but are generally available for days  bear interest at the bank s prime rate or prevailing funding cost  whichever is higher  and are cross guaranteed by the company 
as of december   there was million outstanding under these credit facilities 
no amounts were outstanding under these credit facilities at december  the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments at december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond long term debt including current portion estimated future interest payments on long term debt minimum guaranteed royalty payments operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations estimated future interest payments on our long term debt were based upon the interest rates in effect at december  and the balance outstanding on the line of credit at december  in february  we announced that our board of directors authorized the adoption of a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
the program was initially authorized for a period of one year 
in october  the board of directors authorized a million increase to the stock repurchase program and extended the timing of this program through december  under this program  shares could be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion  subject to market conditions and other factors 
shares repurchased are held as treasury shares 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased million shares for million under this program 
through december   the company had repurchased an aggregate of million shares for million under the million stock repurchase authorization 
these repurchases were funded with borrowings on the company s previous credit facility and with cash flow from operations 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash on hand and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet anticipated operating needs in due to seasonal increases in demand for our products  our working capital is typically highest during the third and fourth quarters  and our debt levels are highest during the second and third quarters 
although operating activities are expected to provide sufficient cash  any significant future product or property acquisitions  including up front licensing payments  may require additional debt or equity financing 
off balance sheet arrangements the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during any of the years ended december   and critical accounting policies and estimates the company makes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the accounting policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces gross trade receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the company s allowance is based on management s assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical trends  customer payment practices  receivable aging and customer disputes 
the company has purchased credit insurance that covers a portion of its receivables from major customers 
the company will continue to proactively review its credit risks and adjust its customer terms to reflect the current environment 
inventory 
inventory  which consists primarily of finished goods  has been written down for excess quantities and obsolescence  and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost reasonably approximates the first in  first out method and includes all costs necessary to bring inventory to its existing condition and location 
market represents the lower of replacement cost or estimated net realizable value 
inventory write downs are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
the company s management uses estimates to record these write downs based on its review of inventory by product category  length of time on hand  sales projections and order bookings 
changes in public and consumer preferences and demand for product or changes in customer buying patterns and inventory management  as well as discontinuance of products or product lines  could impact the inventory valuation 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
long lived assets have been reviewed for impairment based on statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that an impairment loss be recognized whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs the entity would recognize as an expense when incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets have been reviewed for impairment based on sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this statement  goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but rather tested at least annually for impairment 
the next test for impairment will be as of october   and will be completed in the fourth quarter of the company s management reviews for indicators that might suggest an impairment loss could exist 
testing for impairment requires estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from the use of the assets 
various uncertainties  including changes in consumer preferences  deterioration in the political environment  continued adverse conditions in the capital markets or changes in general economic conditions  could impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
the company adopted sfas no

income taxes 
the company records current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
management considers all available evidence in evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets and records valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets as needed

effective january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
management considers certain tax exposures and all available evidence when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
if the available evidence were to change in the future  an adjustment to the tax related balances may be required 
estimates for such tax contingencies are classified in other current liabilities and other non current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balances sheets 
product recalls 
the company establishes a reserve for product recalls on a product specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable 
facts underlying the recall  including  among others  estimates of retailer inventory returns  consumer replacement costs  shipping costs and fines and penalties are considered when establishing a product recall reserve 
in and  the company also considered additional replacement costs or refunds  donations  notice charges  claims administration  licensor indemnification claims and plaintiffs legal fees related to settlement of the class action lawsuits 
the company s legal costs to defend recall related matters are expensed as incurred 
when facts or circumstances become known that would indicate that the recall reserve is either not sufficient to cover or exceeds the estimated product recall expenses  the reserve is adjusted  as appropriate 
accrued allowances 
the company ordinarily accepts returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from the company  the company may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions  which are typically evaluated and issued annually 
other allowances can also be issued primarily for defective merchandise  volume programs and co op advertising 
all allowances are accrued throughout the year  as sales are recorded 
the allowances are based on the terms of the various programs in effect  however  management also takes into consideration historical trends and specific customer and product information when making its estimates 
for the volume programs  the company generally sets a volume target for the year with each participating customer and issues the discount if the target is achieved 
the allowance for the volume program is accrued throughout the year  and if it becomes clear to management that the target for the participating customer will not be reached  the company will change the estimate for that customer as required 
accrued royalties 
royalties are accrued based on the provisions in licensing agreements for amounts due on net sales during the period  as well as management estimates for additional royalty exposures 
royalties vary by product category and are generally paid on a quarterly basis 
multiple royalties may be paid to various licensors on a single product 
royalty expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

r  share based payment 
the company elected to use the modified prospective application of sfas no 
r for awards issued prior to january  the fair value of stock options granted under the stock incentive plans is estimated on the date of grant based on the black scholes option pricing model 
the company calculates the expected volatility factor using company specific volatility as the company believes that its actual volatility is a good indicator of expected future results 
the company uses historical data to estimate stock option exercise and employee departure behavior in the black scholes option pricing model 
the expected term of stock options granted represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for the period within the contractual term of the stock option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock awards granted under the stock incentive plan is calculated either using the market price on the grant date or the market price on the last day of the reported period
