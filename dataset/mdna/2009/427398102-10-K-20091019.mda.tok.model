we believe the overall prospects for our financial performance continues to be very good 
our backlog remains at high levels while our proposal activity continues to be very active 
the financial performance in fiscal was driven largely by the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets million  employment settlement costs million  contract disputes and claim settlement costs million primarily recorded in our cost of products sold  legal expenses and engineering and manufacturing difficulties on certain contracts  primarily those transitioned from the closure of our farmingdale manufacturing facility 
we have resolved the various technical problems related to these contracts and are fulfilling our obligations to our customers 
substantially all of these costs and expenses that unfavorably impacted our financial performance occurred or were resolved in our fourth quarter 
while there can be no assurances  we believe the business is showing improvement and we are confident that we will continue to successfully work through these challenges 
the operational improvement initiatives that began in fiscal are continuing and are impacting results across our operating units 
we established four improvement objectives across all business units improve cycle time  reduce defects  improve customer satisfaction  and increase herley pride 
we motivated our employees to actively engage in this program and we are pleased with the excitement and participation across our company 
this process improvement culture is taking root in our operations and we expect the success of the program to continue 
however  there are no representations as to future results or performance or that targeted achievements will be realized 
we ended fiscal with a strong backlog  increasing from the start of our fiscal year 
this includes an increase of attributable to the acquisition of eyal 
the overall prospect for new business continues to be promising as proposal activity remains high 
accordingly  we believe we are taking appropriate and aggressive actions to meet the challenges we face and remain optimistic that our performance should continue to improve 
fifty two weeks ended august  and fifty three weeks ended august  net sales for fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales is primarily related to o an increase of approximately million primarily due to the inclusion of eleven months of eyal s revenues since its acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal  o an increase of approximately million  or  at herley lancaster primarily due to improved manufacturing productivity on contract shipments compared to last year s supplier quality and manufacturing throughput issues 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction in net sales of approximately million related to the settlement of a claim with lockheed martin for equitable adjustment for unpriced change orders  o an increase of approximately million  or  at herley new england primarily due to increased bookings on the icap and ea g programs  and o net revenue decreases related to various other programs and products across multiple sites 
domestic and foreign sales were and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal versus and  respectively  in the prior fiscal year 
bookings were approximately million  of which were domestic and were foreign 
this compares to bookings of approximately million in the prior year period  of which were domestic and were foreign 
gross profit in fiscal was million gross profit margin compared to million gross profit margin in fiscal  a decrease of million 
contributing to the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage during fiscal are primarily the following o herley lancaster experienced certain unfavorable  non recurring expenses including an approximately million write off of certain inventory associated with the settlement of litigation with a customer  approximately million adjustment to net sales and expenses of million associated with the settlement of an outstanding claim for equitable adjustment with lockheed martin and unfavorable inventory obsolescence and related adjustments of approximately million  partially offset by the an estimated favorable variable contribution margin of approximately million related to the incremental revenue increase  o offsetting the overall gross profit decrease was the inclusion of approximately million representing eleven months of eyal s operating results since its acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal  and o product mix of contracts both domestically and internationally 
selling and administrative s a expenses for fiscal were million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the million increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million due to the inclusion of eleven months of eyal s expenses since its acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal  partially offset by a gain on the sale of certain assets  reductions in certain sales commissions and overall cost reductions 
s a expenses as a percent of sales decreased basis points due to leveraging the cost structure 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we evaluated goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment in our fourth quarter of fiscal we concluded that our goodwill was impaired and recorded a charge to operating results of million 
in addition  we partially impaired the value of a license agreement of approximately million 
the fourth quarter non cash goodwill and partial intangible asset impairments are not fully tax deductible  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the period 
these impairments do not affect our cash position  cash flow from operating activities  credit availability or liquidity and should not have any affect on our future operations 
we had an operating loss from continuing operations during fiscal of million compared to an operating loss of million last year 
the results in fiscal include impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets of million  employment contract settlement costs of million and legal expenses of million  while results in fiscal include litigation settlements of million with the department of justice and million with eads see note a to the consolidated financial statements  as well as related legal expenses of million 
in addition  fiscal operating results were further adversely impacted by costs associated with the transition of the farmingdale manufacturing operation including related contract losses of approximately million  abandonment of fixed assets of approximately million and inventory write offs of approximately million  additional inventory adjustments and obsolescence reserves of approximately million and the settlement of certain litigation and other claims of approximately million 
excluding these non recurring or unusual costs  the comparative operating results would have been better than last year primarily due to the increase in sales volume 
interest income was million  decreasing million in fiscal due to lower average cash balances through portions of the year and an overall decrease in rates 
interest expense was million  increasing million over last year primarily attributable to the incremental debt incurred from the eyal acquisition 
we recognized a net foreign exchange loss of million in fiscal year compared to million last year 
foreign exchange losses and gains are attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency of our us subsidiary primarily in connection with temporary advances we have made to them in us dollars 
the benefit for income taxes from continuing operations for fiscal was million representing an effective income tax benefit rate of  compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of in fiscal the benefit is less than the statutory rate of primarily due to the unfavorable effect of a portion of the goodwill impairment that is not deductible for tax purposes  the benefit of research and development credits  as well as the estimated benefit of state net operating losses 
basic and diluted loss per common share for fiscal were both compared to

the poor financial performance in fiscal was driven largely by litigation and related settlement costs  as well as engineering and manufacturing difficulties on a number of significant and important contracts  including development contracts 
fifty three weeks ended august  and fifty two weeks ended july  net sales for fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in net sales is primarily related to o delays in key microwave development and production programs at herley farmingdale of approximately million  o a decrease of approximately million as certain commercial programs ended and the transition towards military business progressed at herley cti  o a decrease of approximately million at our herley medical products division related to the timing of capital purchasing requirements at two key commercial customers  and o disruptions across several production programs due to supplier quality issues 
partially offsetting these decreases was o an increase of approximately million of simulation systems and other product sales through micro systems  inc  o an increase of approximately million at herley new england due to volume of certain key second generation production programs  and o an overall increase on various programs and products across multiple sites 
domestic and foreign sales were and respectively of net sales in fiscal versus and  respectively  in the prior fiscal year 
bookings were approximately million  of which were domestic and were foreign 
this compares to bookings of approximately million in the prior year period  of which were domestic and were foreign 
gross profit in fiscal was million gross profit margin compared to million gross profit margin in fiscal  representing a decrease of million 
contributing to the reduction in gross profit during fiscal are the following items o higher independent research and development costs of approximately million on investments in certain strategic opportunities at several herley operations  o approximately million in contract losses recognized on two development and production contracts at herley farmingdale  o higher costs at our israeli subsidiary due to the unfavorable exchange rate of the us dollar versus the new israeli shekel reduced gross profit by approximately million  o reduced volume of revenues across several herley operations affected gross profit by approximately million  o approximately million at herley farmingdale due to cost overruns and a change in management s estimate of the recoverability of the costs on future contracts  o disruptions across several production programs due to supplier quality issues  increased costs of production  and o product mix of contracts both domestically and internationally 
selling and administrative expenses in fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal the million increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in representative commissions related largely to our international business 
as of august   we had aggregate claims  related to various legal matters  under our directors and officers insurance policy of approximately million net of a deductible of  and have received partial payments of approximately million 
we entered into an agreement in january with the insurance carrier whereby if it is determined by final decision of an arbitration panel  or by final judgment of a court  or other final decision of a tribunal having jurisdiction thereof  that any amount paid by the insurance carrier was not a loss  as that term is defined in the policy  we would repay to the insurance carrier any such uncovered sums previously advanced to us 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the insurance carrier asserted in a letter their determination that they are not liable for certain of the legal costs incurred by us 
we have responded with a letter  supported by court case citations  that all the submitted costs represent valid claims under the policy and that the insurance company is liable 
however  based on the insurance company s position and generally accepted accounting principles  we are not permitted to record any potential claim for recovery under our insurance policy 
accordingly  the previously recorded receivable of million as of may  was eliminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal including the elimination of the previously recorded receivable of million as discussed in item  legal proceedings  litigation costs were approximately million versus million in fiscal we had an operating loss from continuing operations during fiscal of million compared to operating income of million in fiscal the results of fiscal include both the million settlement of the department of justice litigation and the million settlement of the eads litigation as discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements  as well as related legal expenses of million 
the decrease in operating income before the legal expenses  litigation settlements and employment contract settlement costs is attributable to the reduction in sales volume  the decrease in gross margin as discussed above  and the increase in selling and administrative expenses 
interest income was million  a decrease of million in fiscal because of lower average cash balances through portions of the year 
interest expense was million  a decrease of million versus the prior year 
we recognized a net foreign exchange loss of million in fiscal compared to a foreign exchange transaction gain of million in fiscal the foreign exchange losses and gains are attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency of our uk subsidiary primarily in connection with temporary advances we have made to them in us dollars 
the combined benefit for income taxes from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal was million representing an effective income tax benefit rate of  as compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of in fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal is primarily attributable to the net operating loss for the company for fiscal as compared to overall income for the company in fiscal the benefit exceeds the statutory rate of primarily due to the reversal of fin liabilities of approximately million that are no longer needed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for an earlier tax year in which an uncertain tax position had been taken 
another major component to the benefit was the tax on the non deductible penalty paid as part of the litigation settlement  which reduced the benefit by 
basic and diluted loss per common share for fiscal were both 
compared to basic and diluted earnings per common share of 
each for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  together with existing cash and cash equivalents and our bank line availability will be adequate to finance presently anticipated working capital  capital expenditure requirements and other contractual obligations and to repay our long term debt as it matures 
a significant portion of our revenue for fiscal is expected to be generated from our existing backlog of sales orders 
the funded backlog of orders at august  was approximately million  of which approximately is expected to ship in fiscal all orders included in this backlog are covered by signed contracts or purchase orders 
nevertheless  contracts involving government programs may be terminated at the discretion of the government 
in the event of the cancellation of a significant amount of government contracts included in our backlog  we would be required to rely more heavily on cash balances and our existing credit facility to fund our operations 
we are not aware of any events which are reasonably likely to result in any cancellation of our government contracts  nor does our historical experience with the government indicate any reasonable likelihood of such cancellations 
a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of historical net sales and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of sales for the foreseeable future 
approximately and of total net sales from continuing operations for fiscal were made to northrop grumman corporation and to lockheed martin corporation  respectively 
future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of our largest customers and our relationship with them 
orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially 
the loss of all or a portion of the sales volume from any one of these customers would have an adverse affect on our liquidity and operations 
as is customary in the defense industry  inventory is partially financed by progress payments 
in addition  it is customary for us to receive advanced payments from customers on major contracts at the time a contract is entered into 
the unliquidated balance of progress payments was approximately million at august  and million at august  the balance of advanced payments was approximately million at august  and million at august  the fiscal increase relates to the timing of payments pursuant to the terms of various contracts 
as of august   we have approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million available under our bank credit facility  net of outstanding stand by letters of credit of million 
as of august  and august   working capital was million and million  respectively  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to and to  respectively 
net cash provided by operations during fiscal was approximately million as compared to net cash used in operations of million in the prior year  a net operating cash flow increase of approximately million 
we had a net loss in the current fiscal year of million versus a loss of million in the prior year 
fiscal was impacted by the non cash impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets of million  additional employment settlement costs of approximately million  none of which were paid in fiscal as discussed in note i to the consolidated financial statements  as well as the settlement costs of various litigation  claims and related expenses of approximately million  for which we expect to make final net cash payments of million in the first quarter of fiscal as discussed in note f to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal included the settlement costs of various litigation and related expenses of approximately million  including cash payments of million in fiscal as discussed in note f to the consolidated financial statements 
other significant changes in net cash from operating activities during fiscal include o the receipt of refundable income taxes of approximately million  o a reduction in cost incurred and income recognized in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of approximately million due to the shipment and billing of contracts on percentage of completion  o the receipt of cash advances  net of liquidations  aggregating approximately million on the contracts noted above  o an increase in inventories of approximately million primarily from the purchase of materials related to the higher level of backlog  o an increase in trade accounts receivable of approximately million primarily due to the increased sales volume  o an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million primarily as a result of the timing of purchases  o an accelerated and final payment related to a prior employment settlement of million due to a change in control  as defined  and o a payment on the eads litigation settlement of million 
as of august   we have available net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax reporting purposes of approximately million  net of carryback  and available net operating loss carry forwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million  with expiration dates through as a result  we do not expect to make cash payments for federal or state income taxes in fiscal based on our internal projections 
net cash used in investing activities of approximately million were primarily related to the acquisition of eyal for approximately million including acquisition costs of approximately million  net of cash acquired of approximately million and capital expenditures of approximately million 
offsetting these investing uses were proceeds from the sale of ici of million  of which approximately million is being held in escrow as security for certain indemnification obligations 
we expect substantially all of the monies held in escrow to be released to us during the fourth quarter of fiscal net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million includes borrowings under our bank line of credit of approximately million for working capital and borrowings to fund the acquisition of eyal of million under the credit line and million under a new term loan in israel 
partially offsetting these borrowings were payments of approximately million against our outstanding line of credit and approximately million of long term debt  including payments of approximately million on the term loan in israel 
bank line of credit and term loan on april   the company replaced its existing credit facility with a new million revolving credit loan agreement agreement with two banks on an unsecured basis which may be used for general corporate purposes  including business acquisitions and stand by letters of credit 
the agreement requires the payment of interest only on a monthly basis and payment of the outstanding principal balance on march  the company may elect to borrow with interest at the bank s prime rate of interest minus  or the greater of libor plus a margin of or effective may  the margin was at august  
there is a fee of basis points per annum on the unused portion of the credit facility payable quarterly and a fee of per annum on outstanding stand by letters of credit 
stand by letters of credit in the amount of approximately million were outstanding at august  see note f 
if at any time the company s backlog of orders falls below million  the bank may obtain a security interest in eligible accounts receivable  as defined  and if the outstanding advances are greater than of eligible receivables  a lien on all inventories 
funded backlog relating to continuing operations as of august  was approximately million 
there were no borrowings under the line of credit at august  we have approximately million available under our line at august  subsequent to the end of fiscal through the date of this filing  we have net borrowings of approximately million under the line of credit primarily to satisfy certain employment settlements  litigation and related matters see below 
a loan of million was outstanding under the line at august  the agreement contains various financial covenants  including  among other matters  minimum tangible net worth  total liabilities to tangible net worth  debt service coverage and restrictions on other borrowings 
as a result of our settlement of various claims and disputes and our inventory reduction  we did not meet the minimum tangible net worth covenant at august  by approximately million and have obtained a waiver from our bank 
we are in compliance with all other financial covenants at august  in october  we amended our agreement with the bank and expect to be in compliance with all financial covenants through fiscal based on our current business outlook 
however  we could become non compliant with one or more of the financial covenants in the future if there is an unfavorable resolution of our outstanding litigation 
the covenants under the line of credit may affect our ability to undertake additional debt in the future 
on september   in connection with the acquisition of eyal see notes b and h to the consolidated financial statements  we borrowed million under our line of credit and entered into a new term loan term loan in the amount of million through a bank in israel 
the term loan is payable in quarterly installments over a period of ten years  bearing interest at libor plus 
the term loan agreement contains various financial covenants which have been met as of august   including  among other matters  minimum net equity as defined 
we expect to be in compliance with all financial covenants through fiscal based on our business outlook 
the covenants under the term loan primarily affect the israeli business unit and would not significantly affect the company s ability to undertake additional debt  if at all  in the future 
in november  we repaid million on our line of credit from the proceeds of the ici sale 
employment settlements  litigation and related matters also see notes f and i to the consolidated financial statements in july  we entered into a settlement agreement with myron levy  our former chairman and chief executive officer  terminating his employment agreement

in june  a special committee of our board of directors authorized an accelerated payment to lee n 
blatt  former chairman of the company under the terms of his agreement with us dated september  due to a change in control  as defined in the agreement 
the triggering event caused approximately million otherwise payable over the next months to become immediately payable 
we paid that amount in july at august   we had approximately million due from a customer related to claims and unpriced change orders in connection with changes in scope issues under a contract that were in dispute 
in september  we settled this claim for approximately million  less million previously advanced by this customer 
as a result  at august   we recorded a charge of approximately million against our cost of products sold and reduced net sales by approximately million 
we have a receivable due from this customer of approximately million 
in may  we were advised that a contract with herley farmingdale that was included in our backlog at the time in the aggregate amount of approximately million was being terminated for default

there were no shares repurchased under this program in fiscal as of august   we acquired an aggregate of approximately million shares in the open market  all of which have been previously retired 
the timing and amount of share repurchases  if any  will depend on business and market conditions  as well as legal and regulatory considerations  among other things 
dividend policy we have not paid cash dividends in the company s history 
our board of directors evaluates our dividend policy based on our financial condition  profitability  cash flow  capital requirements  and the outlook of our business

contractual financial obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements our financial obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts include purchase orders  debt  lease and settlement agreements  and contingent commitments such as stand by letters of credit 
these financial obligations are recorded in accordance with accounting rules applicable to the underlying transaction  with the result that some are recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet  while others are required to be disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis

important accounting practices that require the use of assumptions and judgments are outlined below 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
payments received from customers in advance of products delivered are recorded as customer advance payments until earned 
approximately of our contracts are firm  fixed price contracts  providing for a predetermined fixed price for the products sold  regardless of the costs incurred 
historically approximately of our revenues were derived from long term  fixed price contracts for which revenues and estimated profits are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs to date bear to total estimated contract costs at completion with related cost of sales recorded as costs are incurred 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
selling and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimation process could affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the key assumptions used in the estimate of costs to complete relate to labor costs and indirect costs required to complete the contract 
the estimate of rates and hours as well as the application of overhead costs is reviewed on a regular basis 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported on our financial statements 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the period in which the change is known 
prospective losses on long term contracts are based upon the anticipated excess of costs over the selling price of the remaining units to be delivered and are recorded in the period when first determinable 
actual losses could differ from those estimated due to changes in the final costs and contract terms 
inventories are stated at lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
a valuation allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory is established based upon an aging of raw material components 
current requirements for raw materials are evaluated based on current backlog of orders for products in which the components are used and anticipated future orders 
goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
using a fair value approach applied to our single reporting unit 
impairment charges are recognized for amounts where the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
an annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
any future impairment of goodwill will be charged to operations 
we amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives 
amortizable intangible assets may also be tested for impairment if indications of impairment exist 
impairment testing is performed in two steps i we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of our single reporting unit with our carrying value  and ii if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we performed our annual impairment evaluation required by sfas no 
as of august  we have historically determined our fair value using our current market capitalization  which  in an active market for our common stock  we consider a reasonable indication of implied fair value 
at august   the market capitalization was below our carrying value 
we proceeded to further evaluate our fair value using the income approach and the market approach  as well as a weighted blend of each of the fair value approaches 
based upon these collective analyses  we concluded that there was an indicator of impairment of goodwill as of august  and proceeded to the second step to determine the amount of impairment loss 
such goodwill impairment loss  in the amount of million  was charged to operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal effective august   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective application method 
this standard requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options 
the cost is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the options 
under the modified prospective application method  compensation costs includes a compensation cost of stock options granted prior to but not yet vested as of august  based on grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas and b compensation cost for all options granted subsequent to july  based on grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the new provisions of sfas r 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
our expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life of share based awards is based on observed historical exercise patterns for our employees 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
provisions for federal  foreign  state and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pretax income based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange and changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
since the acquisitions of general microwave corporation and its israeli subsidiary  eyal and ewst  we are subject to movements in foreign currency rate changes related to our operations in israel and in the uk prior to fiscal  the movements in the new israeli shekel versus the us dollar have not been significant 
movements in pounds sterling the functional currency at ewst have been more significant 
for fiscal years   and  herley israel accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
a significant portion of the revenues are derived from dollar denominated contracts 
however  costs at herley israel are largely based in new israeli shekels which exposes us to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the us dollar value of future new israeli shekel denominated costs and earnings 
a strengthening in the average value of new israeli shekels in fiscal  for example  would have increased costs by approximately  and would have increased our consolidated loss from continuing operation before income taxes by approximately  the average  high and low foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year were  and respectively 
a strengthening in the average value of new israeli shekels in fiscal  for example  would have increased costs by approximately  and would have decreased our consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately  the average  high and low foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year were   and  respectively 
for fiscal years  and  ewst accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales based in part on the rate at which ewst s sterling denominated financial statements have been converted into us dollars 
having a portion of our future revenue and income denominated in sterling exposes us to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the us dollar value of future sterling denominated revenue and earnings 
a decline in the average value of sterling in fiscal  for example  would have reduced sales by approximately  and would have decreased our consolidated loss from operations before income taxes by approximately  due to the reduction in the us dollar value of ewst s sales and operating loss 
the average  high and low foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year were  and respectively 
a decline in the average value of sterling in fiscal  for example  would have reduced sales by approximately  and would have decreased our consolidated loss from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately  due to the reduction in the us dollar value of ewst s sales and operating loss 
the average  high and low foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year were  and respectively 
we have made inter company advances to ewst in the aggregate amount of approximately million as of august  since the advances are denominated in us dollars and ewst anticipates reducing the amount of advances during fiscal year  the amount outstanding is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap with a bank pursuant to which it exchanged floating rate interest in connection with the bonds discussed in note h to the consolidated financial statements on a notional amount of  for a fixed rate of for a ten year period ending october  the notional amount reduces each year in tandem with the annual installments due on the bonds 
the fixing of the interest rate for this period offsets our exposure to the uncertainty of floating interest rates on the bonds  and as such has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the hedge is deemed to be highly effective and any ineffectiveness will be recognized in interest expense in the reporting period 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of approximately  as of august  there was no material hedge ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges during the fiscal years presented to be recognized in earnings 
in july  the company negotiated to extend the maturity of its mortgage note to march  with fixed monthly principal and interest installments of  based upon a twenty year amortization including interest at a fixed rate of through march  and at libor plus thereafter at august  
in september  the company entered into a new term loan in the amount of million for a period of years through the company s bank in israel 
the new loan is payable in quarterly installments of  over a period of years with interest at libor plus
