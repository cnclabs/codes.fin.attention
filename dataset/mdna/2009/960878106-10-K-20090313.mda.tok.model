item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are an energy company organized as a delaware corporation in we mine coal  which is used to produce electric power  and we own power generating plants 
we own five mines  which are all located in the united states and supply power plants 
several of these power plants are located adjacent to our mines  and we sell virtually all our coal under multi year contracts 
due to the generally longer duration and terms of our contracts  we enjoy relatively stable demand compared to competitors who sell more of their production on the spot market and under short term contracts 
we sold million tons of coal in  less than of all the coal produced in the united states 
we were the tenth largest coal producer in the united states  ranked by tons of coal mined in in addition to our mining operations  we own the roanoke valley power plants  or rova 
rova consists of two coal fired units with a total generating capacity of megawatts 
rova supplies power pursuant to long term contracts 
results of operations items that affect comparability of results for and each of the prior two years  our results have included restructuring charges and special items that significantly affected net loss 
the pretax income expense components of restructuring charges and special items were as follows in thousands year ended december  interest expense attributable to beneficial conversion feature loss on extinguishment of wml debt loss on extinguishment of rova debt settlement of coal royalty dispute gain on sale of interest in ft 
lupton power project combined benefit fund settlement and interest gain on sale of mineral interests gain on the sale of power operations and maintenance business absaloka mine operating contract termination fee inventory impairment restructuring charges total impact of restructuring charges and special items items recorded in we recorded million of expense related to the beneficial conversion feature in the convertible notes we issued in march  as the conversion price was lower than the fair market value of our common stock at the time of issuance see note for a more detailed discussion 
we refinanced both our wml and rova debt during and as a result recorded losses of million and million  respectively  for the extinguishment of debt see note 
we recorded million in net expense related to two coal royalty claims as we reached an agreement with the us minerals management service and the montana department of revenue to settle two long standing disputes see note 

table of contents on july   we received million for our royalty interest in the gas fired ft 
lupton project and recognized a gain of million on the sale see note 
in  we initiated a restructuring plan in order to reduce the overall cost structure of the company 
as a result  in and we recorded restructuring charges of million and million  respectively 
most of the restructuring charges related to termination benefits  outplacement costs  and lease costs related to the consolidation of corporate office space see note 
items recorded in during  we reached a settlement with the combined benefit fund  or cbf  for the reimbursement of million  plus interest  in past overpayments to the cbf for retiree medical benefits 
we recorded the settlement as a million reduction in heritage health benefit expenses and million in interest income 
in  we sold a royalty interest in a wyoming mine for million 
the sale of the royalty interest resulted in a gain of approximately million 
in  we sold our power operation and maintenance business to north american energy services  or naes  for million 
the sale of the power operation and maintenance business resulted in a gain of million during in  wri reached an agreement to settle its contract disputes with washington group international  inc  or wgi  who had been the contract operator and owner of the mine 
as part of the settlement agreement  wri assumed operation of the absaloka mine and recorded a contract termination fee of million related to the buyout of the wgi operating contract 
later in  we purchased wgi s interest to become the sole owner of wri 
pursuant to our jewett mine s new coal sale agreement with its customer entered into in  we developed a new mine plan 
as a result of the new mine plan  we wrote off million of inventory associated with equipment which will not be utilized under the new mine plan 
items recorded in in  we sold our interests in two coal bed methane leases in southern colorado and recognized a million gain on the sale 
compared to summary our sales increased to million compared with million in this increase was primarily driven by a million increase in our power segment revenues related to an increase in megawatt hours sold and favorable price increases 
our coal segment sales increased by million  as a decrease in tons sold and the impact of decreased prices under our new coal sales contract at our jewett mine were offset by a overall favorable price increase as well as pass through revenues recognized upon the settlement of our coal royalty claims

differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our results 

table of contents special items and restructuring charges in are discussed in items that affect comparability of results 
we do not expect these items to reoccur in  and in addition  we project the following significant variances will occur in in the aggregate  we expect these events will allow us to improve upon both our operating results and our cash flows in we expect our overall tons delivered to decrease from sales tonnages due to anticipated reductions in customer demand and overall economic conditions 
we expect this decrease in tons sold to be offset with cost savings generated by productivity and efficiency improvements  we expect a decrease in our power segment revenues and increased maintenance expenses resulting from a planned maintenance shutdown at one of our rova plants that is required every five years  in may  the fixed capacity payment that we receive for each megawatt hour of electricity that rova produces will step down to a lower rate which continues through the end of the power sales agreement in this decrease will result in a reduction in cash receipts  but will have no impact on our revenues as we begin recognition of previously deferred revenues  we expect our indian coal production tax credit transactions to generate approximately to million of additional earnings and cash flows upon the approval of the private letter ruling by the investor and one of our lenders  we expect an increase in our depreciation expense as a result of increased capital investments made during at our mining operations 
we expect to make additional capital investments during in the range of to million to improve our mining operations and increase productivity 
we expect these capital investments to be funded through our mine s operating cash flows or  if necessary  the mine s existing credit facilities  we expect a decrease in corporate professional fees as we incurred significant expenses in related to our financial statement restatement  we expect a reduction in our repayments of long term debt resulting from the refinancing in of our coal and power debt 
we are not required to make principal payments on our wml debt until  we expect an increase in our restricted investments and bond collateral as we enter new mining areas during and expect to use approximately to million in cash collateral to secure our reclamation bonds  and we expect to have an increase in our required pension plan contributions resulting from the decline in the value of our pension investments and our loan covenants  which require us to maintain a funding status 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our funded pension plans in financial implications of the indian coal production tax credit transactions on october   wri entered into a series of transactions with a financial institution  or investor  designed to enable wri to take advantage of indian coal production tax credits  or ictc s  generated by its mining operations 
in these transactions  wri formed a limited liability company  absaloka coal llc  which it owned jointly with a newly formed subsidiary  wri partners  inc  to mine and sell coal from the absaloka mine 
absaloka coal llc then entered into a sublease from wri of the coal leases from the crow tribe  entitling absaloka coal llc to mine up to million tons of coal at the absaloka mine through wri also assigned to absaloka coal llc all of its contracts to sell coal to third parties 
on october   wri sold its interest in absaloka coal llc to the investor for consideration consisting of an initial payment of million  million of fixed principal and interest payments  and contingent payments based on of the credits allocated to the investor in excess of the fixed payments 
based on current forecasts of the absaloka mine s coal sales  the total consideration to be paid by the investor 
table of contents to wri is projected to be approximately million through december  wri expects to share approximately million of this consideration with the crow tribe as royalties 
we paid a million fee to the crow tribe in the fourth quarter of to secure the tribe s approval of the sublease 
the investor will be entitled to of absaloka coal llc s earnings and related distributions until it has received a return on its initial million cash investment  after which it will receive of earnings and distributions 
on october   wri requested a private letter ruling  or plr  request with the irs concerning various issues relating to the validity of the ictc s 
in march  we received a plr confirming the availability of the ictc s under the specific scenario described whereby we subleased the right to mine a fixed amount of coal from our absaloka mine to the llc 
all payments on the promissory notes and million of the cash received at closing were  or will be  placed into escrow until the approval of the plr by the investor and one of our lenders 
if the plr is deemed unacceptable to the investor or one of our lenders  the transaction is rescinded and all payments made to date will be returned to the investor 
upon approval of the plr and the release of the cash payments from escrow  we will recognize the fixed and contingent payments from the investor as they are received as income in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the initial payment of million and the million fee paid to the crow tribe will be recognized ratably through based on tons sold 
however  until the investor and one of our lenders deem the plr acceptable  income recognition of all proceeds from the investor have been and will continue to be deferred 
as part of the purchase agreement  wri has an option to purchase the investor s entire membership interest after october   and investor is entitled to withdraw at any time from absaloka coal llc 
in these events  or on dissolution of the llc  wri would be required to pay the investor the appraised value of its capital account balance 
wri is the sole manager of absaloka coal llc and has entered into a contract mining agreement with absaloka coal llc under which it receives an amount equal to all of its mining costs plus a fee per ton of coal mined 
westmoreland coal sales company acts as the exclusive sales agent on behalf of absaloka coal llc under a sales agency agreement and receives a fee for its services based on the tons of coal sold 
liquidity and capital resources we have suffered recurring losses from operations  have a working capital deficit and a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about the ability of us to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about the ability of us to continue as a going concern 
the report from our independent registered certified public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   includes an explanatory paragraph reciting these factors that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our subsidiaries  which generally have obtained separate financing 
as a holding company  we have significant cash requirements to fund our ongoing heritage health benefit costs  pension contributions  and corporate overhead expenses 
the principal sources of cash flow to the parent are from distributions from our principal operating subsidiaries 
each of wml  rova and wri has a credit agreement that contains covenants applicable to that subsidiary 
only the wri agreement permits dividends to be paid by wri to us without restriction 
the major factors impacting our liquidity are as follows 
our significant level of debt and limitations under our current debt agreements on the ability of wml and rova to pay dividends to us 
as of december   our total gross indebtedness was approximately million  the principal components of which are million of wml term and other debt  million of 
table of contents rova term debt  million under wri s revolving line of credit  term and other debt  and million of convertible notes 
limitations in the wml and rova debt agreements require the maintenance of reserve accounts and limit the ability of those subsidiaries to distribute funds to us based on changes in reserve account balances and the subsidiaries operating results 
accordingly  these subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends to us in the amounts and in the time periods required for us to pay our heritage health benefit costs  pension contributions and corporate expenses 
ultimately  if our subsidiaries operating cash flows are insufficient to support their operations and provide dividends to us in the amounts and time periods required to pay our expenses  and we are unable to obtain external financing at sufficient levels to pay such obligations  the parent will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due 
our heritage health benefit and pension obligations  which must be funded by distributions from our operating subsidiaries 
our wcc parent company s heritage health benefit costs consist primarily of payments for postretirement medical and workers compensation benefits 
we are also obligated to pay premiums to the combined benefit fund  or cbf 
the most recent actuarial valuations of our postretirement medical benefit obligations  which pertain primarily to former employees who worked in our eastern mines and are guaranteed life time benefits under the federal coal act  indicated that our postretirement medical benefit payments would increase annually through and then decline to zero over the next approximately sixty years as the number of eligible beneficiaries declines 
we also sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our full time employees 
in  we experienced a significant decrease in the value of our pension investments 
after making million of contributions during  the total value of our pension assets still decreased to million at december   as compared to million at december  both the parent company and our subsidiaries will be required to make supplemental pension contributions due to the decrease in the value of our pension investments 
under the covenants of our wml term debt  we are required to ensure that by september of each year  the value of our pension plan assets is at least of our actuarially determined pension liability 
in order to achieve the funding status required by loan covenants  we will be required to contribute approximately million to our funded pension plans during the following table shows the payments we made towards our heritage health benefits and pension obligations in and the expected payments for actual expected payments payments in millions postretirement medical benefits net of subsidy pension contributions cbf premiums workers compensation benefits cash collateral requirements for additional reclamation bonds in new mining areas 
federal and state laws require that we provide bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining 
we must post a bond before we obtain a permit to mine any new area 
these bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis and have become increasingly expensive 
bonding companies are requiring that applicants collateralize increasing portions of their obligations to the bonding company 
in  we paid approximately million in premiums for reclamation bonds and were required to use million in cash to collateralize of the face amount of the new bonds obtained in we anticipate that  as we permit additional areas for our mines in and  
table of contents our bonding requirements will increase significantly and our collateral requirements will increase as well 
any capital that we provide to collateralize our obligations to our bonding companies is not available to support our other business activities 
if the cost of our reclamation bonds continues to increase  our results of operations could be negatively affected 
additionally  if we are unable to obtain additional bonding capacity due to cash flow constraints  we will be unable to begin mining operations in newly permitted areas 
our inability to begin operations in new areas will hamper our ability to efficiently meet our current customer contract deliveries  expand our operations  and maintain or increase our revenues 
liquidity improvements and strategic alternatives in  we took the following steps to improve our liquidity on march   we completed the sale of million in senior secured convertible notes to an existing shareholder  on march   westmoreland partners  our wholly owned subsidiary  completed a refinancing of rova s debt 
the refinancing paid off all outstanding bank borrowings  bond borrowings  and the rova acquisition loan  and eliminated the need for the irrevocable letters of credit  which supported the bond borrowings  on june   wml completed a refinancing of its term debt 
on that date  wml entered into a note purchase agreement with institutional investors under which it sold million of secured notes with principal payments beginning in also on june   wml amended its revolving credit agreement with its lenders and increased the facility to million through we are not required to make principal payments on our wml debt until  on october   wri entered into a series of transactions in order to monetize the indian coal production tax credits available to it 
if the private letter ruling received from the irs on the transactions is approved by the investor and one of our lenders  we could realize net cash flows of up to million before taxes through see note indian coal production tax credits  and on november   wri s million revolving credit facility was extended through november  these steps reduced our consolidated working capital deficit by million from december   to december  the maturities of long term debt and the revolving credit facilities due in are million  of which million relates to the wri revolving credit facilities 
the remaining million due in is payable by our subsidiaries  and is expected to be funded by cash provided by the operations of those subsidiaries 
in addition to these efforts  we are pursuing additional alternatives in our efforts to continue to improve our liquidity during we are in initial discussions with a potential buyer regarding the sale of certain assets  but it is not certain such a sale could be completed in the time required to meet our cash needs  we are pursuing and evaluating potential sale leaseback transactions for certain facilities and equipment at our absaloka mine  we are pursuing alternatives to meet future reclamation bond requirements as we enter new mining areas with reduced amounts of cash collateral  we are attempting to improve our liquidity by improving the operating performance of our mines 
we believe that increases in tons produced and sold  improvements in productivity  and our continued focus on cost control at our mining operations during should improve our liquidity  and 
table of contents we are looking at various alternatives to reduce our required pension contributions  including modifying elections available to us in determining the required contribution  contributing shares of our common stock to the plan in lieu of cash  amending our pension plans  and negotiating revised covenants with our lenders 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing any of the contemplated transactions on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or the other actions we contemplate will be successful in improving our cash flows or our liquidity 
the significant assumptions that underlie the forecasts prepared by us for include the following the private letter ruling received from the irs is approved by the investor and one of our lenders and the ictc monetization transactions proceed in accordance with their terms  our operating cash flow at wri significantly increases over levels as a result of actions taken to improve the operating performance of the mine  wri s revolving line of credit is renewed or refinanced when it matures in november  we are able to defer or reduce our bonding requirements in  and we are able to reduce the cash contributions we are required to make to our pension plans in if our assumptions prove to be accurate  we should have adequate liquidity to meet our currently projected cash requirements through  although by a small margin 
our assumptions are subject to a number of uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  and we may face economic issues that we have not been able to foresee 
however  we anticipate that we will require significant additional capital resources to meet our projected cash requirements for historical sources and uses of cash the following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities years ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash provided by operating activities decreased million in compared to primarily as a result of a million increase in our net loss  which was offset with million of non cash interest expense and million of non cash losses for extinguishment of debt and other than temporary investment impairments 
in  the company s operating cash flows were also negatively impacted by million in severance payments associated with our restructuring plan 
our operating cash flows benefitted from million of cash received from the black lung trust fund and million of cash for a reserve dedication fee from a customer 
cash used in investing activities decreased million in compared to this decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in restricted investments and bond collateral from the rova and wml debt refinancings 
in addition  investing cash flows for included million paid in connection with the acquisition of wgi s minority interest at our absaloka mining operations and our assumption of the mine s operations 
this payment was offset by million of proceeds received from the sale of our royalty interest at our caballo mine 
cash used in financing activities decreased by million in  compared to the decrease is a result of the rova and wml debt refinancings  which primarily represented the long term borrowings in 
table of contents of million  which was offset by million of debt payments 
in  million of long term debt payments were made with only million of corresponding borrowings 
the company s working capital deficit at december   decreased by million to approximately million compared to a million deficit at december  the increase in working capital was primarily a result of the rova and wml debt refinancing which have increased cash and cash equivalents by million and reduced current installments of long term debt by million and amounts outstanding under the company s revolving lines of credit by million 
cash balances and available credit consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december   included in thousands wml rova westmoreland risk management westmoreland coal company parent westmoreland resources  inc total consolidated cash and cash equivalents lines of credit amounts outstanding and availability under the revolving lines of credit of our subsidiaries at december   are as follows in millions total line amounts letters of of credit outstanding credit availability wml wri rova the average borrowings on our million wri revolver during were million 
wml s average balance on its million revolving line of credit was million 
we had no borrowings in on rova s revolver 
the cash and available credit at wml and rova are available to us through quarterly distributions 
however  the loan agreements of wml and rova require debt service accounts and impose timing and other restrictions on the ability of rova and wml to distribute funds to us 
wri can distribute cash drawn from its revolving line of credit to us through dividends 
because the wri loan agreement imposes fewer restrictions on the ability of wri to make distributions to us  wri has been a significant source of liquidity for us 
the cash at westmoreland risk management  our captive insurance subsidiary  is available to us through dividends  subject to maintaining a statutory minimum level of capital 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents information about our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  some of the amounts below are estimates 
we discuss these obligations and commitments elsewhere in this filing 
payments due by period after total in thousands of dollars long term debt obligations principal and interest capital lease obligations principal and interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities totals represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement health benefit plans  defined benefit pension plans  workers compensation liabilities  and mine reclamation costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
postretirement medical benefits and pension obligations our most significant long term obligations are the obligations to provide postretirement medical benefits  pension benefits  workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
we provide these benefits to our current and former employees and their dependents 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
we have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement medical benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans 
these liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in amounts equal to the actuarially determined funded status of the plans 
our obligations for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded 
our pension obligations are required to be funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law and covenants of our loan agreements 
the expense for the year ended december   for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled million  while payments were million 
each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for these items 
our discount rate for postretirement medical and pension benefits are determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model  which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities 
this model is calculated using a yield curve that is developed using the average yield for bonds in the tenth to ninetieth percentiles  which excludes bonds with outlier yields 

table of contents we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations 
our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data 
in addition  we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations 
our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care 
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans 
below we have provided a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the significance of the health care cost trend rate assumptions in relation to reported amounts 
postretirement benefits health care cost trend rate increase decrease in thousands effect on service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation asset retirement obligations  reclamation costs and reserve estimates our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of cost estimates for reclamation of surface land and support facilities at both surface mines and power plants in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit 
asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including  among other items  estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data  estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage  the timing of these cash flows  and a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
as changes in estimates occur such as mine plan revisions  changes in estimated costs  or changes in timing of the reclamation activities  the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted  risk free rate 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different from currently estimated 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities 
asset retirement obligation accretion for the year ended december   was million  and costs incurred totaled million 
see additional information regarding our asset retirement obligations in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our customers have either agreed to reimburse us for reclamation expenditures as they are incurred or have pre funded a portion of the expected reclamation costs 
these funds will serve as sources for use in final reclamation activities and directly reduce our reclamation expenses as we record a receivable for these future receipts 
income taxes and deferred income taxes as of december   we had significant deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets include federal and state regular net operating losses  or nols  alternative minimum tax  or amt  credit carryforwards  indian coal production tax credits  or ictc s  carryforwards  charitable contribution carryforwards  and net deductible reversing temporary differences related to on going differences between book and taxable income 
we believe we will be taxed under the amt system for the foreseeable future due to the significant amount of statutory tax depletion in excess of book depletion expected to be generated by our mining operations 
as a result  we have determined that a valuation allowance is required for all of our regular federal net operating loss carryforwards  amt credit carryforwards  ictc carryforwards and its contributive carryforwards since they are not available to reduce amt income in the future 
in addition  we have determined that since our net deductible temporary differences will not reverse for the foreseeable future  and we are unable to forecast that we will have taxable income when they do reverse  a full valuation allowance is required for these deferred tax assets 

table of contents we have also recorded a full valuation allowance for all but million of our state net operating losses  since we believe that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
no valuation allowance is being provided on million of deferred tax assets because we believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be used to offset fin no 
liabilities presented in the financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries

the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  january  for us 
early adoption is not allowed 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
on january   and will recast prior periods financial statements to show noncontrolling interest minority interest as a separate component of shareholders equity 
we are in the process of determining the effect the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations  which replaces sfas sfas r modifies the principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
this statement also provides guidance for the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination and for determination of required disclosures that will enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination

this fsp clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
concurrent with the adoption of fsp apb  we will be adopting the guidance in eitf  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
eitf was issued june by the fasb and clarifies how to determine whether certain instruments or features are indexed to an entity s own stock 
both the fsp and the eitf are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years january   for us 
we will adopt the provisions of fsp apb and eitf on january   and will be required to retroactively apply 
table of contents their provisions 
upon adoption  we will make an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earning to reclassify from debt to equity the value of the equity component of our convertible notes 
at this time  it is impractical to quantify the effect of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
surety bonds and letters of credit are issued by financial institutions to third parties to assure the performance of our obligations relating to reclamation  workers compensation obligations  postretirement health benefit obligations  and other obligations 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
we use a combination of surety bonds and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation  workers compensation  postretirement health benefit and other obligations as follows as of december  in thousands post workers retirement reclamation compensation health benefit obligations obligations obligations other total surety bonds letters of credit 
table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell commodities principally coal and electric power and purchase commodities principally diesel fuel  coal  steel and electricity 
we produce and sell coal through our subsidiaries wml and westmoreland coal sales company  as well as through our wri subsidiary who subleased the right to mine and sell coal to an affiliated entity  and we produce and sell electricity and steam through our power plant subsidiary 
nearly all of our coal production and all of our electricity and steam production are sold through long term contracts with customers 
these long term contracts reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices 
these contracts typically contain price escalation and adjustment provisions  pursuant to which the price for our coal may be periodically revised 
the price may be adjusted in accordance with changes in broad economic indicators  such as the consumer price index  commodity specific indices  such as the ppi light fuel oils index  and or changes in our actual costs 
contracts may also contain periodic price reopeners or renewal provisions  which give us the opportunity to adjust the price of our coal to reflect developments in the marketplace 
from time to time  we enter into derivative instruments on the notional amount of the contract to manage a portion of our exposure to the price volatility of diesel fuel used in our operations 
in a typical commodity swap agreement  we receive the difference between a fixed price per gallon of diesel fuel and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is greater than the fixed price 
if the fixed price is greater than the index price  we pay the difference on the notional amount of the contract 
at december   we were not a party to any derivative instruments 
interest rate risk we and our subsidiaries are subject to interest rate risk on our debt obligations 
the debt obligations shown in the table below are indexed to either the prime rate or libor 
based on balances outstanding as of december   a change of one percentage point in the prime interest rate or libor would increase or decrease interest expense on an annual basis by the amount shown below in thousands effect of increase or decrease revolving lines of credit wri s term debt rova s term debt the estimated fair values at december   of our long term debt with fixed interest rates are as follows in thousands carrying value fair value practicable to estimate fair value not practicable to estimate fair value it was not practicable to estimate the fair value of our convertible debt as we have not yet obtained or developed the valuation model necessary to make the estimate  and the cost of obtaining an independent valuation appears excessive relative to the materiality of the instrument to us 
the convertible debt has a carrying value of million  an interest rate of per annum and is payable in full on march  at december   the notes are convertible into  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at a conversion price of per share 
our heritage health benefit expenses are also impacted by interest rate changes because postretirement medical benefit  pension  workers compensation  and pneumoconiosis obligations are recorded on a discounted basis
