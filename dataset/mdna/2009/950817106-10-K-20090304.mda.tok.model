item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  beginning on page  for more information about the impact of wes fic s participation in the swiss re contract 
wes fic is also licensed to write direct  or primary insurance business as distinguished from reinsurance in nebraska  utah and iowa  and may write such insurance in the non admitted excess and surplus lines market in several other states  but the volume written to date has been minimal 
in  wes fic purchased of kbs  which writes specialized primary insurance coverage to mostly small and medium sized banks in the midwest 
its product line for financial institutions includes policies for crime insurance  check kiting fraud indemnification  internet banking catastrophe theft 
table of contents insurance  internet banking privacy liability insurance  directors and officers liability  bank employment practices  and bank insurance agents professional errors and omissions indemnity 
kbs has also offered deposit guarantee bonds which insure bank deposits in excess of federally insured limits bonds  and  until recently  accounted for approximately half of its annual premium volume of million 
because of recent events in the banking industry  including a number of bank failures  management is less confident in the long term profitability of this line of insurance than previously 
kbs s customer base consists principally of small midwestern banks  few of which are believed to be subject to significant risk of failure 
however  in the third quarter of one of its customer banks failed  resulting in a loss to kbs  and thus  wesco  of million  after taxes 
in september  kbs notified customers of its decision to exit this line of insurance as rapidly as feasible 
the aggregate face amount of deposit guarantee bonds has been reduced  from billion outstanding at september   to billion at december   and to billion at february   the first date that non renewals and non voluntary cancellations became effective 
the number of institutions that had outstanding kbs bonds fell from  at september   to as of february  kbs is licensed to write business in states  however  in states its insurance has been limited to deposit guarantee bonds 
thus  it is actively writing insurance in states at the present time 
kbs s primary insurance premiums are expected to decrease in future periods 
kbs limits its loss exposure per loss event to a maximum of million  after taxes  by limiting the maximum amount of risk underwritten to million to any single customer or group of affiliated customers  and through the purchase of reinsurance  from the berkshire insurance group  at market prices 
kbs reinsures the entire layer of losses between million and million and of the entire layer above million 
in  premiums of million were ceded to the berkshire insurance group  and million of reinsured losses were allocated to it 
in  premiums of million were ceded to the berkshire insurance group  no reinsured losses were allocated to it  and  of loss reserves  which had been allocated to it in  were reversed 
kbs markets its products in some states through exclusive  commissioned agents  and directly to insureds in other states 
inasmuch as the number of small midwestern banks is declining as the banking industry consolidates  kbs has attributed the ongoing growth in its business to an extraordinary level of service provided by its employees and agents  and to the introduction of new products  such as deposit guarantee bonds which  until kbs decided in late to exit that line of insurance  had grown to represent approximately half of its business 
internet banking catastrophe theft insurance and internet banking privacy liability insurance  which were introduced relatively recently  are steadily increasing in volume  but do not yet provide a significant amount of premium volume 
a significant marketing advantage enjoyed by the berkshire insurance group  including wesco s insurance segment  is the maintenance of exceptional capital strength 
the combined statutory surplus of wesco s insurance businesses totaled approximately billion at december  this capital strength creates opportunities for wes fic to participate in reinsurance and insurance contracts not necessarily available to many of its competitors 
management of wesco believes that an insurer in the reinsurance business must maintain a large net worth in relation to annual premiums in order to remain solvent when called upon to pay claims when a loss occurs 
in this respect  wes fic and kbs are competitively well positioned  inasmuch as their net premiums written for calendar amounted to only of their combined statutory surplus  compared to an industry average of based on figures reported for by am best company  a nationally recognized statistical rating organization for the insurance industry 
standard poor s corporation  in recognition of wes fic s strong competitive position as a member of the berkshire insurance group and its unusual capital strength  has assigned its highest rating  aaa  to wes fic s claims paying ability 
this rating recognizes the commitment of wes fic s management to a disciplined approach to underwriting  conservative reserving  and wes fic s extremely strong capital base 

table of contents insurance companies are subject to regulation by the departments of insurance of the various states in which they write policies as well as the states in which they are domiciled and  in the case of kbs  because of its business of insuring banks  by the department of the treasury 
regulations relate to  among other things  capital requirements  shareholder and policyholder dividend restrictions  reporting requirements  annual audits by independent accountants  periodic regulatory examinations and limitations on the risk exposures that can be retained  as well as the size and types of investments that can be made 
because it is operated by nico  wes fic has no employees of its own 
kbs has employees 
furniture rental segment cort is the nation s largest provider of rental furniture  accessories and related services in the rent to rent as opposed to rent to own segment of the furniture industry 
cort rents high quality furniture to corporate and individual customers who desire flexibility in meeting their temporary office  residential or trade show furnishing needs  and who typically do not seek to own such furniture 
in addition  cort sells previously rented furniture through company owned clearance centers  thereby enabling it to regularly renew its inventory and update styles 
cort s network of facilities in states  the district of columbia and the united kingdom uk comprises showrooms  clearance centers and warehouses  as well as four websites  including www 
cort 
com 
cort s rent to rent business is differentiated from rent to own businesses primarily by the terms of the rental arrangements and the type of customer served 
rent to rent customers generally desire high quality furniture to meet temporary needs  have established credit  and pay on a monthly basis 
typically  these customers do not seek to acquire the property on a permanent basis 
in a typical rent to rent transaction  the customer agrees to rent furniture for a minimum of three months  subject to extension by the customer on a month to month basis 
by contrast  rent to own arrangements are generally made by customers lacking established credit whose objective is the eventual ownership of the property 
these transactions are typically entered into on a month to month basis and may require weekly rental payments 
cort s customer base includes primarily fortune companies  small businesses  professionals  and owners and operators of apartment communities 
cort s management believes its size  national presence  brand awareness  consistently high level of customer service  product quality  breadth of selection  depth and experience of management  and efficient clearance centers have been key contributors to the company s success 
cort offers a wide variety of office and home furnishings  including commercial panel systems  televisions  housewares and accessories 
cort emphasizes its ability to furnish an apartment  home or entire suite of offices with high quality furniture  housewares and accessories in two business days 
cort s objective is to build upon these core competencies and competitive advantages to increase revenues and market share 
key to cort s growth strategies are expanding its commercial customer base  enhancing its ability to capture an increasing number of internet customers through its on line catalog and other web services  making selective acquisitions  and continuing to develop various products and services 
in order to capitalize on the significant profit potential available from longer average rental periods and the higher average monthly rent typically available for office products  cort s strategy is to place greater emphasis on growth in rentals of office furniture while maintaining its premier position in residential furniture rental 
in order to promote longer office lease terms  cort offers lower rates on leases when lease terms exceed six months 
a significant portion of cort s residential furniture rentals are derived from corporate relocations and temporary assignments  as new and transferred employees of cort s corporate customers enter into leases for residential furniture 
thus  cort offers its corporate rental customers a way to reduce the costs of corporate relocation and travel while developing residential business with new and transferred 
table of contents employees 
cort also provides short term rentals for trade shows and conventions 
its www 
corttradeshow 
com website assists in providing information to and gathering leads from prospects 
in january  cort expanded its operations to the uk through the purchase of roomservice group  now doing business as cort business services uk ltd  a small regional provider of furniture rental and relocation services 
in november  cort acquired a business division of aaron rents  inc  expanding its national presence to eleven new markets 
the furniture rental business is dependent on economic growth  and the recent economic contraction has contributed to a weakening of the furniture rental business 
however  cort has continued to make several selective acquisitions since it was purchased by wesco  and it is believed that cort is now better positioned to benefit from job growth and any corresponding economic expansion 
the rent to rent segment of the furniture rental industry is highly competitive 
there are several large regional competitors  as well as a number of smaller regional and local rent to rent competitors 
in addition  numerous retailers offer residential and office furniture under rent to own arrangements 
it is believed that the principal competitive factors in the furniture rental industry are product value  furniture condition  the extent of furniture selection  terms of the rental agreement  speed of delivery  exchange privileges  options to purchase  deposit requirements and customer service 
cort provides a nation wide apartment locator service through its website www 
apartmentsearch 
com  customer call centers  and two walk in locations 
the apartment locator service  which was begun in as cort s relocation central corporation subsidiary and marketed to individuals  has not operated profitably since inception 
in order to trim operating costs  its operations were reorganized and  by yearend  absorbed into cort 
cort s apartment locator service  which was originally intended mainly to lead to increased furniture rentals  now relies more on internet traffic and less on walk in locations 
in consideration of its national presence and expertise in filling a need of the business community  late in cort began marketing its relocation service  designed specifically for renters  to fortune companies as a comprehensive  seamless solution to their employee relocation needs 
in addition to providing rental furniture  cort provides assistance with all aspects of employee rental related relocations  services which include guided city tours  arranging for movers  locating temporary or long term housing  assisting with settling in and other ancillary services 
through its network of foreign contacts  cort also provides such services internationally 
although the relocation business is competitive  it is believed that cort is well positioned to expand these services due not only to its national presence and liquidity  but also because the business reputation of berkshire hathaway gives it entr e to the offices of many prospective customers  and thus a competitive advantage 
the majority of cort s furniture sales revenue is from its clearance center sales 
the remaining furniture sales revenue is derived principally from lease conversions and sales of new furniture 
the sale of previously leased furniture allows cort to control inventory quantities and to maintain inventory quality at showroom level 
on average  furniture is typically sold through the clearance centers three years after its initial purchase 
with respect to sales of furniture through its clearance centers  cort competes with numerous new and used furniture retailers  some of which are larger than cort 
wesco management believes that price and value are cort s principal competitive advantages in this activity 
cort has approximately  full time employees  including union members 
management considers labor relations to be good 
industrial segment precision steel and one of its subsidiaries operate steel service centers in the chicago and charlotte metropolitan areas 
the service centers buy stainless steel  low carbon sheet and strip steel  coated metals  spring steel  brass  phosphor bronze and other metals  cut these metals to order  and sell them to a wide variety of customers 
the service center business is highly competitive 
precision steel s annual sales volume of approximately thousand tons of flat rolled products compares with the domestic steel service industry s annual volume for all shapes of products flat rolled  bar  wire  structural  plate  tubular steel  etc 
of approximately 
table of contents million tons 
precision steel competes not only with other service centers but also with mills that supply metal to service centers  original equipment manufacturers and end users 
sales competition exists in the areas of price  quality  availability and speed of delivery 
because it is willing to sell in relatively small quantities  precision steel has been able to compete in geographic areas distant from its service center facilities 
competitive pressure has been intensified by economic cycles and a shift to production abroad and an increasing tendency of domestic manufacturers to use less costly materials in making parts 
precision brand products  inc precision brand  a wholly owned subsidiary of precision steel that is also located in the chicago area  manufactures shim stock and other toolroom specialty items  and distributes a line of hose clamps and threaded rod 
these products are sold under the precision brand and dupage names nationwide  generally through industrial distributors 
this business is highly competitive  and precision brand s sales represent a very small share of the market 
steel service raw materials are obtained principally from major domestic steel mills 
consolidation and downsizing at the mill level in recent years  combined with generally increasing worldwide demand for certain popular but relatively scarce imported materials  principally the components of stainless steel  have resulted in periods of shortages  chaotically fluctuating availability and prices from the mills  and increased competitive pressures on the steel service business  to which has recently been added the weakening industrial demand resulting from weakening economic conditions 
precision steel s service centers continue to focus on the maintenance of extensive inventories in order to meet customer demand for prompt deliveries  typically  processed metals are delivered to the customer within one or two weeks 
precision brand normally maintains inventories adequate to allow for off the shelf service to customers within hours 
the industrial segment businesses are subject to economic cycles and other factors  but are not dependent on a few large customers 
the backlog of steel service orders decreased to million at december  from million at december  there are full time employees engaged in the industrial segment businesses  of whom are members of unions 
management considers labor relations to be good 
activities not identified with a business segment certain of wesco s activities are not identified with any business segment

item a 
risk factors in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and their financial results elsewhere in this report  we invite your attention to the considerations and risk factors described below 
the risk factors could cause wesco s actual results to differ materially from the forward looking and other statements contained in this report and in the other periodic reports and other filings wesco makes with the sec  as well as in news releases  annual reports and other communications that wesco makes from time to time 
it should be noted that there are other risks facing wesco  and that additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair wesco s business operations 

table of contents an investment in wesco is not an investment in berkshire hathaway 
from time to time there is an erroneous report by an analyst or reporter that an investor wishing to purchase berkshire hathaway common stock can simply purchase shares of wesco stock at a lower price 
berkshire hathaway is the parent of wesco 
wesco s operations differ significantly from those of berkshire hathaway  and its shares may trade at a significantly different price relative to its intrinsic value than do those of berkshire hathaway 
in addition to the risk factors affecting wesco s operations  berkshire hathaway has risk factors of its own 
investors wishing to have investment exposure to berkshire hathaway cannot accomplish this by purchasing wesco shares 
they should carefully read berkshire hathaway s published financial statements and filings with the sec 
wesco s investments are unusually concentrated and fair values are subject to loss in value 
compared to other insurers  wesco s insurance subsidiaries keep an unusually high percentage of their assets in common stocks and diversify their portfolios far less than is conventional 
a significant decline in the general stock market or in the price of major investments may produce a large decrease in wesco s shareholders equity and under certain circumstances may require the recognition of such losses in the statement of earnings 
decreases in values of equity investments could have a material adverse effect on wesco s book value per share 
during  several crises affecting the financial system and capital markets of the us resulted in very large price declines in the general stock market and in wesco s equity securities investments  particularly in the fourth quarter of the aggregate fair value of wesco s investments decreased significantly in and could continue into the future 
wesco s subsidiary  kansas bankers surety company kbs  and therefore  wesco  is exposed to the possibility of losses from bank failures as kbs exits the line of insurance represented by deposit guarantee bonds which insure specific deposits above federally insured limits 
because of recent events in the banking industry  including a number of bank failures  wesco s kansas bankers surety company subsidiary kbs  stopped writing deposit guarantee bonds bonds  which insure specific customer bank deposits above federal insurance limits  and began in september to exit this line of insurance as rapidly as feasible 
the aggregate face amount of outstanding bonds has been reduced  from billion in september  to billion at february   the first date that non renewals and non voluntary cancellations became effective 
it is believed that few of the institutions kbs insures  principally midwestern banks  are facing significant risk of failure  but this could change 
because of aggregate limits as well as its purchase of reinsurance to indemnify itself against significant losses  kbs s exposure to any single bank failure is limited to a maximum of million  after income taxes 
nonetheless  a large number of bank failures for whom kbs has deposit guarantee bond exposure could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of kbs and wesco 
wesco is dependent for its investment and all other capital allocation decisions on a few key people 
investment decisions and all other capital allocation decisions are made for wesco s businesses by charles t 
munger  chairman of the board of directors  president and ceo of wesco  and vice chairman of the board of directors of berkshire hathaway  age  in consultation with warren e 
buffett  chairman of the board of directors and ceo of berkshire hathaway  age if for any reason the services of those key personnel  particularly mr 
buffett  were to become unavailable to wesco  there could be a material adverse effect on wesco 
however  berkshire s board of directors has agreed on a replacement for mr 
buffett should a replacement be needed currently 
its board continually monitors this matter and could alter its current view in the future 
management believes that the succession plan  together with the outstanding managers running wesco s operating units  helps to mitigate this risk 

table of contents wesco s wes fic subsidiary is dependent upon the berkshire insurance group for its management and personnel  and for opportunities to participate with the insurance group in reinsurance contracts representing essentially the entirety of its reinsurance business  as well as a significant portion of its insurance business to date 
since the incorporation of wes fic in  wesco s insurance and reinsurance business  other than that conducted by its kansas bankers surety subsidiary  has been limited principally to participation with members of the berkshire insurance group in contracts for the reinsurance of risks of unaffiliated property and casualty insurance companies 
wes fic s operations are managed by national indemnity company  a member of the berkshire insurance group  it has no employees of its own 
in the event the berkshire insurance group were to cease operating wes fic s business or to significantly curtail wes fic s participation with it in reinsurance contracts  wes fic would be required to look elsewhere for personnel who would conduct and manage its operations  and or seek to continue its insurance business in a different manner  possibly by acquisition 
inasmuch as wesco and its subsidiaries  including wes fic  are also subsidiaries of berkshire hathaway through berkshire hathaway s ownership of wesco  wesco does not foresee a time when berkshire hathaway would not continue operating its insurance business 
wesco s tolerance for risk in its insurance businesses may result in a high degree of volatility in periodic reported earnings 
wes fic participates with members of the berkshire insurance group in certain reinsurance contracts in which significant risk is periodically assumed 
the berkshire insurance group has indicated that it believes that it has been and continues to be willing to assume more risk than any other insurer has knowingly assumed 
as described in item  business  effective january   wes fic entered into a quota share retrocession agreement with national indemnity company nico  a member of the berkshire insurance group  to assume of nico s quota share reinsurance of swiss reinsurance company and its major property casualty affiliates swiss re 
under this retrocession agreement  wes fic has assumed part of nico s quota share reinsurance of all swiss re property casualty risks incepting over the five year period which began january   on the same terms as nico s agreement with swiss re the swiss re contract 
this arrangement significantly increased wes fic s premium volume as well as exposure to large losses  such as hurricanes  and foreign exchange risk  and thus  the potential for increased volatility and losses 
in addition  as with all reinsurance arrangements  wes fic does not control the underwriting of the primary insurer and relies on the primary insurer s reputation and judgment in deciding what underlying risks to insure 
aside from risks assumed under the swiss re contract  wes fic s reinsurance activities currently in force do not subject it to super catastrophe risks 
however  it has procedures in place for the immediate acceptance of participations in catastrophic excess of loss reinsurance  which could subject it to large amounts of losses from mega catastrophes such as hurricanes or earthquakes  if offered to it by the berkshire insurance group  so long as the berkshire insurance group participates in such reinsurance activities to a greater degree 
the tolerance for significant risks may in certain future periods result in significant losses 
this policy may result in a high degree of volatility in wesco s periodic reported earnings 
the degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may result in a high degree of volatility in periodic reported earnings 
in the insurance business  premiums are charged today for promises to pay covered losses in the future 
the principal cost associated with premium revenue is claims 
however  it will literally take decades before all losses that have occurred as of the balance sheet date will be reported and settled 
although wesco believes that loss reserve balances are adequate to cover losses  wesco will not truly know whether the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date 
wesco s objective is to generate underwriting profits over the long term 
estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise 
wesco s reserve estimates are large million at december   so adjustments to reserve estimates can have a material effect on periodic reported earnings 

table of contents each of wesco s operating businesses faces intense competitive pressures 
each of wesco s operating businesses faces intense competitive pressures within its respective markets 
such competition may come from domestic and international operators 
while wesco s businesses are managed with the objective of achieving sustainable growth over the long term through developing and strengthening competitive advantages  many factors  including market changes and technology  could erode or impede those competitive advantages or prevent their strengthening 
accordingly  future operating results will depend to some degree on whether the operating units are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages 
unfavorable economic conditions could hurt wesco s operating businesses 
wesco s operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the economy in general and the industries in which they operate 
to the extent that the current economic recession continues for a prolonged period of time  one or more of wesco s significant operations could be materially harmed 
in addition to the foregoing risk factors inherent in wesco s operations  wesco s shareholders face a market liquidity risk because the daily trading volume of wesco s shares on the american stock exchange is relatively low 
in addition to the risks facing wesco in its business operations  investors wishing to purchase or sell shares of its capital stock face market price risks because the daily amex trading volume of wesco s shares is relatively low 
an order for the purchase or sale of a large number of wesco shares could significantly affect the price at which the order is executed

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in reviewing this item  attention is directed to item  selected financial data  and item  business 
overview the principal goal of wesco s management is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions  nor do fluctuations in annual net income 
to accomplish desired growth  a high priority is placed on the purchases of companies having excellent economic characteristics  run by outstanding managers 
management strives to main high liquidity to ensure that wesco and its subsidiaries are able to endure unforeseen circumstances  including recessionary economic cycles and periods of significant declines in the trading prices of investments  with a 
table of contents margin of safety  and to invest in common stocks of outstanding publicly traded companies at prices deemed reasonable 
in the event that such investments are not available  capital is preserved through investments principally in high quality cash equivalents and securities of the us government and its agencies 
wesco s operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis 
there are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions such as sales  marketing  purchasing  legal or human resources and there is minimal involvement by wesco s management in the day to day business activities of the operating businesses

buffett  chairman and chief executive officer of berkshire hathaway  with respect to wesco s investment decisions  major capital allocations  and the selection of the chief executives to head each of wesco s operating units  subject to ultimate approval of wesco s board of directors 
the operations of wesco s wesco financial insurance company wes fic subsidiary are managed by berkshire hathaway s national indemnity company nico subsidiary 
wes fic participates principally in reinsurance contracts in which nico and other berkshire hathaway insurance subsidiaries participate in the reinsurance of property and casualty risks of unaffiliated insurance companies 
terms of wes fic s participation are essentially identical to those by which the other berkshire hathaway insurance subsidiaries participate  except as to the percentages of participation see item  business  for further information 
financial information relative to these participations appearing in item  selected financial data  and in wesco s consolidated financial statements  is identified as affiliated business 
financial condition wesco continues to have a strong consolidated balance sheet at december   with high liquidity and relatively little debt 
its equity investments are in strong  well known companies  although the trading prices of those investments declined significantly subsequent to year end  as explained below 
the practice of concentrating in a few issues  rather than diversifying  follows the investment philosophy of the chairmen ceos of wesco and its parent  berkshire hathaway  who consult with respect to wesco s investments and major capital allocations 
wesco has no direct investments in subprime loans 
wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion  per share  down million from the billion reported at december  per share 
during  a series of crises occurred in the us financial and capital markets systems  as well as in the credit and housing markets 
these conditions accelerated during the latter half of and into the fourth quarter in particular  into an economic recession  as evidenced by declining consumer confidence  lower consumer spending  bankruptcies and significant job losses 
equity and debt markets have seen major declines on a worldwide basis as well  which have negatively impacted the fair value of wesco s investments 
wesco carries its investments on its consolidated balance sheet at fair value  with net unrealized appreciation or depreciation included as a component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes  without being reflected in earnings 
during  the net after tax unrealized appreciation in fair value of wesco s investments declined by million 
as a result of further declines in market values of wesco s equity securities subsequent to yearend  shareholders equity has declined  by million per share through february  because unrealized appreciation or depreciation is recorded based principally upon market quotations  gains or losses ultimately realized upon sale of investments could differ substantially from recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  as well as notes  and to wesco s accompanying consolidated financial statements  for additional information on wesco s investments 
wesco s liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at december  totaled million versus million at december  the increase related mainly to the retrocession agreement with berkshire hathaway s national indemnity company nico subsidiary  to assume of nico s quota share reinsurance of swiss reinsurance company and its major property casualty affiliates swiss re 
under this retrocession agreement  wes fic has assumed part of nico s quota share 
table of contents reinsurance of all swiss re property casualty risks incepting over the five year period ending december  on the same terms as nico s agreement with swiss re 
the agreement is more fully described in item  business  above 
wesco s consolidated borrowings totaled million at december  versus million at december  these amounts related primarily to a million revolving credit facility used in cort s furniture rental business 
in addition to this recorded debt  wesco and its subsidiaries had million of operating lease and other contractual obligations at december   versus million one year earlier 
see the section on off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations appearing below in this item  as well as note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  for additional information on debt 
wes fic enjoys standard poor s corporation s highest rating  aaa  with respect to its claims paying ability 
results of operations wesco s consolidated net income has fluctuated from year to year  often significantly  as a result of the realization of gains on investments 
the amount  if any  of realized gain or loss in any year has no predictive value and variations in amount from year to year have no practical analytical value 
realized gains amounted to million million  after taxes for and million million  after income taxes for no gains or losses were realized in wesco s reportable business segments are organized in a manner that reflects how wesco s top management views those business activities 
wesco s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations underwriting and investing  and believes that underwriting gain or loss is an important measure of their financial performance 
underwriting gain or loss represents the simple arithmetic difference between the following line items appearing on the consolidated statement of income insurance premiums earned  less insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  and insurance underwriting expenses 
management s goal is to generate underwriting gains over the long term 
underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers  investing is the responsibility of charles t 
munger in consultation with warren e 
buffett  subject to ultimate approval by wesco s board of directors 
accordingly  underwriting results are evaluated without allocation of investment income 
wesco s consolidated net income  excluding realized investment gains  decreased by million for the year  due mainly to hurricane losses and expenses of million  after taxes  recorded in the third quarter of in connection with wes fic s swiss re contract  bank deposit insurance losses of million  after taxes  incurred by kansas bankers surety company in the third quarter of  before its decision to exit this line of insurance  essentially over the next months  and increased operating expenses of the furniture rental business due principally to the expansion of its rental relocation services and the initiation of operations in the united kingdom 
the operations of wesco s subsidiaries have also been impacted generally by the weakening economic conditions  which berkshire and wesco management believe will likely persist through and into before meaningful improvements become evident 
wesco s subsidiaries will continue to take cost reduction actions in response to the current economic situation  including reducing capital expenditures and operating expenses  to partially compensate for the declines in demand for their goods and services 
wesco has historically attempted to manage its financial condition such that it can weather cyclical economic conditions 
management believes that the economic franchises of wesco s business operations will remain intact and that operating results will ultimately return to more normal historic levels 
the consolidated data in the second table in item  above  are set forth essentially in the income statement format customary to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
revenues  including realized net investment gains  are followed by costs and expenses  and a provision for income taxes  to arrive at net income 
the following summary sets forth the after tax contribution to gaap net income of each business segment insurance  furniture rental and industrial as well as activities not considered related 
table of contents to such segments 
realized net investment gains are excluded from segment activities  consistent with the way wesco s management views the business operations

year ended december  insurance segment underwriting investment income furniture rental segment industrial segment nonsegment items other than investment gains realized investment gains consolidated net income in the following sections the data set forth in the foregoing summary on an after tax basis are broken down and discussed 
insurance segment wesco engages principally in reinsurance of property and casualty risks through wesco financial insurance company wes fic 
it also engages in primary insurance through the kansas bankers surety company kbs 
their operations are conducted or supervised by wholly owned subsidiaries of berkshire hathaway  wesco s ultimate parent company 
in reinsurance activities  defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities are assumed 
in primary insurance activities  defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks are assumed 
for purposes of the following discussion  the results have been disaggregated between reinsurance and primary insurance activities 
following is a summary of the insurance segment s underwriting activities 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  insurance premiums written reinsurance primary total insurance premiums earned reinsurance primary total insurance losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses underwriting gain loss  before income taxes reinsurance primary total income taxes underwriting gain loss 
table of contents contractual delays in reporting  and limitations in details reported  by the ceding companies necessitate that estimates be made of reinsurance premiums written and earned  as well as reinsurance losses and expenses 
under the swiss re contract  for example  estimates of premiums  claims and expenses are expected to be reported days after the end of each quarterly period 
estimates are therefore made each reporting period by management for the activity not yet reported 
such estimates are developed by nico based on information publicly available and adjusted for the impact of its  as well as wes fic s management s  assessments of prevailing market conditions and other factors with respect to the underlying reinsured business 
the relative importance of the swiss re contract to wesco s results of operations causes those results to be particularly sensitive to this estimation process 
however  increases or decreases in premiums earned as a result of the estimation process related to the reporting lag will typically be substantially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in claim and expense estimates 
periodic underwriting results can also be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including amounts established for occurrences in prior years 
see the critical accounting policies section of this discussion for information concerning the loss reserve estimation process 
written and earned reinsurance premiums for increased by million and million  over the respective figures  as a result of the inception of the swiss re contract at the beginning of written and earned premiums assumed under the swiss re contract were million and million  respectively 
actual premiums assumed over the remainder of the five year period could vary significantly depending on swiss re s response to market conditions and opportunities that arise over the contract term 
for  written aviation related reinsurance premiums decreased by million  and earned aviation related premiums decreased by million  from those of for  written aviation related premiums decreased by million  but earned aviation related reinsurance premiums increased by million  over the corresponding figures  despite a increase in the level by which wes fic participated in the hull and liability pools in as competition in the aviation risk market has intensified in recent years  the pool manager has continued to exercise underwriting discipline by not writing policies where pricing has been deemed inadequate with respect to risks assumed 
thus  aviation related reinsurance premiums written by the pool manager have declined overall for each of the past several years 
written primary insurance premiums decreased by million for and by million for  from the corresponding prior year figures 
earned primary insurance premiums increased by million for but decreased by million for  as compared with the corresponding prior year figures 
these fluctuations related mainly to kbs s bank deposit guarantee bonds  which insure deposits above fdic limits for specific customers of mainly midwestern banks 
because of recent events in the banking industry  including a number of bank failures  management is less confident in the long term profitability of this line of business than previously 
in september  kbs notified its customers of its decision to exit this line of insurance as rapidly as feasible 
the aggregate face amount of outstanding bonds has been reduced  from billion at september   insuring  separate institutions  to billion at december   and to billion at february   insuring institutions  the first date that non renewals and non voluntary cancellations became effective 
management believes that few of those institutions are facing a significant risk of failure  and through policy limits and reinsurance  kbs has effectively limited its exposure per bank or group of affiliated banks to million  after taxes 
nonetheless  a large number of bank failures for which kbs has deposit guarantee bond exposure could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of kbs and wesco 
because net premiums earned on bank deposit guarantee bonds accounted for of kbs s primary insurance volume for  primary insurance premiums are expected to significantly decrease in future periods 
management believes that underwriting gain or loss is an important measure of financial performance of insurance companies 
when stated as a percentage  the sum of insurance losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses  divided by premiums  gives the combined ratio 
a combined ratio of less than connotes an underwriting profit and a combined ratio of greater than connotes an underwriting loss 
the ratio is figured on a pre tax basis 
underwriting results of wesco s insurance segment have generally 
table of contents been favorable  but have fluctuated from year to year for various reasons  including competitiveness of pricing in terms of premiums charged for risks assumed  and volatility of losses incurred 
reinsurance generated an underwriting loss of million  before taxes  for  due to the inclusion in that figure of the pre tax underwriting loss of million generated by the swiss re contract 
during the third quarter of  hurricanes gustav and ike struck the caribbean and the gulf coast region of the unites states  producing large catastrophe losses for the property casualty insurance industry 
management presently estimates that wes fic s share of swiss re s losses from these events was million  before taxes  although the final figure could vary significantly as additional information becomes known 
the loss estimate was based on management s assessment of publicly available information 
underwriting gains from the aviation related contracts were million  million and million  before taxes  for  and  representing combined ratios of  and  all of which management considers to have been favorable 
these figures reflect the detrimental effects of increasingly competitive pressures  which have resulted in the ongoing softening of prices  in terms of premiums charged for risks assumed  throughout those years 
underwriting results fluctuate from period to period 
the severity component of aviation related losses tends to be volatile  especially with respect to losses incurred during a single reporting period 
had it not been for net favorable reserve development of million in and million in  essentially all of which related to the aviation related contracts  reinsurance activities would have generated underwriting losses of million 
million  after taxes for and million million  after taxes for the underwriting results for included net unfavorable reserve development of million 
million  after taxes  comprised of unfavorable development of million attributable to the aviation related contracts  partially offset by million of favorable development for a contract whose coverage period ended in combined ratios from primary insurance were  and for  and kbs s combined ratios have typically been very favorable 
in  however  pre tax underwriting results deteriorated by million from those of due principally to the establishment of loss reserves with respect to three large claims  principally one for million  net of reinsurance  million  after taxes resulting from the fdic s seizure of a bank  a portion of whose deposits were insured by kbs 
kbs management estimates that it is possible  but not certain  that a portion of that loss may eventually be recovered as the fdic liquidates the bank s assets and distributes funds to the bank s creditors and owners of deposits in excess of fdic limits  including kbs 
recoveries  if any  will be recorded when received 
as noted above  kbs has stopped writing coverage for excess bank deposits and is taking steps to lessen its exposure to losses from bank failures  as rapidly as feasible 
underwriting results from primary insurance for also reflect million of unfavorable loss development  an amount not considered significant 
in  pre tax underwriting results improved by million million  after taxes and included net favorable reserve development of million million  after taxes associated with estimates of losses recorded in several previous years  most notably  the reversal of a million estimated loss recorded in  following a court decision 
underwriting results for included net unfavorable loss development of million million  after taxes  an amount not considered significant 
it should be noted that the profitability of a reinsurance or insurance arrangement is better assessed after all losses and expenses have been realized  perhaps many years after the coverage period  rather than for any given reporting period 
as noted above  because of recent events in the banking industry  including a number of bank failures  management is less confident in the long term profitability of one of kbs s products  deposit guarantee bonds  than previously 
as kbs exits this line of insurance  its loss exposure is declining rapidly 
no other trends have been identified which directly relate to losses  other than the effects from increasing competition  causing declining premium rates  fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  which will affect the underwriting results under the swiss re contract  and the weakening economy  which might result in a decrease in the demand for insurance overall 
losses incurred by wesco s insurance segment  by their very nature  occur unexpectedly and fluctuate from period to period in both 
table of contents frequency and magnitude 
wesco s insurers cede minimal amounts of their direct business  and as a result underwriting results may be volatile 
since september   the insurance industry has been particularly concerned about its exposure to claims resulting from acts of terrorism 
in spite of partial relief provided to the insurance industry by the terrorism risk insurance act  enacted in and amended by the terrorism risk extension act of  and the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of  wes fic is exposed to insurance losses from terrorist events 
wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to such losses from an insurance standpoint cannot be predicted 
management  however  does not believe it likely that  on a worst case basis  wesco s shareholders equity would be severely impacted by future terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
losses from terrorism could  however  significantly impact wesco s periodic reported earnings 
other industry concerns in recent years have included exposures to losses relating to environmental contamination and asbestos 
management currently believes such exposures to be minimal 
following is a summary of investment income produced by wesco s insurance segment in thousands of dollars 
year ended december  investment income  before taxes income taxes investment income  after taxes investment income of the insurance segment comprises dividends and interest earned principally from the investment of shareholder capital including reinvested earnings as well as float principally  premiums received before payment of related claims and expenses which increased in  and is expected to continue to increase  as a result of wes fic s entry into the swiss re contract 
wes fic has redeployed approximately billion  net  of amounts previously invested in cash equivalents and fixed maturity investments  into marketable equity securities since the latter part of in addition  interest rates earned on cash equivalent investments have steadily declined since the latter part of thus  pre tax dividend income earned by the insurance segment increased by million and  interest income decreased by million for  as compared with the corresponding figures 
the million increase in pre tax investment income for reflected a million increase in dividend income  attributable principally to the investment of million  net  in equity securities in the latter part of  partially offset by a decline in interest income resulting mainly from the use of interest bearing cash equivalents and fixed maturity investments for the purchase of the equity securities 
wesco continues to seek to invest in the purchase of businesses and in long term equity holdings 
wesco s insurance subsidiaries  as a matter of practice  maintain liquidity in amounts which exceed by wide margins expected near term requirements for payment of claims and expenses 
as a result  it would be unlikely that any unanticipated payment of claims or expenses would require the liquidation of investments at a loss 
wesco does not attempt to match long term investment maturities to estimated durations of claim liabilities

table of contents furniture rental segment following is a summary of the results of operations of cort business services corporation cort  wesco s furniture rental segment 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  revenues furniture rentals furniture sales service fees cost of rentals  sales and fees selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense income before income taxes income taxes segment net income furniture rental revenues for increased million from those of  after increasing million for from those of excluding rental revenues from trade shows and locations not in operation throughout each year  rental revenues for decreased from those of  following a decrease of approximately in the preceding year 
the number of furniture leases outstanding at yearend  excluding leases acquired from aaron rents  inc aaron discussed in item  business  declined during  after having declined by in  from those of the previous year  following a trend that was established late in growth in the furniture rental business is closely tied to periods of economic expansion  and in this recent period of economic contraction cort has relied principally on price increases  an increase in tradeshow demand  and acquisitions for its revenue growth 
furniture sales revenues for were relatively unchanged from those of  following a decrease of million in from those of the decreases from the level attained in are believed to be attributed principally to the continued softening of the housing market that has contributed to an industry wide decline in retail furniture sales 
service fees for increased million from those of  after increasing million in from those of traditionally  the furniture rental segment has concentrated the marketing efforts of its relocation services towards individual residential customers 
late in  cort began a new initiative to expand the variety of its relocation services  and it redirected the thrust of this activity toward providing these services to corporate relocation departments for their relocating employees in need of temporary or longer term housing 
service fee revenues remain disappointing 
cost of rentals  sales and fees amounted to of revenues for  versus for  and for costs as a percentage of revenues increased in primarily due to higher depreciation expense on recently acquired rental furniture and an increase in inventory write offs related to an effort to improve the overall quality of the rental furniture inventory 
the decrease in costs as a percentage of revenues for was due principally to improvements in revenue mix  with a larger percentage of revenue in attributable to furniture rentals  which has a higher margin than furniture sales 
selling  general  administrative and interest expenses operating expenses for the segment were million for  up from the million incurred for  following an increase of from the million incurred for the increase in operating expenses for was due principally to the incremental costs associated with the business acquisitions in and the costs associated with the 
table of contents business growth initiatives in rental relocation services  the latter of which was the principal cause of the increase in operating expenses for in light of the weakening economic environment  management is aggressively seeking to reduce operating expenses 
income before income taxes for the furniture rental segment amounted to million in  versus million in  and million in the and decreases in pre tax operating results for and  respectively  were principally attributable to the significant increases in year to year operating expenses 
industrial segment following is a summary of the results of operations of the industrial segment  consisting of the businesses of precision steel and its subsidiaries 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services cost of sales and services selling  general and administrative expenses income before income taxes income taxes segment net income the operations of the industrial segment have suffered a variety of ongoing difficulties for a number of years  including periodic economic downturns  a shift of production by many customers from domestic to overseas facilities  resulting in a decline in the number of orders placed and a trend towards smaller sized orders  unprecedented ability of the major steel producers in recent years to raise prices and establish minimum order quantities following consolidation in the industry  periods of intensified competitive pressures for product from suppliers  and intensifying competitive pressures among service centers for remaining domestic business 
the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors on wesco s industrial segment is demonstrated by the significant decline in sales volume  in terms of pounds sold  from an average of million pounds annually over the three year period of through  to an average of million pounds annually over the most recent three year period 
average industrial segment revenues have not declined as significantly  principally because customers have generally accepted higher but competitive prices as wesco s industrial segment has struggled to maintain its margins 
demand slowed during as customers became increasingly resistant to higher prices  especially for stainless steel products  whose prices had increased in one year by approximately due to shortages and mill surcharges 
industrial segment revenues for decreased by million from those of excluding from revenues million attributed to an extraordinarily large sale of toolroom supplies to a single customer  revenues for decreased by million as compared with those of sales volume  in terms or pounds sold  decreased by approximately 
the year started out well 
industrial segment revenues for the first six months were up million  volume  in terms of pounds sold  was up by  as compared with figures for the first six months of in the third quarter of  revenues continued to increase  however  volume  in terms of pounds sold  gave up approximately half of the improvement that had been reported one quarter earlier  possibly because of softening economic conditions 
in the fourth quarter  revenues and pounds sold declined at an accelerating pace 
for the calendar year  sales revenues were down by million  and volume  in terms of pounds sold in the fourth quarter of  was down by from sales volume of the corresponding quarter  to million pounds for the fourth quarter 

table of contents segment income before income taxes and net income have remained relatively unchanged for each of the past three years  reflecting principally the industrial segment s ongoing efforts to maintain the steadiness of its cost of sales  determined on the lifo last in  first out basis  which  in terms of lifo cost percentages relative to revenues  were  and  for  and  and the detrimental effect of an increase in the provision by million in and the beneficial effect of a decrease in the provision by million in  for the ultimate cost of the ongoing environmental matter discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these adjustments increased decreased after tax segment income by million for and by million for unrelated to business segment operations realized gains and losses on wesco s investments have fluctuated in amount from year to year  sometimes impacting net income significantly 
amounts and timing of these realizations have no predictive or practical analytical value 
wesco s investments are carried at fair value  and unrealized gains and losses are reflected  net of deferred income tax effect  in the unrealized appreciation component of other comprehensive income  in its shareholders equity 
when gains or losses are realized  due to sale of securities or other triggering events  they are credited or charged to the consolidated statement of income  generally  in wesco s case  there has been little effect on total shareholders equity essentially only a transfer from net unrealized appreciation to retained earnings 
wesco s consolidated earnings contained net realized investment gains  after taxes  of million for and million for  no gains or losses were realized in management s principal goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments 
investments may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire to generate funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
investment gains may also derive from non cash exchanges of securities for other investment securities as a result of merger activity involving the investees 
other nonsegment items include mainly rental income from owned commercial real estate and dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries  reduced by real estate and general and administrative expenses 
consolidated revenues  expenses and net income reported for any period are not necessarily indicative of future results in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of participations in reinsurance contracts with members of the berkshire insurance group  such as the quota share arrangement with nico described in item  business  which is expected to significantly increase the business of the insurance segment for a five year period beginning in  investment gains and losses  or unusual nonoperating items 
in addition  consolidated revenues  expenses and net income are subject to external conditions  such as terrorist activity  and changes in the economy 
wesco is not presently suffering from inflation  but each of its business operations has potential exposure 
large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  making their earnings susceptible to inflationary and deflationary cost changes  the impact  though not material in relation to wesco s consolidated net income  may be significant to that of the industrial segment  due particularly to the segment s use of lifo inventory accounting 
as we head into a very difficult economic period  management will continue to exercise judgment in all aspects of wesco s operations  with the goal of maximizing shareholder value over the long term 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations neither wesco nor any of its subsidiaries has off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations discussed below 
nor do they have any insurance obligations for which estimated provisions have not been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
wesco and its subsidiaries have contractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities  which will result in cash payments in future periods 
certain obligations  such as notes payable  accrued interest  and unpaid insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  wesco and its subsidiaries have entered into long term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future  which are not currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements and will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided 
a summary of contractual obligations as of december  follows 
amounts are in thousands 
payments due total thereafter notes payable  including interest operating lease obligations payment of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses purchase obligations  other than for capital expenditures purchase obligations for capital expenditures other  principally deferred compensation totals amounts and timing of payments are significantly dependent on estimates 
see critical accounting policies and practices below 
principally  construction costs of ms property s luxury condominium development 
during  credit markets became increasingly restricted as a consequence of the ongoing worldwide credit crisis 
as a result  the availability of credit to corporations has declined significantly and interest rates for new issues increased relative to government obligations  even for companies with strong credit histories and capital to withstand these conditions 
management believes that wesco currently maintains ample liquidity to cover its contractual obligations and provide for contingent liquidity needs 
critical accounting policies and practices wesco s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the significant accounting policies and practices followed by wesco are set forth in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
following are the accounting policies and practices considered by wesco s management to be critical to the determination of consolidated financial position and results of operations 
use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the period reported upon 
in particular  estimates of written and earned premiums and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty insurance are subject to considerable estimation error due both to the necessity of estimating information with respect to certain reinsurance 
table of contents contracts where reports from ceding companies for quarterly reporting periods are not contractually due until after the balance sheet date  as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating ultimate claim amounts that will be reported and settled over a period of many years 
the estimates and assumptions are based on management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances using information available at the time such estimates and assumptions are made 
the amounts of such assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses included in the consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from those that might result from use of estimates and assumptions based on facts and circumstances not yet available 
although wesco s management does not believe such changes in estimates would have a materially adverse effect on shareholders equity  they could produce a material effect on results of operations in a reporting period 
investments the appropriate classifications of investments in securities with fixed maturities and marketable equity securities are established at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
there are three permissible classifications held to maturity  trading  and  when neither of those classifications is applicable  available for sale 
in recent years  all equity and fixed maturity investments have been classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of applicable deferred income taxes  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
wesco carries its investments on its consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
fair value is defined under statement of financial accounting standards  promulgated by the financial accounting standards board sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
the standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value based on observable  independent market inputs and unobservable market assumptions 
following is a description of the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs represent observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities 
level inputs are unobservable inputs  based on management s assumptions  that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
see notes and to wesco s consolidated financial statements for additional information as to wesco s investments 
rental furniture rental furniture consists principally of residential and office furniture which is available for rental or  if no longer up to rental standards or excessive in quantity  for sale 
rental furniture is carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation calculated primarily on a declining balance basis over to years using estimated salvage values of to percent of original cost 
revenue recognition insurance premiums are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers and are recognized as earned revenues in proportion to the insurance protection provided  which in most cases is pro rata over the term of each contract 
premiums are estimated with respect to certain reinsurance contracts written during the period where reports from ceding companies for the period are not contractually due until well after the balance sheet date 
unearned insurance premiums are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
certain costs of acquiring insurance premiums commissions  premium taxes  and other are deferred and charged to income as the premiums are earned 

table of contents furniture rentals are recognized as revenue proportionately over the rental contract period  rentals received in advance are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
related costs comprise the main element of cost of products and services sold on the consolidated income statement and include depreciation expense  repairs and maintenance and inventory losses 
revenues from product sales are recognized upon passage of title to the customer  which coincides with customer pickup  product shipment  delivery or acceptance  depending on the sales arrangement 
revenues from services performed are recognized at the completion of the elements specified in the contract  which typically coincides with their being billed 
interest income from investments in bonds and mortgage backed securities is earned under the constant yield method and includes accrual of interest due as well as amortization of acquisition premiums and accruable discounts 
in determining the constant yield for mortgage backed securities  anticipated counterparty prepayments are estimated and evaluated periodically 
dividends from equity securities are earned on the ex dividend date 
losses and loss adjustment expenses liabilities for unpaid insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under property and casualty reinsurance and insurance contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
liabilities for insurance losses are comprised of estimates for reported claims case reserves  and reserve development on reported claims as well as estimates for claims that have not yet been reported some of which may not be reported for many years  which together are also referred to as incurred but not reported reserves ibnr reserves 
the liability for unpaid losses includes significant estimates for these claims and includes estimates reported by ceding insurers 
loss reserve estimates reflect past loss experience  adjusted as appropriate when losses are reasonably expected to deviate from experience 
considerable judgment is required to evaluate claims and estimate claims liabilities in connection with reinsurance contracts 
as further data become available  the liabilities are reevaluated and adjusted as appropriate 
additionally  claims  at each balance sheet date  are in various stages of the settlement process 
each claim is settled individually based upon its merits  and some take years to settle  especially if legal action is involved 
actual ultimate claims amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
depending on the type of loss being estimated  the timing and amount of loss payments are subject to a great degree of variability and are contingent  among other factors  upon the timing of the claim reporting by cedants and insureds  and the determination and payment of the ultimate loss amounts through the loss adjustment process 
judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future with respect to loss events that have occurred 
provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported in the consolidated statement of income after deducting estimates of amounts that will be recoverable under reinsurance contracts 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding companies of their obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance contracts 
ceded reinsurance losses recoverable ceded reserves are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a component of accounts receivable 
the time period between the claim occurrence date and payment date of the loss is referred to as the claim tail 
property claims usually have fairly short claim tails  and  absent litigation  are reported and settled within a few months or years after occurrence 
casualty losses usually have very long claim tails 
casualty claims can be more susceptible to litigation and can be more significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment  which contributes to extended claim tails 
claim tails for reinsurers may be further extended due to delayed reporting by ceding insurers or reinsurers due to contractual provisions or reporting practices 
actual ultimate loss settlement amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
changes in estimates  referred to as loss development  
table of contents are recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of change

 swiss re contract other reinsurance  principally aviation related kbs primary total net of reinsurance recoverable  and before foreign currency translation effects 
included in other reinsurance losses in the foregoing table are million at yearend and million at yearend  representing non aviation reinsurance reserve amounts at those dates  consisting mainly of ibnr reserves relating to a quota share contract that has been in runoff for more than years  under which wes fic continues to make loss payments 
such amounts reflected loss estimates reported by the ceding companies and additional ibnr reserves estimates by wes fic management  which were mainly a function of reported losses from ceding companies  anticipated loss ratios for the contract period  and management s judgment as to the loss reserving adequacy of the ceding companies 
there is no reinsurance recoverable with respect to these reserves 
the techniques and processes employed in estimating loss reserves are differentiated between reinsurance and primary insurance 
reinsurance historically  wes fic s property and casualty loss reserves derive from individual risk  multi line and catastrophe reinsurance policies 
in  wes fic entered into a retrocession agreement with national indemnity company  nico  a wholly owned insurance subsidiary of its parent company  berkshire hathaway inc  to assume of nico s quota share reinsurance of swiss reinsurance company and its property casualty affiliates swiss re 
under this retrocession agreement  wes fic has assumed part of nico s quota share reinsurance of all swiss re property casualty risks incepting over a five year period beginning in  on the same terms as nico s agreement with swiss re 
other wes fic reinsurance activities in recent years have consisted almost exclusively of participations in aviation related pools that are underwritten and managed by a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of berkshire hathaway 

table of contents losses from aviation coverages generally have reasonably short tails with respect to the property components 
the claim tail for the liability coverage can be somewhat longer  especially when litigation results 
the case reserving process for aviation risks is believed to involve less uncertainty than for many other types of insurance  because loss events tend to become known and reported relatively soon after the events occur 
the material judgments underlying the loss reserving by the aviation pools manager assume that future loss patterns incurred and paid will be similar to those of the past 
the aviation pools manager establishes case and ibnr reserves and manages the claims settlement process  including payment of the related claims 
wes fic is allocated its share of these amounts  monthly 
the pools manager has considerable experience with aviation insurance and claims 
wes fic management reviews reported claim amounts for reasonableness and has historically accepted the amounts without further adjustment  except for adjustments made for minor reporting delays 
wes fic management is represented at regular meetings and presentations held by the aviation pools manager  and wesco believes that wes fic is able to closely monitor and assess the pools manager s judgments concerning reserves 
wes fic s estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses under the swiss re contract are derived from swiss re s quarterly reports to nico on a quarterly lag basis  plus nico s and wes fic s managements estimates of underwriting results for the current quarter  which reflect their assessments of publicly available information and prevailing market conditions 
as swiss re s business underlying the contract is predominately reinsurance  swiss re s quarterly reports are affected by the estimation processes of its management  which are believed to be similar to those underlying wes fic s other reinsurance contracts 
in addition  inasmuch as more than half of the business assumed under the swiss re contract is denominated with nico in currencies other than united states dollars  significant portions of assumed losses are also subject to foreign exchange risks relative to united states dollars 
thus  the foreign exchange risk adds greater uncertainty to the underwriting results estimated by management than the uncertainty relating to the other property casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts in which wes fic participates 
wesco and wes fic managements understand and accept the greater uncertainty under the swiss re contract as a business risk compensated by management s judgment of the expected profitability of the assumed business 
primary insurance loss reserves from wesco s primary insurance activities derive from individual risk policies written by kbs  which primarily provides specialty coverages for financial institutions 
reserve amounts are comprised of case estimates and estimates of ibnr reserves  which approximated million at both yearends of and because of the relatively low number or frequency of losses and potential for higher severity or amount per claim  kbs management is familiar with and closely monitors each claim 
losses generally are expected to have a relatively short reporting and claim tail due to the nature of the claims 
kbs provides crime insurance  check kiting fraud indemnification  internet banking catastrophe theft insurance  internet banking privacy liability insurance  directors and officers liability  bank employment practices  and bank insurance agents professional errors and omissions indemnity 
kbs has also offered deposit guarantee bonds which insure bank deposits in excess of federally insured limits bonds  and  until recently  accounted for approximately half of its million of annual premium volume 
because of recent events in the banking industry  including a number of bank failures  management is less confident in the long term profitability of this line of insurance than previously 
kbs s customer base consists principally of small midwestern banks  few of which are believed to be subject to significant risk of failure 
however  in the third quarter of one of its customer banks failed  resulting in a loss to kbs  and thus  to wesco  of million  after taxes 
in september  kbs notified customers of its decision to exit this line of insurance as rapidly as feasible 
as a result of kbs management s intimate knowledge as to its claims  reserves are developed primarily from case estimates  reducing the need for extended actuarial studies and broad estimates of ibnr of the nature typically performed by large primary insurers whose business volume requires such procedures for the development of their loss data 
a range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared 

table of contents goodwill of acquired businesses goodwill of acquired businesses represents the excess of the cost of acquired entities principally cort over the fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
annual impairment tests are performed in the fourth quarter of each year using a variety of methods that require that certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding economic factors and future profitability 
impairments  if any  are charged to earnings 
realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses  determined on a specific identification basis  are included in the consolidated statement of income  as are provisions for other than temporary declines in market or estimated fair value  when applicable 
factors considered in judging whether an impairment is other than temporary include the financial condition  business prospects and creditworthiness of the issuer  the length of time that fair value has been less than cost  the relative amount of the decline  and wesco s ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value recovers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet contains substantial liquidity as well as substantial amounts of investments whose estimated fair carrying values are subject to market risks 
its fixed maturity investments are backed by the us government and its agencies 
values of marketable equity securities are subject to fluctuations in their stock market prices  and values of securities with fixed maturities are subject to changes in interest rate levels 
apart from investments  the consolidated balance sheet at december  did not contain significant assets or liabilities with values subject to these or other potential market exposures such as changes in commodity prices or foreign exchange rates 
wesco does not utilize derivatives to manage market risks 
equity price risk strategically  wesco strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management  at sensible prices 
wesco s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee  resulting in concentration 
most equity investments are expected to be held for long periods of time  thus  wesco s management is not ordinarily troubled by short term price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
wesco strives to maintain above average levels of shareholders equity as well as much liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices 
during  several crises affecting the financial system and capital markets of the us resulted in very large price declines in the general stock market and in wesco s equity securities  particularly in the fourth quarter 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may also result from actual or perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee and the relative prices of alternative investments 
furthermore  amounts realized upon the sale of a particular security may be adversely affected if a relatively large quantity of the security is being sold 
wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained billion of marketable equity securities stated at market value  down from billion one year earlier 
the million decrease occurred in spite of wesco s investment of million net  in equity securities during the year 
the concentration existing in wesco s equity securities portfolio exposes it to more significant market price fluctuations than might be the case were wesco s investments more diversified 
this exposure to fluctuations is further exacerbated by the large amount invested in companies engaged in the banking industry  inasmuch as trading prices of financial institutions shares have been more severely impacted in recent months than 
table of contents have general trading prices  due significantly to the ongoing liquidity crisis as well as the deterioration of assets and earnings reported by the industry 
at december   five investments  whose carrying value aggregated billion  comprised of the carrying value of the company s equity securities portfolio 
these five were common stocks of wells fargo company  usbancorp  the procter gamble company  the coca cola company and kraft foods incorporated  of which the first two are in the banking industry and the latter three have significant global operations and thus are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table summarizes wesco s equity price risks as of december  and it shows the effects of a hypothetical overall increase or decrease in market prices of marketable equity securities owned by the wesco group on total recorded market value and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity at each of those dates 
amounts are in thousands 
december  december  increase decrease increase decrease market value of marketable equity securities as recorded hypothetical shareholders equity as recorded hypothetical the hypothetical changes in market values assumed in preparing the tables do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
actual results could be much worse or better due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentration existing in wesco s equity investment portfolio 
after yearend  through february   the market values of wesco s marketable equity securities declined  by million  after deferred taxes  resulting in an after tax decrease in wesco s shareholders equity by per share 
in addition  market price volatility  which increased significantly throughout  could continue into the future 
interest rate risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of cash and cash equivalents and million of securities with fixed maturities stated at fair value  versus million of cash and cash equivalents and million of securities with fixed maturities one year earlier 
consequently  market value risks with respect to interest rate movements or other factors as of december  are not considered significant 
the fair values of wesco s fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values 
fair values of wesco s investments may also be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
wesco  as a matter of practice  invests only in fixed maturity securities of the highest quality 
as of yearend  its fixed maturity investments consisted of securities of the us treasury and of agencies of the us government 
foreign currency risk in years prior to wesco s foreign currency risk was limited essentially to that of its investees  as it had and continues to have significant amounts invested in major international companies  such as the coca cola company  that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risks of their own 
wesco s participation in the swiss re contract beginning in has subjected wesco to an increasing amount of 
table of contents foreign currency risk inasmuch as more than half of the business assumed by nico under the contract is denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
in addition  cort s new us based subsidiary also subjects wesco to foreign currency risk  although the volume of business conducted in the uk has not become significant
