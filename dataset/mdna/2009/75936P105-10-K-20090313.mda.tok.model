wellsford s historic business the company was originally formed on january  prior to the adoption of the company s plan of liquidation  which we refer to as the plan see below  the company was operating as a real estate merchant banking firm which acquired  developed  financed and operated real properties and invested in private real estate companies 
the company s primary operating activities immediately prior to the merger were the development  construction and sale of its three residential projects and its approximate ownership interest in private reis 
the company is seeking to exit the residential development business in order to focus solely on the reis services business 
residential development activities at december   the company s residential development activities were comprised primarily of the following the unit gold peak condominium development in highlands ranch  colorado  which we refer to as gold peak

unsolicited offers and board rejections on august   reis s board rejected  for a second time  a proposal by costar to acquire the company for per share in cash 
in the view of the board  the price offered in the costar proposal was inadequate as it was below the long term value reis could realize for its stockholders by the pursuit of its business as an independent entity and the continued disposition of its real estate assets  or by an organized sale of the company 
costar made its initial unsolicited offer  also at per share in cash  on june   which was rejected by the board on june  on october   costar publicly announced on its quarterly conference call that it was formally withdrawing its offer 
merger with private reis on october   the company announced that it and reis services entered into a definitive merger agreement with private reis to acquire private reis and that the merger was approved by the independent members of the board 
the merger was approved by the stockholders of both the company and private reis on may  and was completed later that day 
the previously announced plan of the company was terminated as a result of the merger and the company returned to the going concern basis of accounting from the liquidation basis of accounting 
for accounting purposes  the merger was deemed to have occurred at the close of business on may  and the statements of operations include the operations of reis services  effective june  the merger agreement provided for half of the aggregate consideration to be paid in company stock and the remaining half to be paid in cash to private reis stockholders  except wellsford capital  the company s subsidiary which owned a converted preferred interest and which received only company stock 
the company issued  shares of common stock to private reis stockholders  other than wellsford capital  used  of the cash consideration which was funded by a  bank loan facility  which we refer to as the bank loan  the commitment for which was obtained by private reis in october and was drawn upon immediately prior to the merger  and paid approximately  which the company provided 
the per share value of the company s common stock  for purposes of the exchange of stock interests in the merger  had been previously established at per common share 
the value of the company s stock for purposes of recording the acquisition was based upon the average closing price of the company s stock for a short period near the date that the merger agreement was executed of per common share  as provided for under the existing accounting literature 
upon the completion of the merger and the settlement of certain outstanding loans  lloyd lynford and jonathan garfield  both executive officers and directors of private reis  became the chief executive officer and executive vice president  respectively  of the company and both became directors of the company 
the company s former chief executive officer and chairman  jeffrey lynford  remained chairman of the company 
lloyd lynford and jeffrey lynford are brothers 
the merger agreement provided that the outstanding loans to lloyd lynford and mr 
garfield aggregating approximately  be simultaneously satisfied with  of the company s shares received by them in the merger 
immediately following the consummation of the merger  the private reis stockholders owned approximately of the company 
as the company was the acquirer for accounting purposes  the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase by the company 
accordingly  the acquisition price of the remainder of private reis acquired in this transaction  combined with the historical cost basis of the company s historical investment in private reis  has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on respective fair values 
the company finalized the purchase price allocation in december  which was within the permitted time period for completing such an assessment under the existing accounting rules 
plan of liquidation and return to going concern accounting on may   the board approved the plan  and on november   the company s stockholders ratified the plan 
the plan contemplated the orderly sale of each of the company s remaining assets  which were either owned directly or through the company s joint ventures  the collection of all outstanding loans from third parties  the orderly disposition or completion of construction of development properties  the discharge of all outstanding liabilities to third parties and  after the establishment of appropriate reserves  the distribution of all remaining cash to stockholders 
the plan also permitted the board to acquire additional private reis shares and or discontinue the plan without further stockholder approval 
upon consummation of the merger  the plan was terminated 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  the company adopted the liquidation basis of accounting as of the close of business on november  under the liquidation basis of accounting  assets were stated at their estimated net realizable value and liabilities were stated at their estimated settlement amounts  which estimates were periodically reviewed and adjusted as appropriate 
the reported amounts for net assets in liquidation presented development projects at estimated net realizable values giving effect to the present value discounting of estimated net proceeds therefrom 
all other assets were presented at estimated net realizable value on an undiscounted basis 
the amount also included reserves for future estimated general and administrative expenses and other costs and for cash settlements on outstanding stock options during the liquidation 
the company returned to the going concern basis of accounting effective upon completion of the merger on may  selected significant accounting policies management has identified the following accounting policies which it believes are significant in understanding the company s activities  financial position and operating results 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
investments in entities where the company does not have a controlling interest were accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these investments were initially recorded at cost and were subsequently adjusted for the company s proportionate share of the investment s income loss and additional contributions or distributions preceding and then subsequent to the dates of reporting under the liquidation basis of accounting 
investments in entities where the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions among the company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
intangible assets  amortization and impairment web site development costs the company follows emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for web site development costs  which requires that costs of developing a web site should be accounted for in accordance with aicpa statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed for internal use sop 
the company expenses all internet web site costs incurred during the preliminary project stage 
all direct external and internal development and implementation costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over their remaining estimated useful lives  not exceeding three years 
the value ascribed to the web site development intangible asset acquired at the time of the merger is amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
amortization of all capitalized web site development costs is charged to product development expense 
database costs the company capitalizes costs for the development of its database in connection with the identification and addition of new real estate properties and sale transactions which provide a future economic benefit 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over a three or five year period 
costs of updating and maintaining information on existing properties in the database are expensed as incurred 
the value ascribed to the database intangible asset acquired at the time of the merger is amortized on a straight line basis over three or five years 
amortization of all capitalized database costs is charged to cost of sales 
customer relationships the value ascribed to customer relationships acquired at the time of the merger is amortized over years on an accelerated basis and is charged to sales and marketing expense 
lease value the value ascribed to the below market terms of the office lease existing at the time of the merger is amortized over the remaining term of the acquired office lease which was approximately nine years 
amortization is charged to general and administrative expenses 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or after a triggering event has occurred  requiring such a calculation in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned with the reporting unit s carrying value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions and includes consideration of the unsolicited offer for the company at per share 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  a second step is required to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
there was no goodwill impairment identified in or sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets  with determinable useful lives  be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up  and also that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets be reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is considered impaired 
the impairment expense is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period 
there was no intangible asset impairment identified in or goodwill and a major portion of the other intangible assets recorded at the time of the merger are not deductible for income tax purposes  as a result of the tax treatment of the merger 
real estate  other investments  depreciation and impairment costs directly related to the acquisition  development and improvement of real estate are capitalized  including interest and other costs incurred during the construction period 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
the company has historically reviewed its real estate assets  investments in joint ventures and other investments for impairment i whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable for assets held for use and ii when a determination is made to sell an asset or investment 
under sfas no 
and the going concern basis of accounting  if estimated cash flows on an undiscounted basis are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of an asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over estimated fair value is recognized 
the company recorded impairment charges aggregating approximately  and  in december and  respectively  which are reflected as a component of cost of sales on the statements of operations 
the december impairment charges were  in general  the result of continuing deteriorating market conditions in the fourth quarter of and management s expectations for the future 
the december impairment charges also reflect a change in intent and a lowering of management s expectations of sales prices with respect to the two properties as a result of the establishment of more aggressive and flexible pricing levels in an attempt to sell all of the remaining homes and lots during for the december calculation  the company utilized assumptions in its discounted cash flow model that reflected the negative impact of market conditions at that time and the negative effects on sales revenue  sales velocity  costs and the development plan 
further deterioration in market conditions  or other factors  may result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
under the liquidation basis of accounting  the company evaluated the fair value of real estate assets owned and under construction and made adjustments to the carrying amounts when appropriate 
the company recorded downward valuation adjustments aggregating approximately  related to two residential development projects during the liquidation period  including approximately  at december  and  at may  revenue recognition and related items the company s subscription revenue is derived principally from subscriptions to its web based services and is recognized as revenue ratably over the related contractual period  which is typically one year  but can be as long as months 
revenues from ad hoc and custom reports are recognized as completed and delivered to the customers  provided that no significant company obligations remain 
deferred revenue represents the portion of a subscription billed or collected in advance under the terms of the respective contract  which will be recognized in future periods 
if a customer does not meet the payment obligations of a contract  any related accounts receivable and deferred revenue are written off at that time and the net amount  after considering any recovery of accounts receivable  is charged to cost of sales 
cost of sales of subscription revenue principally consists of salaries and related expenses for the company s researchers who collect and analyze the commercial real estate data that is the basis for the company s information services 
additionally  cost of sales includes the amortization of database technology 
sales of real estate assets  including condominium units  single family homes and sales of lots individually or in bulk are recognized at closing subject to receipt of down payments and other requirements in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines 
the percentage of completion method is not used for recording sales on condominium units as down payments are nominal and collectability of the sales price from such a deposit is not reasonably assured until closing 
interest revenue is recorded on an accrual basis 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial reporting  including the liquidation basis of accounting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances with respect to deferred income tax assets are recorded when deemed appropriate and adjusted based upon periodic evaluations 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation  among other things  creates a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions 
recognition step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized upon settlement 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained or there is a satisfactory resolution of the tax position 
fin specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions  and it has expanded disclosure requirements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   in which the impact of adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
there was no financial statement impact upon the adoption of fin  effective january  liquidation basis of accounting with the approval of the plan by the stockholders  the company adopted the liquidation basis of accounting effective as of the close of business on november  the liquidation basis of accounting was used through may  when the merger was completed and at the same time the plan was terminated 
under the liquidation basis of accounting  assets were stated at their estimated net realizable value and liabilities were stated at their estimated settlement amounts  which estimates were periodically reviewed and adjusted as appropriate 
the statement of net assets in liquidation and a statement of changes in net assets in liquidation are the principal financial statements presented under the liquidation basis of accounting 
the valuation of assets at their net realizable value and liabilities at their anticipated settlement amounts represented estimates  based on present facts and circumstances  of the net realizable values of assets and the costs associated with carrying out the plan and dissolution 
the actual values and costs associated with carrying out the plan were expected to differ from the amounts shown herein because of the inherent uncertainty and would be greater than or less than the amounts recorded 
in particular  the estimates of the company s costs vary with the length of time it operated under the plan 
in addition  the estimate of net assets in liquidation per share  except for projects under development  did not incorporate a present value discount 
under the liquidation basis of accounting  sales revenue and cost of sales are not separately reported within the statements of changes in net assets as the company has already reported the net realizable value of each development project at the applicable balance sheet dates 
critical business metrics of the reis services business management considers certain metrics in evaluating the performance of the reis services business 
these metrics are revenue  revenue growth  ebitda which is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  ebitda growth and ebitda margin 
following is a presentation of these historical metrics for the reis services business for a reconciliation of gaap net income to ebitda for the reis services segment and to adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis for each of the periods presented here  see below 
the pro forma information for the years ended december  and is presented as if the merger had been consummated  the proceeds from the bank loan had been received  and the plan had been terminated as of january  this pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results would have been had the merger been consummated  the proceeds from the bank loan had been received and the plan terminated as of january   nor does it purport to represent future results 
amounts in thousands  excluding percentages for the three months ended december  percentage increase increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the three months ended december  september  increase decrease percentage increase decrease revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the period june  to december  a revenue ebitda ebitda margin a this information is presented consistent with the period under audit 
comparable information for this period is not disclosed 
we have included full year pro forma comparisons below 
for the years ended december  percentage increase pro forma increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin pro forma for the years ended december  percentage increase increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin reis services s ebitda in the fourth quarter of grew over the third quarter of and grew over the fourth quarter of ebitda for the year ended december  grew over the comparable pro forma period of for the three and twelve months ended december   the increase in ebitda over the comparable periods is primarily the result of i the revenue growth of and for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  over the comparable periods  ii a significant portion of the revenue growth translating directly to ebitda growth as a result of our fixed cost structure as demonstrated by the increase in ebitda margin from to from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of and an increase from to from the year ended december  pro forma to the annual period  iii as it relates to the annual comparison  higher expenses in the pro forma period as a result of accruals for other operational obligations of private reis that were not merger related costs or costs of the merged entities and iv management s implementation of cost control measures during revenue decreased slightly  by from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of  and was basically flat between the fourth quarter of and these results reflect a decline in the renewal rate in the fourth quarter of  and separately  the net effect of price increases and decreases 
during the third and fourth quarters of  contract price increases on renewals were constrained due to usage reductions at some large customers as well as budgetary pressures at our customers  predominantly in the banking industry 
we generally impose contractual restrictions limiting our immediate exposure to revenue reductions due to mergers and consolidations  however  this may be negatively impacted by bankruptcies of existing customers 
our pricing model is based on actual and projected usage  and is generally not as susceptible to downturns as would be a model based upon individual user licenses 
however  we may be impacted by future consolidation among our customers and potential customers  as a result of their reduced usage on a combined basis or greater bargaining power  or in the event that customers enter bankruptcy or otherwise go out of business  as has occurred during the latter part of on an annual basis  revenue increased  in the year ended december  over the pro forma year ended december   a increase 
historically  reis services has been able to grow revenue through new business as well as contract price increases in connection with renewals as evidenced by our year over year performance 
this amount was negatively impacted by the fourth quarter performance described in the preceding paragraph 
in addition  as noted in our september  form q and other quarterly filings  revenues in were positively impacted by additional special project and consulting work 
this amount was approximately  greater for the year ended december  than the amount recorded in the comparable annual period 
if we compared total revenue in the aggregate for these two periods without the additional revenue from special project and consulting work  the growth in our primary subscription business would have been  or 
our largest customer accounted for of reis services s revenue for the year ended december  our largest customers in the aggregate accounted for of reis services s revenue in that period  of which customers each accounted for greater than of our revenue 
despite the current dislocations in the financial markets  overall report usage grew from to further  our overall annual renewal rate for the year ended december  was  with a higher rate among our institutional customers at 
the sales force continues to have success in retaining customers by emphasizing the value of reis se  highlighting its ability to assist in risk analysis and management  as well as transaction support 
reconciliations of net loss income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  impairment losses on real estate assets and stock based compensation 
although ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  senior management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda to measure operational and management performance 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are appropriate metrics that may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported gaap basis financial information to assist investors in evaluating and understanding the company s business from year to year or period to period  as applicable 
further  these measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization expenses  as well as other non operating items  such as interest income  interest expense and income taxes  and in the case of adjusted ebitda  isolates non cash charges for impairment losses on real estate assets and stock based compensation 
management also believes that disclosing ebitda and adjusted ebitda will provide better comparability to other companies in reis services s type of business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure has been to changes in interest rates 
this risk is generally managed by limiting the company s financing exposures  to the extent possible  by purchasing interest rate caps when deemed appropriate 
at december   the company s only exposure to interest rates was variable rate based debt 
this exposure has historically been minimized in certain circumstances through the use of interest rate caps 
due to the fact that the east lyme construction loan matures in june and has mandatory principal repayments during that period  management determined that the exposure to increasing interest rates was not significant for this loan and therefore has let the applicable interest rate cap expire 
the interest rate cap on the bank loan expires in june the following tables present the effect of a increase in the applicable base rates of variable rate debt at december  and  respectively amounts in thousands balance at december  notional amount at december  libor cap libor at december  additional interest incurred variable rate debt with interest rate caps bank loan a without interest rate caps east lyme construction loan  n a a a reflects additional interest which could be incurred annually on the loan balance amount as a result of a increase in libor

b an increase in interest incurred would result primarily in additional interest being capitalized into the basis of this project 
c the east lyme interest rate cap of libor at expired in july reis holds cash and cash equivalents at various regional and national banking institutions 
management monitors the institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
management s emphasis is primarily on safety of principal 
management  in its discretion  has diversified reis s cash and cash equivalents among banking institutions to potentially minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
cash balances held at banking institutions with which we do business may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while management monitors the cash balances in these bank accounts  such cash balances could be impacted if the underlying banks fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets
