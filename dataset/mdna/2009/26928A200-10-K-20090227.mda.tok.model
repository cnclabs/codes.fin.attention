risk factors the following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
risks related to our business and industry current worldwide economic conditions may result in reduced procedures using our products  which would adversely affect our net sales 
general worldwide economic conditions have experienced a significant downturn due to the effects of the subprime lending crisis  general credit market crisis  collateral effects on the finance and banking industries  concerns about inflation  slower economic activity  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns 
our business is not immune 
we believe the current worldwide economic crisis has resulted and may continue to result in reduced procedures using our products 
many of the procedures that use our products are  to some extent  elective and therefore can be deferred by patients 
in light of the current economic conditions  patients may not be as willing to take time off from work or spend their money on deductibles and co payments often required in connection with the procedures that use our products 
in particular  patients that have high deductible health plans and health 
table of contents savings accounts and thus require the patients to incur significant out of pocket costs are especially more apt to defer procedures at times when cash is tight 
while we believe worldwide economic conditions may have contributed to a softening in our net sales growth rates during as compared to  the specific impact is difficult to measure 
furthermore  we are unable to predict how these economic conditions will impact our future sales 
current worldwide economic conditions may have other adverse implications on our business  operating results and financial condition 
beyond patient demand  the worldwide economic crisis  including in particular its effect on the credit and capital markets  may have other adverse implications on our business 
for example  our customers and distributors ability to borrow money from their existing lenders or to obtain credit from other sources to purchase our products may be impaired resulting in a decrease in sales 
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past  especially given the current turmoil in the worldwide economy 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers or distributors could cause unfavorable trends in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the worldwide economic crisis may adversely impact our suppliers ability to provide us with materials and components  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
disruptions in the global financial markets could impact the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us and our ability to obtain any additional future financing if needed or desired 
disruptions in the global financial markets  including the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and other governments and the related liquidity crisis  have considerably disrupted the credit and capital markets 
our credit risk consists of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade receivables  lending commitments and insurance relationships in the ordinary course of business 
we place cash  cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  which we monitor regularly and take action where possible to mitigate risk 
we do not hold investments in auction rate securities  mortgage backed securities  collateralized debt obligations  individual corporate bonds  special investment vehicles or any other investments which have been directly impacted by the worldwide financial crisis 
our insurance programs are with carriers that remain highly rated and we have no significant pending claims 
however  the disruptions in the credit and capital markets could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations or commitments to us under our contracts with them 
to date  our credit arrangement with silicon valley bank remains available to us 
although we do not anticipate requiring any additional financing in the near future  in the event we needed or desired such additional financing  we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets and or raising money in the capital markets 
we have a history of net losses and no assurance can be provided that we will achieve our goal of sustained profitability 
we are not profitable and had a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended december  although we expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future  no assurance can be provided that we will achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  or ever  or that we will achieve our goal of sustained profitability 
especially in light of the current economic recession  it is difficult to predict our future financial performance and our failure to accurately predict future financial performance may lead to volatility in the price of our common stock 
our ability to achieve cash flow positive operations will be influenced by many factors  including the extent and duration of our future operating losses  the level and timing of future sales and expenditures  our ability to increase net sales and decrease costs  market acceptance of our products  the results and scope of ongoing research and development projects  competing technologies  market and 
table of contents regulatory developments and the other risks described in this section 
if we do not achieve profitability within expected time frames  our business and stock price will be negatively impacted 
our business strategy relies on assumptions about the market for our products  which  if incorrect  would adversely affect our business and operating results 
we are focused on the market for endovascular devices used to treat vascular diseases and disorders 
we believe that the aging of the general population and inactive lifestyles will continue and that these trends will increase the need for our products 
however  the projected demand for our products could materially differ from actual demand if our assumptions regarding these trends and acceptance of our products by the medical community prove to be incorrect or do not materialize or if drug therapies gain more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative treatment  which in each case  would adversely affect our business and operating results 
our marketing activities are subject to regulation regarding the promotion of off label uses  which restrict our ability to market our products 
if we are found to have improperly promoted off label use of our products  we may become subject to enforcement action by the fda or the us department of justice and or incur significant liabilities 
any off label use of our products also may result in injuries that could lead to product liability claims against us 
we sell a number of our products to physicians who may elect to use the products in ways that are not within the scope of the approval or clearance given by the fda or for other than fda approved indications  often referred to as off label use 
for example  although our silverhawk plaque excision system received fda clearance for the treatment of atherosclerosis in the peripheral vasculature  off label use of our silverhawk outside the peripheral vasculature  in coronary and carotid arteries  has occurred  as well as off label use of the silverhawk for treatment of in stent restenosis 
in addition  although most of our stents received fda clearance for the palliative treatment of malignant neoplasms in the biliary tree  off label use of our stents occurs regularly in the peripheral arteries for the treatment of peripheral artery disease 
in fact  most of our us stent sales are attributable to off label use 
while off label uses of medical devices are common and the fda does not regulate physicians choice of treatments  the fda does restrict a manufacturer s communications regarding such off label use 
such laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of products for off label use restrict our ability to market our products 
although we have strict policies against the unlawful promotion of products for off label use and we train our employees on these policies  it is possible that one or more of our employees will not follow the policies  or that regulations would change in a way that may hinder our ability to sell such products or make it more costly to do so  which could expose us to enforcement action by the fda and the potential loss of approval to market and sell the affected products and or significant financial and other penalties and liabilities 
the fda and other regulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of off label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained 
during a march meeting  the fda warned device makers  including us  about promoting biliary stents for off label uses 
it is our understanding that during certain biliary stent manufacturers  including some at the march fda meeting  have since become involved in civil investigations by the us department of justice alleging that they have improperly promoted their biliary stents for off label uses 
although we have received no notice of any such investigation involving the sales practices of our biliary stents  no assurance can be provided that we will not become the subject of such an investigation  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and stock price 
it is also possible that our company or board of directors could become subject to civil litigation or breach of fiduciary duty claims alleging that we improperly promoted off label use of our products  which in turn improperly inflated our historical net sales 
off label use of our products may not be safe or effective and may result in unfavorable outcomes to patients  resulting in potential liability to us 
for example  the use or misuse of the silverhawk in the peripheral and coronary arteries has resulted in complications  including damage to the treated artery  internal bleeding  limb loss and death  potentially leading to a product liability claim 
in addition  the use or misuse of our biliary stents in the peripheral arteries to treat peripheral artery disease has resulted in complications  potentially leading to a product liability claim 
a study published in found that off label use of biliary 
table of contents stents was increasing and that the majority of adverse events and device malfunctions associated with the use of such stents occurs during off label usage 
if we want to market any of our products in the us for uses in ways for which they are not currently approved or cleared  we will need to obtain approval or clearance from the fda and in most cases conduct additional clinical trials to support such approvals and clearances 
such trials are often time consuming and costly 
for example  because our biliary stents received fda clearance for the palliative treatment of malignant neoplasms in the biliary tree  we are restricted in our ability to market or advertise such stents for the treatment of peripheral artery disease 
although we are currently in the process of enrolling patients for our durability ii ide trial to support an fda application to use our everflex stent in long lesions in the superficial femoral artery  no assurance can be provided that the results of this trial will adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our everflex stent for use in the peripheral arteries 
in addition  although we are in the process of enrolling patients for our definitive ca trial to support an fda application to use our silverhawk and spiderfx in the treatment of lower extremity sfa popliteal calcified lesions and intend to conduct other clinical trials to expand the indication of use of our silverhawk  no assurance can be provided that the results of these trials will adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the silverhawk for use in those expanded indications 
since a significant portion of our sales are derived from products that physicians in the past have elected to use and may continue to elect to use off label  ultimately  if physicians cease or lessen their use of our products for other than fda approved indications  sales of our products likely would decline  which could materially adversely affect our net sales and operating results 
in addition  if we are perceived not to be in compliance with all of the restrictions limiting the promotion of our products for off label use  we could be subject to various enforcement measures  including investigations  administrative proceedings and federal and state court litigation  which likely would be costly to defend and harmful to our business 
if the fda or another governmental authority ultimately concludes we are not in compliance with such restrictions  we could be subject to significant liability  including civil and administrative remedies  injunctions against sales for off label uses  significant monetary and punitive penalties and criminal sanctions  any or all of which would be harmful to our business 
finally  if one or more of our competitors obtains fda approval or clearance for a product to be used for a specific indication that was previously considered off label for such product  it is possible that physicians would be more likely to use the competitor s fda approved or cleared product rather than our products off label  which would adversely affect the sales of our affected products 
for example  c 
r 
bard inc recently announced that the fda cleared certain of its stents for use in the superficial femoral arteries and proximal popliteal arteries 
if physicians decide to use c 
r 
bard inc s fda cleared stents rather than our stents off label  sales of our stents could suffer 
if we fail to comply with laws prohibiting kickbacks and false or fraudulent claims and other similar laws  we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from governmental health care programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we are subject to various federal  state and foreign laws concerning health care fraud and abuse  including false claims laws  anti kickback laws  physician self referral laws and other similar laws 
many of these laws constrain the sales  marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements  including sales programs  with physicians  hospitals  laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices 
the scope of these laws and related regulations are very broad and many of their provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by existing case law or regulations  and thus are subject to evolving interpretations 
there is very little precedent related to these laws and regulations 
all of our financial relationships with health care providers and others who provide products or services to federal health care program beneficiaries are potentially governed by these laws 
while we have established policies and procedures based on the advamed code of ethics on interactions with health care professionals and implemented a broad based corporate compliance program in order to inform our employees regarding these laws and maintain compliance with them  no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to investigations or litigation alleging violations of these laws 
increased funding for enforcement of these laws and regulations has resulted in greater scrutiny of financial relationships 
table of contents with physicians and marketing practices and resulted in several governmental investigations by various governmental authorities  including investigations of the sales practices of several of our competitors 
any investigation or litigation against us  even if we were to successfully defend against it  would likely be time consuming and costly for us to defend 
it also would likely divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business  cause adverse publicity and damage our reputation 
if our arrangements were found to have violated any of these laws  we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and or civil penalties  including fines  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business and operating results 
similarly  if the physicians or other providers or entities with which we do business are found to be non compliant with such laws  they may be subject to sanctions  which also could have a negative impact on us 
if as a result of any investigation or evolving interpretation of these laws  our business practices or those of our competitors are found to be unlawful or otherwise challenged as or determined to be unlawful  we would be required or advised to change such practices  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
some of our products are emerging technologies or have only recently been introduced into the market 
if physicians do not recommend and endorse them or if our working relationships with physicians deteriorate  our products may not be accepted in the marketplace  which would adversely affect our business and operating results 
in order for us to sell our products  physicians must recommend and endorse them 
we may not obtain the necessary recommendations or endorsements from physicians 
acceptance of our products depends on educating the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics  perceived benefits  safety  clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of our products compared to products of our competitors  and on training physicians in the proper application of our products 
we often need to invest in significant training and education of our sales representatives or our physician customers to achieve market acceptance of our products with no assurance of success 
for example  the future success of our silverhawk products is dependent in part upon us educating first our sales representatives and second  physicians  and in particular interventional cardiologists  vascular surgeons  as well as general practitioners and other physicians  about screening for peripheral artery disease  or pad  referral opportunities and the benefits of our silverhawk products in relating to competitive products and other treatment options 
if we are not successful in obtaining the recommendations or endorsements of physicians for our products  if customers prefer our competitors products or if our products otherwise do not gain market acceptance  our business could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians  many of our products may not be developed and marketed consistent with the needs and expectations of professionals who use and support our products 
we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products and the marketing of our products 
if we are unable to maintain these strong relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input  the development and marketing of our products could suffer  which could adversely affect the acceptance of our products in the marketplace and our operating results 
at the same time  we recognize and are careful to ensure that our relationships with physicians comply with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations and our code of ethics on interactions with health care professionals  which is based on the advamed code of ethics on interactions with health care professionals 
demand for our atherectomy products in the united states has suffered due in part  we believe  to the lack of long term clinical data regarding their safety and efficacy 
future long term data regarding the safety and efficacy of our atherectomy products may not be positive or consistent with data currently available  which would adversely affect their market acceptance and our operating results 
one of the primary reasons we completed the acquisition of foxhollow was to add foxhollow s silverhawk and other products to our broad spectrum of technologically advanced products to treat vascular disease in the peripheral market to allow us to offer a more comprehensive and better integrated set of endovascular products to our customers 
at the time of the acquisition  we expected sales of the silverhawk to 
table of contents represent a significant portion of our future net sales 
however  we experienced decreased demand and sales of the silverhawk compared to levels experienced by foxhollow prior to our acquisition due in part to sales force integration challenges  elevated inventory levels of the product at some of our customers and increased competition 
we also believe the decreased demand and sales has been due in part to a lack of definitive long term clinical data regarding the safety and efficacy of the silverhawk 
in  we retained a third party research firm to help us examine our us atherectomy business 
the research firm conducted interviews with a significant number of physicians and sales force representatives and analyzed secondary data to understand factors driving the change in silverhawk usage and atherectomy procedures 
the results of this research confirmed our previously stated belief in the importance of investing in the necessary clinical trials to build the clinical foundation for the silverhawk and capitalizing on our next generation technologies to expand clinical usage  particularly in treating calcified lesions  total occlusions and longer lesions 
based on this third party research and our own due diligence  we believe that future demand for our atherectomy products will not increase if physicians are not presented with compelling data from long term studies of the safety and efficacy of our products compared against alternative procedures  such as angioplasty  stenting or bypass grafting and alternative technologies 
as a result  we have embarked upon our definitive trial series  which we expect to consist of three trials using our atherectomy products 
we are currently enrolling patients into our definitive ca trial to evaluate silverhawk and spiderfx in the treatment of lower extremity sfa popliteal calcified lesions and in the first half of  we expect to begin enrolling patients into our definitive le trial which will be a post market non randomized study of silverhawk in the treatment of femoropopliteal and tibial arteries 
these studies will be expensive and time consuming and there are no assurances that the results will prove favorable for our atherectomy products 
if the results do not meet physicians expectations  the silverhawk may not become widely adopted and physicians may recommend alternative treatments for their patients 
other significant factors that physicians will consider include acute safety data on complications that occur during the silverhawk procedure 
if the results obtained from any future clinical studies or clinical or commercial experience indicate that the silverhawk is not as safe or effective as other treatment options or as prior short term or long term data would suggest  market acceptance of the product may continue to suffer and the number of silverhawk procedures may continue to decrease  which would harm our business 
even if the data collected from clinical studies or clinical experience indicate positive results  each physician s actual experience with the silverhawk may vary and may not be as favorable  which would also adversely affect the demand for our silverhawk product 
other factors that may adversely affect the market acceptance of the silverhawk include the time required to perform the procedure and the lack of on board visualization capability 
if we do not incorporate certain design improvements to the silverhawk to respond to these and other physician preferences  we may be unable to generate new customers or retain our existing customers 
however  we have limited funds dedicated to research and development  and therefore  we will not be able to pursue all of these suggested design changes 
a decrease in silverhawk procedures and any failure by us to generate additional demand for the silverhawk will likely adversely affect our future net sales as well as our other operating results 
the demand for our products  the prices which customers and patients are willing to pay for our products and the number of procedures performed using our products depend upon the ability of our customers and patients to obtain sufficient third party reimbursement for their purchases of our products 
sales of our products depend in part on sufficient reimbursement by governmental and private health care payors to our physician customers or their patients for the purchase and use of our products 
in the united states  health care providers that purchase our products generally rely on third party payors  principally federal medicare  state medicaid and private health insurance plans  to pay for all or a portion of the cost of endovascular procedures 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and by region within some countries  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis and can take up to months or longer 
many international markets have government managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets  there are private 
table of contents insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
additionally  some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods 
any delays in obtaining  or an inability to obtain  reimbursement approvals or sufficient reimbursement for our products could significantly affect the acceptance of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business 
for example  international sales of our atherectomy products may be hampered by delay in obtaining reimbursement 
in addition  if the reimbursement policies of domestic or foreign governmental or private health care payors were to change  our customers would likely change their purchasing patterns and or the frequency of their purchases of the affected products 
additionally  payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can  without notice  deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products 
our business would be negatively impacted to the extent any such changes reduce reimbursement for our products 
healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade 
there have been and may continue to be proposals by legislators  regulators and third party payors to keep these costs down 
the continuing efforts of governments  insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs  combined with closer scrutiny of such costs  could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third party payors 
the cost containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting both in the united states and internationally could harm our business 
some health care providers in the united states have adopted or are considering a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
health care providers may attempt to control costs by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures or by requiring the use of the least expensive devices possible  which could adversely affect the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell our products 
we also sell a number of our products to physician customers who may elect to use these products in ways that are not within the scope of the approval or clearance given by the fda  often referred to as off label use 
in the event that governmental or private health care payors limit reimbursement for products used off label  sales of our products and our business would be materially adversely affected 
our stents and atherectomy products generate a significant portion of our product sales 
accordingly  if sales of these products were to decline  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our stents and atherectomy products generate a significant portion of our net sales 
during  our stents and atherectomy products generated approximately and of our product sales  respectively 
a decline in sales from these products as a result of increased competition  regulatory matters  intellectual property matters or any other reason would negatively impact our operating results 
our products face the risk of technological obsolescence  which  if realized  could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the medical device industry is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid and significant technological change 
the peripheral vascular and neurovascular markets in which we compete are in particular highly competitive and new technologies and products are often introduced 
therefore  product life cycles are relatively short 
developments by other companies of new or improved products  processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales 
for example  new procedures and medications that are more effective or less invasive or expensive could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current procedures that use our products or may cause our customers to cease  delay or defer purchasing our products  which would adversely affect our business and operating results 

table of contents our future success depends in part on the introduction of new products 
failure to introduce and market new products in a timely fashion that are accepted by the marketplace could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our success depends in part upon our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development and introduction of new products 
if we do not introduce new products and technologies  or if our new products and technologies are not accepted by the physicians who use them or the payors who reimburse the costs of the procedures performed with them  or if there are any delays in our introduction of new products  we may not be successful and our business and operating results would suffer 
accordingly  we must devote substantial efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products  obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products  obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products 
we plan to introduce additional products during which we expect to result in additional net sales 
we may experience delays in any phase of a product launch  including during research and development  clinical trials  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  marketing and the education process 
the relative speed with which we can develop or acquire products  complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance or approval processes  train physicians in the use of our products  gain reimbursement acceptance and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market are important competitive factors 
any delays could result in a loss of market acceptance and market share 
product development involves a high degree of risk  and we cannot provide assurance that our product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products 
many of our clinical trials have durations of several years and it is possible that such trials may not be successful or that competing therapies  such as drug therapies  may be introduced while our products are still undergoing clinical trials 
new products and technologies introduced by competitors may reach the market earlier  may be more effective or less invasive or expensive than our products or render our products obsolete  all of which would harm our business and operating results 
a number of our proposed products are in the early stages of development and some are in clinical trials 
if the development of these products is not successfully completed or if these trials are unsuccessful  or if the us food and drug administration  or fda  or other regulatory agencies require additional trials to be conducted  these products may not be commercialized and our business prospects may suffer 
several of our products are in the early stages of development 
some only recently emerged from clinical trials and others have not yet reached the clinical trial stage 
our ability to market our products in the united states and abroad depends upon our ability to demonstrate the safety  and in the case of the united states  efficacy  of our products with clinical data to support our requests for regulatory approval 
our products may not be found to be safe and  where required  effective in clinical trials and may not ultimately be approved for marketing by us or foreign regulatory authorities 
our failure to develop safe and effective products that are approved for sale on a timely basis would have a negative impact on our net sales 
our current and anticipated trials for include the create post approval study us  durability ii trial us  the definitive ca trial us  the definitive le trial u 
s  the swift trial us and the racer trial us there is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving the endpoints in these trials or  if we do  that the fda or other regulatory agencies will approve the devices for sale without the need for additional clinical trial data to demonstrate safety and efficacy 
some of the products for which we are currently conducting trials are already approved for sale outside of the united states 
as a result  while our trials are ongoing  unfavorable data may arise in connection with usage of our products outside the united states which could adversely impact the approval of such products in the united states 
conversely  unfavorable data from clinical trials in the united states may adversely impact sales of our products outside of the united states 
we continually evaluate the potential financial benefits and costs of clinical trials and the products being evaluated in them 
if we determine that the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approval of a product 
table of contents exceed the potential financial benefits of that product or if the projected development timeline is inconsistent with our investment horizon  we may choose to stop a clinical trial and or the development of a product  which could result in a decrease in our stock price if investors are disappointed in our decision 
our future success depends in part on our ability to sell our atherectomy and other products internationally 
there are risks inherent in operating internationally and selling and shipping our products and purchasing our components internationally  which may adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
one of our strategic objectives is to leverage our strong international presence to increase sales of our atherectomy and other products 
for the year ended december  and  and  respectively  of our net sales were derived from our international operations 
we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net sales from operations in international markets 
our international distribution system consisted of nine direct sales offices and stocking distribution partners as of december  in addition  we purchase some of our components and products from international suppliers 
the sale and shipping of our products and services across international borders  as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources  subject us to extensive us and foreign governmental trade regulations 
compliance with such regulations is costly and exposes us to penalties for non compliance 
other laws and regulations that can significantly impact us include various anti bribery laws  including the us foreign corrupt practices act  laws restricting business with suspected terrorists and anti boycott laws 
any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties  including imprisonment of individuals  fines and penalties  denial of export privileges  seizure of shipments  restrictions on certain business activities  and exclusion or debarment from government contracting 
also  the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities 
in addition  many of the countries in which we sell our products are  to some degree  subject to political  economic and or social instability 
our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions 
these risks include the imposition of additional us and foreign governmental controls or regulations  the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements  the imposition of us and or international sanctions against a country  company  person or entity with whom the company does business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country  company  person or entity  a shortage of high quality sales people and distributors  loss of any key personnel that possess proprietary knowledge  or who are otherwise important to our success in certain international markets  the imposition of different reimbursement requirements and changes in reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our products  changes in duties and tariffs  license obligations and other non tariff barriers to trade  the imposition of new trade restrictions  the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents  representatives and distributors  scrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines  penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us  pricing pressure that we may experience internationally  
table of contents laws and business practices favoring local companies  significantly longer payment cycles  difficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines  difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights  exposure to different legal and political standards due to our conducting business in over countries  and fluctuation in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies which may make the effective price of our products more expensive to our distributors in foreign markets 
no assurance can be given that one or more of the factors will not harm our business 
any material decrease in our international sales would adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
our international sales are predominately in europe 
in europe  health care regulation and reimbursement for medical devices vary significantly from country to country 
this changing environment could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in some european countries 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we transact business could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to fluctuate 
we sell our products to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
although most of our sales are made in us dollars  a significant portion of our sales are made in euros 
approximately and of our net sales were denominated in foreign currencies in and  respectively 
our principal exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non us dollar denominated sales in europe and throughout the world  as well as non us dollar denominated operating expenses incurred in europe and throughout the world 
our reported net earnings may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  with earnings generally decreasing with a strengthening us dollar and increasing with a weaker us dollar 
for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the exchange rate increase went into effect 
thus  a strengthening us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact business will adversely affect the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings 
although we may raise international pricing in such circumstances  such price increases may potentially reduce demand for our products  and thus in most circumstances  due to competition or other reasons  we may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the us dollar s strengthening or at all 
a weakening of the u 
s dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact business is generally beneficial to our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings 
however  it may cause us to reduce our international pricing  thereby limiting the benefit 
additionally  strengthening of foreign currencies also may increase our operating costs or costs of product components denominated in those currencies  thus adversely affecting our gross margins 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our price not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
we may hedge such exposure to foreign currency exchange rates in the future  especially if such rates continue to be volatile 
if we engage in hedging activities  such activities involve risk and may not limit our underlying exposure from currency fluctuations or minimize our net sales and earnings volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 

table of contents a substantial portion of our assets consist of goodwill and other intangible assets and any future additional impairment in the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses 
although we recorded million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges during our fourth fiscal quarter  as of december   goodwill still represented million and other net intangible assets represented an additional million  or  of our total assets 
if we are required to record any additional impairment charge to earnings relating to goodwill or our other intangible assets  it will have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses 
the accounting standards require goodwill to be reviewed at least annually for impairment  and do not permit amortization 
in the event that impairment is identified  a charge to earnings will be recorded and our stock price may decline as a result 
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
we are required to assess goodwill for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of our reporting units 
the first step determines whether or not impairment has occurred by estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the present value of future cash flows approach  subject to a comparison for reasonableness to our market capitalization at the date of valuation 
the second step measures the amount of any impairment 
we review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss on other intangible assets is recognized when future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying amount 
if we experience additional substantial declines in our market capitalization during or if we experience other events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of our goodwill and or other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we may incur additional non cash impairment charges to both our goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
for example  such other events or changes in circumstances may include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  or significant reductions in operating cashflows  or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if we are required to record an impairment charge to earnings relating to goodwill or our other intangible assets  it will have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses 
we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims  which could cause us to incur liabilities and costs  prevent us from selling our products  cause us to redesign our products  require us to enter into costly license agreements and result in other adverse consequences 
the medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights 
companies operating in our industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs  and many of our principal competitors have large patent portfolios 
companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage  including aggressively challenging the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the marketing of new products 
the fact that we have patents issued to us for our products does not mean that we will always be able to successfully defend our patents and proprietary rights against challenges or claims of infringement by our competitors 
whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues  the determination of which is often uncertain 
we have incurred in the past significant costs in connection with patent litigation  including most recently in connection with our previous litigation with the regents of the university of california and boston scientific corporation 
we continue to face the risk of claims that we have infringed on third parties intellectual property rights 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we receive notices from third parties alleging infringement or misappropriation of the patent  trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with the use of our products or we otherwise may become aware of possible infringement claims against us 
we routinely analyze such claims and determine how best to respond in light of the circumstances existing at the time  including the importance of the intellectual property right to 
table of contents us and the third party  the relative strength of our position of non infringement or non misappropriation and the product or products incorporating the intellectual property right at issue 
for example  we are aware of patents held by abbott laboratories that may be asserted against our foxhollow subsidiary in litigation that could be costly and limit our ability to sell the silverhawk or other products 
one of foxhollow s founders  john b 
simpson  phd  phd founded a company prior to founding foxhollow that developed an atherectomy device that is currently sold by abbott  and he is a listed inventor on several patents covering that device 
abbott s device is currently marketed and sold for use in coronary arteries 
although we are not currently aware of any claims abbott has made or intends to make against foxhollow  because of a doctrine known as assignor estoppel  if any of dr 
simpson s earlier patents are asserted against foxhollow by abbott  we may be prevented from asserting an invalidity defense regarding those patents  and our defense may be compromised 
abbott has significantly greater financial resources than us to pursue patent litigation and could assert these patent families against us at any time 
any adverse determinations in such litigation could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our silverhawk or other products  which would have a significant adverse impact on our business 
we also may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology 
prior to launching major new products in our key markets  we normally evaluate existing intellectual property rights 
however  our competitors may have filed for patent protection which is not as yet a matter of public knowledge or claim trademark rights that have not been revealed through our availability searches 
our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties intellectual property rights may not always be successful 
any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement  even those without merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend  result in us being required to pay significant damages to third parties  cause us to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  require us to redesign  reengineer or rebrand our products  if feasible  require us to enter into license agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party s intellectual property  which agreements may require us to pay significant license fees  including royalties  or may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all and which licenses may be non exclusive  which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies  divert the attention of our management and other personnel from other business issues  or result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation 
in addition  new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten a product s continued life in the market even after it has already been introduced 
any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products  we may lose market share to our competitors  which would harm our business 
our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright and trademark laws and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
in addition  we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent to us 
the united states patent and trademark office  or pto  may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications  and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications  if any  may not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous to us 
we could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the pto 
these proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our 
table of contents inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents 
our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products 
litigation also may be necessary to enforce patent rights we hold or to protect trade secrets or techniques we own 
intellectual property litigation is costly and may adversely affect our operating results 
although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology  there is no assurance that third parties will not be able to design around our patents 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
in addition  we rely on the use of registered trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products 
we also rely on common law trademark protection for some brand names  which are not protected to the same extent as our rights in the use of our registered trademarks 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to meaningfully protect all of our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology 
we seek to protect our know how and other unpatented proprietary technology  in part with confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees  independent distributors and consultants 
however  such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information 
for example  we are currently involved in litigation with cardiovascular systems  inc in which we allege misappropriation and use of our confidential information by csi and certain of csi s employees who were formerly employees of foxhollow 
the complaint also alleges that certain of csi s employees violated their employment agreements with foxhollow requiring them to refrain from soliciting foxhollow employees 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
for example  foreign countries generally do not allow patents to cover methods for performing surgical procedures 
if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries  our competitors may be able to compete more directly with us  which could adversely affect our competitive position and business 
we also hold licenses from third parties that are necessary to use certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products 
the loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing  marketing and selling these products  which could harm our business and operating results 
we manufacture our products at single locations 
any disruption in these manufacturing facilities  any patent infringement claims with respect to our manufacturing process or otherwise any inability to manufacture a sufficient number of our products to meet demand could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we rely on our manufacturing facilities in plymouth  minnesota and irvine  california 
any damage or destruction to our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
in the event that one of our facilities was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers if we could not shift production to our other manufacturing facility 
in the case of a device with a premarket approval application  we might in such event be required to obtain prior fda or notified body approval of an alternate manufacturing facility  which could delay or prevent our marketing of the affected product until such approval is obtained 
although we believe that we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties  such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
it is also possible that one of our competitors could claim that our manufacturing process violates an existing patent 
if we were unsuccessful in defending such a claim  we might be forced to stop production at one of our manufacturing facilities in the united states and to seek alternative facilities 
even if we were able to identify such alternative facilities  we might incur additional costs and experience a disruption in the supply of our products until those facilities are available 
any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient 
table of contents inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory  and therefore would adversely affect our net sales and operating results 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products in commercial quantities and therefore may encounter unforeseen situations that could result in delays or shortfalls 
manufacturers often experience difficulties in increasing production  including problems with production yields and quality control and assurance 
any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities  any inability to accurately predict the number of products to manufacture or to expand our manufacturing capabilities if necessary could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and these customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our dependence on key suppliers puts us at risk of interruptions in the availability of our products  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  increases in prices for raw materials and components used in our products could adversely affect our operating results 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and components used in our products 
for reasons of quality assurance  cost effectiveness or availability  we procure certain raw materials and components from sole and limited source suppliers 
we generally acquire such raw materials and components through purchase orders placed in the ordinary course of business  and as a result we do not have a significant inventory of these materials and components and do not have any guaranteed or contractual supply arrangements with many of these suppliers 
in addition  we also rely on independent contract manufacturers for some of our products 
independent manufacturers have possession of  and in some cases hold title to  molds for certain manufactured components of our products 
our dependence on third party suppliers involves several risks  including limited control over pricing  availability  quality and delivery schedules  as well as manufacturing yields and costs 
suppliers of raw materials and components may decide  or be required  for reasons beyond our control to cease supplying raw materials and components to us or to raise their prices 
shortages of raw materials  quality control problems  production capacity constraints or delays by our contract manufacturers could negatively affect our ability to meet our production obligations and result in increased prices for affected parts 
any such shortage  constraint or delay may result in delays in shipments of our products or components  which could adversely affect our net sales and operating results 
increases in prices for raw materials and components used in our products could also adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the fda and foreign regulators may require additional testing of any raw materials or components from new suppliers prior to our use of these materials or components 
in the case of a device with a premarket approval application  we may be required to obtain prior fda approval of a new supplier  which could delay or prevent our access or use of such raw materials or components or our marketing of affected products until such approval is granted 
in the case of a device with clearance under section k of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  referred to as a k  we may be required to submit a new k if a change in a raw material or component supplier results in a change in a material or component supplied that is not within the k cleared device specifications 
if we need to establish additional or replacement suppliers for some of these components  our access to the components might be delayed while we qualify such suppliers and obtain any necessary fda approvals 
our suppliers of finished goods also are subject to regulatory inspection and scrutiny 
any adverse regulatory finding or action against those suppliers could impact their ability to supply us raw materials and components for our products 
significant and unexpected claims under our everflex self expanding stent worldwide fracture free guarantee program in excess of our reserves could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
from october until recently  we provided a worldwide fracture free guarantee as part of our marketing and advertising strategy for our everflex self expanding stents 
in the event that an everflex self expanding stent should fracture within two years of implantation  we agreed to provide a free replacement product to the medical facility  subject to the terms and conditions of the program 
although we tested our everflex self expanding stents in rigorous simulated fatigue testing  we commercially launched our everflex 
table of contents self expanding stents on a worldwide basis in early march and  therefore  in only some cases  have two years of commercial data on which to base our expected claim rates under the program 
we may receive significant and unexpected claims under this guarantee program that could exceed the amount of our reserves for the program 
significant claims in excess of our program reserves could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our inability to successfully grow through future acquisitions  our failure to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing operations or our discovery of previously undisclosed liabilities could negatively affect our business and operating results 
in order to build our core technology platforms  we have acquired several businesses since our inception 
for example  most recently  in october  we completed our acquisition of foxhollow 
in september  foxhollow acquired kerberos proximal solutions  inc in january  we acquired the outstanding shares of micro therapeutics  inc that we did not already own 
we expect to continue to actively pursue additional targeted acquisitions of  investments in or alliances with  other companies and businesses in the future as a component of our business strategy 
our ability to grow through future acquisitions  investments and alliances will depend upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate attractive candidates on favorable terms and to obtain any necessary financing 
our inability to complete one or more acquisitions  investments or alliances could impair our ability to develop our product lines and to compete against many industry participants  many of whom have product lines broader than ours 
acquisitions  investments and alliances involve risks  including difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing projected efficiencies  cost savings  revenue synergies and other benefits of the acquired company or products  inaccurate assessment of the future market size or market acceptance of any acquired products or technologies or the hurdles in obtaining regulatory approvals of such products  inaccurate assessment of undisclosed  contingent or other liabilities or problems  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  adverse accounting consequences under recently revised accounting rules  or difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage the acquired business 
in addition  an anticipated or completed acquisition  investment or alliance could materially impair our operating results and liquidity by causing us to incur debt or reallocate amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or requiring us to expense incurred transaction and restructuring costs and amortize acquired assets  incur non recurring charges as a result of incorrect estimates made in the accounting for such transactions or record asset impairment charges 
for example  we incurred impairment charges to our goodwill and other intangible assets totaling million in our fourth fiscal quarter which charges related primarily to assets derived from previous acquisitions 
we also may discover deficiencies in internal controls  data adequacy and integrity  product quality  regulatory compliance and product liabilities which we did not uncover prior to our acquisition of such businesses  which could result in us becoming subject to penalties or other liabilities 
any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties or liabilities in connection with such businesses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
these risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time 
finally  any acquisitions that involve the issuance of our common stock could be dilutive to our stockholders 

table of contents consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or to the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our markets  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
because healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade  numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators  regulators and third party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create new companies with greater market power  including hospitals 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense 
this in turn has resulted and will likely continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations  independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers 
we expect that market demand  government regulation  third party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry  resulting in further business consolidations and alliances  which may increase competition  exert further downward pressure on the prices of their products and may adversely impact our business  financial condition or operating results 
our products and our product development and marketing activities are subject to extensive regulation as a result of which we may not be able to obtain required regulatory approvals for our products in a cost effective manner or at all  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the united states and abroad 
us and foreign regulations applicable to medical devices are wide ranging and govern  among other things  the development  testing  marketing and premarket review of new medical devices  in addition to regulating manufacturing practices  reporting  advertising  exporting  labeling and record keeping procedures 
we are required to obtain fda approval or clearance before we can market our products in the united states and certain foreign countries 
the regulatory process requires significant time  effort and expenditures to bring products to market  and it is possible that our products will not be approved for sale 
even if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted  it may not be granted within the timeframe that we expect  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  even if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted  the approval or clearance could limit the uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted  which may limit the market for our products 
even after a product is approved or cleared by the fda  we may have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations  non compliance of which could result in the subsequent withdrawal of such approvals or clearances  or such approvals or clearances could be withdrawn due to the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
we also are subject to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the fda if any of our products causes or contributes to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were it to occur might cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
any failure to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances on a timely basis or the subsequent withdrawal of such approvals or clearances could prevent us from successfully marketing our products  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in governmental agencies imposing fines and penalties on us  preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products  bringing civil or criminal charges against us  delaying the introduction of our new products into the market  suspending any ongoing clinical trials  issuing an injunction preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products or imposing restrictions  recalling or seizing our products  or withdrawing or denying approvals or clearances for our products 

table of contents our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may also result in us not being able to meet the demands of our customers and our customers canceling orders or purchasing products from our competitors  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
when required  with respect to the products we market in the united states  we have obtained premarket notification clearance under section k  but do not believe certain modifications we have made to our products require us to submit new k notifications 
however  if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit a new k notification for modifications to our existing products  we may be subject to enforcement actions by the fda and be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the k notification 
if the fda requires us to go through a lengthier  more rigorous examination than we had expected  our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled  which could cause our sales to decline 
in addition  the fda may determine that future products will require the more costly  lengthy and uncertain premarket approval application process 
products that are approved through a premarket approval application generally need fda approval before they can be modified 
if we fail to submit changes to products developed under ides or premarket approval applications in a timely or adequate manner  we may become subject to regulatory actions 
in addition  we market our products in select countries outside of the united states 
in order to market our products abroad  we are required to obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous requirements 
if additional regulatory requirements are implemented in the foreign countries in which we sell our products  the cost of developing or selling our products may increase 
we depend on our distributors outside the united states in seeking regulatory approval to market our devices in other countries and we therefore are dependent on persons outside of our direct control to secure such approvals 
for example  we are highly dependent on distributors in emerging markets such as china and brazil for regulatory submissions and approvals and do not have direct access to health care agencies in those markets to ensure timely regulatory approvals or prompt resolution of regulatory or compliance matters 
if our distributors fail to obtain the required approvals or do not do so in a timely manner  our sales from our international operations and our operating results may be adversely affected 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  we may be required to withdraw our products from the market  which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate sales 
as part of our post market regulatory responsibilities for our products classified as medical devices  we are required to report all serious injuries or deaths involving our products  and any malfunctions where a serious injury or death would be likely if the malfunction were to recur 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals  we may be required to redesign or reformulate our products  we may have to recall the affected products from the market and may not be able to reintroduce them onto the market  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and we may become the target of lawsuits  including class action suits 
any of these events could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing or marketing these products 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to extensive governmental regulation with which compliance is costly and which expose us to penalties for non compliance 
we and our third party manufacturers are required to register with the fda as device manufacturers and as a result  we and our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the fda for compliance with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  requirements  which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations  including testing  quality control and documentation 
table of contents procedures 
in addition  the federal medical device reporting regulations require us and our third party manufacturers to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or  if a malfunction were to occur  could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda 
we also are subject to similar state requirements and licenses 
in the european community  we are required to maintain certain international organization for standardization  or iso  certifications in order to sell products and we are required to undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications 
if we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to qsr or iso requirements  this could delay production of our products and lead to fines  difficulties and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances  the withdrawal of regulatory approvals and clearances  recalls or other consequences  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  regulatory agencies may not agree with the extent or speed of corrective actions relating to product or manufacturing problems 
our operations are subject to environmental  health and safety  and other laws and regulations  with which compliance is costly and which expose us to penalties for non compliance 
our business  properties and products are subject to foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  natural resources and worker health and safety and the use  management  storage  and disposal of hazardous substances  wastes  and other regulated materials 
because we operate real property  various environmental laws also may impose liability on us for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been released on our property  including releases unknown to us 
these environmental laws and regulations also could require us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third party locations where we disposed of or recycled hazardous substances 
the costs of complying with these various environmental requirements  as they now exist or may be altered in the future  could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms 
in addition  any equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders 
we believe that our proposed operating plan can be accomplished without additional financing based on current and projected net sales and expenses  working capital and current and anticipated financing arrangements 
however  there can be no assurance that our anticipated net sales or expense projections will be realized 
furthermore  there may be delays in obtaining necessary governmental approvals of our products or introducing our products to market or other events that may cause our actual cash requirements to exceed those for which we have budgeted 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount and timing of our continued losses and our ability to reach profitability  expenditures on intellectual property and technologies  the number of clinical trials which we will conduct  new product development and acquisitions 
to the extent that our then existing capital  including amounts available under our revolving line of credit  is insufficient to cover any losses and meet these requirements  we will need to raise additional funds through financings or borrowings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
equity financings could result in dilution to our stockholders  and the securities issued in future financings as well as in any future acquisitions may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock 
if our need for capital arises because of continued losses  the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital 
our quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future results 
our quarterly operating and financial results may fluctuate from period to period due to a combination of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these include the seasonality of our product sales  which typically results in higher demand in our fourth fiscal quarter and lower sales volumes in our third fiscal quarter  
table of contents the mix of our products sold  demand for  and pricing of  our products and the products of our competitors  timing of or failure to obtain regulatory approvals for products  costs  benefits and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  increased competition  the timing and extent of promotional pricing or volume discounts  the timing of larger orders by customers and the timing of shipment of such orders  field inventory levels  changes in average selling prices  the availability and cost of components and materials  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the possible deferral of revenue under our revenue recognition policies  the timing of operating expenses in anticipation of sales  unanticipated expenses  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  restructuring  impairment and other special charges  and fluctuations in investment returns on invested cash balances 
because of these and other factors  our quarterly sales and other operating results may vary significantly in the future and thus period to period comparisons may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
any shortfalls in sales or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts or investors could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
we may become obligated to make large milestone payments that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements in certain circumstances  which would negatively impact our cash flows from operations 
pursuant to the acquisition agreements relating to our purchase of mitralife and appriva medical  inc in  we agreed to make additional payments to the sellers of these businesses in the event that we achieve contractually defined milestones 
generally  in each case  these milestone payments become due upon the completion of specific regulatory steps in the product commercialization process 
with respect to the mitralife acquisition  the maximum potential milestone payments totaled million  and with respect to the appriva acquisition  the maximum potential milestone payments totaled million 
although we do not believe that it is likely that these milestone payment obligations became due  or will become due in the future  the former stockholders of appriva disagree with our position and have brought litigation against us making a claim for such payments and it is possible that the former stockholders of mitralife could also disagree with our position and make a claim for such payments 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement relating to foxhollow s purchase of kerberos proximal solutions  inc  foxhollow has agreed to pay certain earnout payments which are capped at million upon the achievement of contractually defined net sales milestones 
in august  foxhollow received a letter from counsel for the shareholder representatives of kerberos alleging that foxhollow has not used commercially reasonable efforts to market  promote  sell and distribute kerberos rinspirator products  as required under the agreement and plan of merger 
there can be no assurance that the stockholder representatives of kerberos will not commence litigation on the alleged claims 
the defense of the outstanding litigation related to our appriva acquisition and the outstanding claims related to foxhollow s kerberos acquisition is  and any such additional dispute with mitralife would likely 
table of contents be  costly and time consuming and divert our management s time and attention away from our business 
in the event any such milestone payments become due and or any other damages become payable  our costs would increase correspondingly which would negatively impact our cash flow from operations 
we rely on independent sales distributors and sales associates to market and sell our products outside of the united states  canada and europe 
our future success outside of the united states  canada and europe depends largely upon marketing arrangements with independent sales distributors and sales associates  in particular their sales and service expertise and relationships with the customers in the marketplace 
independent distributors and sales associates may terminate their relationship with us  or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
we are not able to control our independent distributors and they may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans 
in addition  many of our independent distributors outside of the united states  canada and europe initially obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approval for sale of our products in their respective countries 
our failure to maintain our relationships with our independent distributors and sales associates outside of the united states  canada and europe  or our failure to recruit and retain additional skilled independent sales distributors and sales associates in these locations  could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we have experienced turnover with some of our independent distributors in the past that has adversely affected our short term financial results while we transitioned to new independent distributors 
similar occurrences could happen to us in the future 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  including in particular any strengthening of the us dollar may cause our independent sales distributors to seek longer payment terms to offset the higher prices they are paying in local currency for our products 
in addition  in light of the worldwide economic crisis  the ability of our distributors to borrow money from their existing lenders or to obtain credit from other sources to purchase our products may be impaired or our distributors could experience a significant change in their liquidity or financial condition  all of which could impair their ability to distribute our products and eventually lead to distributor turnover 
we are exposed to product liability claims that could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the design  manufacture and sale of medical devices expose us to significant risk of product liability claims  some of which may have a negative impact on our business 
most of our products were developed relatively recently and defects or risks that we have not yet identified may give rise to product liability claims 
our product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we may incur or we may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance at acceptable rates 
if a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage and it is ultimately determined that we are liable  our business could suffer 
additionally  we could experience a material design defect or manufacturing failure in our products  a quality system failure  other safety issues or heightened regulatory scrutiny that would warrant a recall of some of our products 
a recall of our products could also result in increased product liability claims 
further  while we train our physician customers on the proper usage of our products  there can be no assurance that they will implement our instructions accurately 
if our products are used incorrectly by our customers  injury may result and this could give rise to product liability claims against us 
even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry  lead to significant legal fees and could result in the diversion of management s attention from managing our business and may have a negative impact on our business and our operating results 
in addition  successful product liability claims against one of our competitors could cause claims to be made against us 
we face competition from other companies  which could adversely impact our business and operating results 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants 
because of the size of the peripheral vascular and neurovascular markets  competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to aggressively promote their products and develop new and 
table of contents improved products 
our competitors and potential competitors may develop technologies and products that are safer  more effective  easier to use  less expensive or more readily accepted than ours 
their products could make our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
none of our customers have long term purchase agreements with us and may at any time switch to the use of our competitors products 
many of our physician customers like to experiment with new technologies 
within the atherectomy market  although we believe our atherectomy plaque excision products compete favorably against other competing technologies  surgical procedures and pharmaceutical products  recently introduced atherectomy products by our competitors have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect future sales of our atherectomy products  at least in the short term while physician customers experiment with such new products 
within the peripheral vascular stent market  we may experience increased competition from c 
r 
bard inc which recently announced that the fda cleared certain of its stents for use in the superficial femoral arteries and proximal popliteal arteries  if physicians decide to use c 
r 
bard inc s fda cleared stents rather than our stents off label 
our competitors range from small start up companies to much larger companies 
the larger companies with which we compete include abbott laboratories  boston scientific corporation  cook incorporated  cordis corporation a johnson johnson company and medtronic  inc all of these larger companies have substantially greater capital resources  larger customer bases  broader product lines  larger sales forces  greater marketing and management resources  larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than ours and have established reputations and relationships with our target customers  as well as worldwide distribution channels that are more effective than ours 
we also compete  however  and in some cases even more intensely  with smaller manufacturers 
in the peripheral vascular market  we compete against  among others cr bard  inc  medrad  inc  cardiovascular systems  inc  pathway medical technologies  inc  idev technologies  inc  invatec srl and spectranetics corporation 
in the neurovascular market  we compete against  among others balt extrusion  inc  terumo microvention  inc 
and micrus corporation 
in addition  we compete with a number of drug therapy treatments manufactured by major pharmaceutical companies  including otsuka pharmaceutical  the manufacturer of pletal  and sanofi aventis  the manufacturer of plavix 
we also compete with other manufacturers of medical devices for clinical sites to conduct human trials 
if we are not able to locate clinical sites on a timely or cost effective basis  this could impede our ability to conduct trials of our products and  therefore  our ability to obtain required regulatory clearance or approval 
we rely on our management information systems for accounting and finance  inventory management  distribution and other functions and to maintain our research and development and clinical data 
if our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions or if we experience an interruption in their operation  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems  on which we rely to effectively manage accounting and financial functions  manage order entry  order fulfillment and inventory replenishment processes  and to maintain research and development and clinical data 
the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and product development and could result in decreased sales  increased overhead costs  excess inventory and product shortages  causing our business and operating results to suffer 
in addition  our management information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers  and power loss or computer systems  internet  telecommunications or data network failure 
any such interruption could adversely affect our business and operating results 

table of contents we face a risk of non compliance with certain financial covenants in our loan agreement with silicon valley bank 
if we are unable to meet the financial or other covenants under the agreement or negotiate future waivers or amendments of the covenants  we could be in default under the agreement  which would give silicon valley bank a range of remedies  including declaring all outstanding debt to be due and payable  foreclosing on the assets securing the loan agreement and or ceasing to provide additional revolving loans or letters of credit  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our operating subsidiaries  ev endovascular  inc  ev international  inc  micro therapeutics  inc 
and foxhollow technologies  inc  are parties to a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
the facility consists of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding borrowings under the term loan and no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit  however  we had approximately million of outstanding letters of credit issued by silicon valley bank 
the loan agreement requires us to maintain a monthly specified liquidity ratio and a quarterly adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  level 
the loan agreement contains customary events of default  including  among others  the failure to comply with certain covenants or other agreements 
upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default  amounts due under the loan agreement may be accelerated by silicon valley bank 
if we are unable to meet the financial or other covenants under the loan agreement or negotiate future waivers or amendments of such covenants  an event of default could occur under the loan agreement 
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the loan agreement  silicon valley bank has available a range of remedies customary in these circumstances  including declaring all outstanding debt  together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon  to be due and payable  foreclosing on the assets securing the loan agreement and or ceasing to provide additional revolving loans or letters of credit  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
the restrictive covenants in our loan agreement could limit our ability to conduct our business and respond to changing economic and business conditions and may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that are subject to fewer restrictions 
our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank requires us to maintain a specified liquidity ratio and an adjusted ebitda level 
our failure to comply with these financial covenants could adversely affect our financial condition 
the loan agreement limits our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to  among other things transfer all or any part of our business or properties  permit or suffer a change in control  merge or consolidate  or acquire any entity  engage in any material new line of business  incur additional indebtedness or liens with respect to any of their properties  pay dividends or make any other distribution on or purchase of  any of their capital stock  make investments in other companies  or engage in related party transactions  subject in each case to certain exceptions and limitations 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
in light of the amount of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the amounts outstanding under the loan agreement  it is possible that if we needed to we could pay off the outstanding amounts under the loan agreement at this time 
however  it is also possible that if we do not generate cash from operations as we anticipate or if we incur significant unanticipated costs that we may need the flexibility provided under our silicon valley bank loan agreement 
the restrictive covenants under the loan agreement could limit our ability  and that of certain of our subsidiaries  to obtain future financing  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct 
table of contents necessary corporate activities 
the financial and restrictive covenants contained in the loan agreement also could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer restrictions 
transactions that we may view as important opportunities  such as acquisitions  may be subject to the consent of silicon valley bank  which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction 
we have experienced recently certain changes in our management which could cause certain ev key employees to depart because of difficulties with change or a desire not to remain with our company 
we have experienced several management changes during the past year 
in january  we appointed a new senior vice president and chief financial officer 
in december  the president of our us commercial organization resigned and the president of our peripheral vascular and foxhollow technologies divisions assumed leadership of our us peripheral vascular business 
in july  the president of our international business assumed leadership of our worldwide neurovascular business in addition to his current responsibilities 
in april  we appointed a new president and chief executive officer and non executive chairman of the board 
also in  four of our directors resigned or chose not to stand for re election  one former director rejoined our board and two new directors joined our board 
our future success depends  in large part  upon our ability to retain and motivate our management team and key employees 
key employees may depart because of difficulties with change or a desire not to remain with our company 
any unanticipated loss or interruption of services of our management team and our key employees could significantly reduce our ability to meet our strategic objectives because it may not be possible for us to find appropriate replacement personnel should the need arise 
if we become profitable  we cannot assure you that our net operating losses will be available to reduce our tax liability 
our ability to use  or the amount of  our net operating losses may be limited or reduced 
generally under section of the internal revenue code of  in the event of an ownership change of a company  the company is only allowed to use a limited amount of its net operating losses arising prior to the ownership change for each taxable year thereafter 
as a result of prior transactions effected by us and as a result of our acquisition of foxhollow  our ability to use our and foxhollow s existing net operating losses to offset us federal taxable income if we become profitable may be subject to substantial limitations 
these limitations could potentially result in increased future tax liability for us 
risks related to our common stock one of our principal stockholders and its affiliates are able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and could discourage the purchase of our outstanding shares at a premium 
as of february   warburg pincus beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  under a holders agreement  we are required to nominate and use our best efforts to have elected to our board of directors two persons designated by warburg  pincus and certain of its affiliates  which we refer to collectively as the warburg pincus entities  and vertical fund i  lp and vertical fund ii  lp  which we refer to together as the vertical funds  if the warburg pincus entities  the vertical funds and their affiliates collectively beneficially own or more of our common stock 
as a result of warburg pincus share ownership and representation on our board of directors  warburg pincus is able to influence our affairs and actions  including matters requiring stockholder approval  such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
the interests of warburg pincus may differ from the interests of our other stockholders 
for example  warburg pincus could oppose a third party offer to acquire us that the other stockholders might consider attractive  and the third party may not be able or willing to proceed unless warburg pincus  as one of our significant stockholders  supports the offer 
warburg pincus concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change in control of our company  could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale or merger of our company and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
transactions that 
table of contents could be affected by this concentration of ownership include proxy contests  tender offers  mergers or other purchases of common stock that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for shares of our common stock 
in such case and in similar situations  our other stockholders may disagree with warburg pincus as to whether the action opposed or supported by warburg pincus is in the best interest of our stockholders 
certain of our principal stockholders may have conflicts of interests with our other stockholders or our company in the future 
certain of our principal stockholders  including warburg pincus  may make investments in companies and from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us 
these other investments may create competing financial demands on our principal stockholders  create potential conflicts of interest  and require efforts consistent with applicable law to keep the other businesses separate from our operations 
these principal stockholders also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and  as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
furthermore  these principal stockholders may have an interest in us pursuing acquisitions  divestitures  financings or other transactions that  in their judgment  could enhance their equity investment  even though such transactions might involve risks to our stockholders 
in addition  these principal stockholders rights to vote or dispose of equity interests in us are not subject to restrictions in favor of us other than as may be required by applicable law 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable 
for example  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to million shares of blank check preferred stock 
without stockholder approval  the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights  including voting and dividend rights  to this preferred stock 
with these rights  preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors  whereby directors serve for three year terms  with approximately one third of the directors coming up for reelection each year 
having a staggered board makes it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest  which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of our company that is not favored by our board of directors 
we also are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
under these provisions  if anyone becomes an interested stockholder  we may not enter into a business combination with that person for three years without special approval  which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control 
for purposes of section  interested stockholder means  generally  someone owning or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of our company that owned or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years  subject to certain exceptions as described in section under one such exception  warburg pincus does not constitute an interested stockholder 
a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is held by insiders  and  as a result  the trading market for our common stock will not be as liquid as the stock of other public companies  and our common stock price could be volatile 
as of february   we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding and approximately of the shares were beneficially owned by directors  executive officers and their respective affiliates 
companies with a substantial amount of stock held by insiders can be subject to a more volatile 
table of contents stock price 
fluctuations in the price of our common stock could be significant and will likely be impacted by a number of factors  such as the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  changes in our growth rate or our competitors growth rates  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory clearance or approval for  and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis  loss of any of key management personnel  disputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights  product liability claims or other litigation  public concern as to the safety or efficacy of our products  the public s reaction to our press releases and other public announcements and our filings with the sec  sales of common stock by us  our significant stockholders  executive officers or directors  changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our common stock  other comparable companies or our industry generally  changes in expectations or future performance  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business  and changes in health care policy in the united states and internationally  including changes in the availability of third party reimbursement 
a significant decline in the price of our common stock could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation 
we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and we currently intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business  and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future 
as a result  our stockholders will only receive a return on their investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases

business overview we are a leading global endovascular company focused on identifying and treating peripheral vascular disease  including in particular lower extremity arterial disease  and neurovascular disease 
since our founding in  we have been dedicated to developing innovative  breakthrough and clinically proven technologies and solutions for the treatment of peripheral vascular and neurovascular diseases  a strategy that we believe is uncommon in the medical device industry 
we believe our unique approach of focusing on emerging and under innovated opportunities which treat peripheral vascular and neurovascular disease allows us to compete with smaller companies that have narrow product lines and lack an international sales force and infrastructure  yet also compete with larger companies that do not have our focus and agility 
we believe the overall market for endovascular devices will  in the long term  grow as the demand for minimally invasive treatment of vascular diseases and disorders continues to increase 
we intend to capitalize on this market opportunity by the continued introduction of new products 
we expect to originate these new products primarily through our internal research and development and clinical efforts  but we may supplement them with targeted acquisitions or other external collaborations 
in october  we acquired foxhollow technologies  inc foxhollow s principal product is the silverhawk plaque excision system  which is a minimally invasive catheter system that treats peripheral artery disease by removing plaque in order to reopen narrowed or blocked arteries 
additionally  our growth has been  and will continue to be  impacted by our expansion and penetration into new geographic markets  the expansion and penetration of our direct sales 
table of contents organization in existing geographic markets  and our continuing focus to increase the efficiency of our existing direct sales organization 
our product portfolio includes a broad spectrum of over products consisting of over  skus  including stents  atherectomy plaque excision products  embolic protection and thrombectomy products  and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty  or pta balloons  and other procedural support products for the peripheral vascular market and embolic coils  liquid embolics  micro catheters  flow directed catheters  occlusion balloon systems and neuro stents for the neurovascular market 
as a result of our foxhollow acquisition  we were engaged in a research collaboration with merck co  inc for the analysis of atherosclerotic plaque removed from patient arteries with the goal of identifying new biomarkers for atherosclerotic disease progression and new therapies for atherosclerotic disease 
our collaboration and license agreement with merck was terminated by merck effective july  we subsequently reached an arrangement with merck to accomplish an orderly wind down of our research collaboration activities during the remainder of our management  including our chief executive officer who is our chief operating decision maker  report and manage our operations in two reportable business segments based on similarities in the products sold  customer base and distribution system 
our peripheral vascular segment contains products that are used primarily in peripheral vascular procedures by interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists 
our neurovascular segment contains products that are used primarily by neuroradiologists  interventional neurologists and neurosurgeons 
our sales activities and operations are aligned closely with our business segments 
we generally have dedicated peripheral vascular sales teams in the united states  canada  europe and other international countries that target customers who perform primarily peripheral vascular procedures and separate  dedicated neurovascular sales teams in such countries that are specifically focused on our neurovascular business customer base 
we have corporate infrastructure and direct sales capabilities in the united states  canada  europe and other countries and have established distribution relationships in selected international markets 
our corporate headquarters is located in plymouth  minnesota and the sales  manufacturing  and research and development activities of our peripheral vascular business are primarily located in plymouth  minnesota  and to a lesser extent  in irvine  california 
the sales  manufacturing and research and development activities of our neurovascular business are primarily located in irvine  california 
in  in order to streamline our operations and improve efficiencies  we relocated the sales  manufacturing and research and development activities performed in our redwood city  california facility to our existing facilities located in plymouth  minnesota and irvine  california 
outside of the united states  our primary office is in paris  france 
we sell our products through a direct sales force and independent distributors in more than countries 
our sales and marketing infrastructure included professionals as of december  which consisted of sales professionals in the united states  canada and europe 
our direct sales representatives accounted for approximately of our net product sales during and with the balance generated by independent distributors 
since our acquisition of foxhollow  we have spent considerable time and resources integrating our two operations  including in particular  our us peripheral vascular sales force  and training our combined sales force on our combined product offering and cross selling opportunities 
we reduced the number of our us peripheral vascular sales representatives from at the time of our acquisition of foxhollow in october to as of december  in  we experienced difficulties integrating the two sales forces  resulting in increased turnover and a loss of focus on our silverhawk atherectomy products 
these internal difficulties were exacerbated by external forces in  including increased competition and relatively flat demand for atherectomy products in general 
we expect to continue to face similar external challenges during however  we remain optimistic about the longer term outlook for our atherectomy products 
one of our focuses for and beyond is to increase our atherectomy sales by improving our sales execution and productivity  adding new plaque excision products and developing definitive clinical data to support procedural expansion 

table of contents in december  we consolidated and aligned our us commercial and strategic peripheral vascular operations under one single president  stacy enxing seng 
we also recently have taken other actions designed to improve our us peripheral vascular sales execution 
for example  we hired a former foxhollow executive as our new vice president of us peripheral vascular sales 
we entered into non compete agreements with all of our us peripheral vascular sales team 
we revised our us peripheral vascular sales compensation plan to align our sales efforts with our focus on leading with atherectomy 
we also are in the process of improving our sales training program and modifying the structure of our us peripheral vascular sales organization to enhance the level of field based coverage that is required for silverhawk cases 
throughout our first fiscal quarter  we will be adding newly created silverhawk specialist positions replacing territory manager positions and all of our referral manager positions to partner with our regions to drive focused selling and clinical case support for our atherectomy business 
in  we also plan to continue to leverage our corporate account agreements  including our agreement with novation and our recently awarded a one year agreement with premier purchasing partners which covers our entire peripheral balloon and self expanding stent line 
with respect to our neurovascular business  in july  we consolidated and aligned our worldwide neurovascular operations under one single president  pascal er girin  who also maintains his current responsibilities as president of our international business 
in  our neurovascular business focused on continuing to advance the global launch of our axium coil 
in the us  the number of accounts generating axium sales doubled in compared to we also experienced strong sales of axium coils internationally  both in our european direct markets and in our distributor markets which benefited from market penetration in existing markets as well as launches in new geographic markets 
we believe the axium coil will continue to be a primary growth engine for our neurovascular business segment in in order to drive sales growth  we have invested heavily throughout our history in not only the expansion of our global distribution system  but also new product development and clinical trials to obtain regulatory approvals 
a significant portion of our net sales historically has been  and we expect to continue to be  attributable to new and enhanced products 
during  we launched the silverhawk lx m device in the united states and received fda clearance for our rockhawk atherectomy system for surgical use and the mm diameter prot g everflex self expanding stent system for use in the biliary 
during  we launched our prot g rx carotid stents  additional lengths in our everflex family of stents and our silverhawk ls m and ms m products in the united states for the peripheral vascular market and our axium coil and our onyx hd liquid embolic system  on a limited basis under an humanitarian device exemption  or hde  approval  for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms for the neurovascular market  all of which contributed to our net sales during and our us distribution agreement with invatec  under which we distributed the sailor plus  submarine plus  admiral xtreme and amphirion deep pta catheters and the diver ce thrombus aspiration catheter  expired on december  under the agreement  however  we are permitted to continue to sell our remaining inventory of invatec products through the end of june in anticipation of the termination of our invatec distribution agreement  we received fda clearance in december of two pta balloon catheters the evercross and nanocross 
we launched these products on a worldwide basis in january building on the success we have experienced to date with our axium coils  we are preparing for the launch of two new versions of the axium coil in the first half of  the axium pgla and axium nylon microfilament coils 
we also are planning to launch our new apollo delivery catheter for our onyx liquid embolic  which we expect to be available in the second half of we are also planning to launch several new access products for the neurovascular market throughout  including product upgrades and line extensions for our neuro balloons and guidewires 
we expect to continue our focus to further validate the clinical and competitive benefits of our technology platforms to drive utilization of our current products and the development of new and enhanced products 
to accomplish this  we have a number of clinical trials underway and others that are currently in development  including our durability i trial in europe measuring the durability of our prot g everflex stent in sfa lesions  our durability ii trial in the united states with the objective of expanding our everflex stent s us indication to include treatment of peripheral artery disease and our definitive trial series designed to expand the clinical evidence supporting the value of our silverhawk and rockhawk plaque excision systems 
table of contents to drive increased procedure adoption  expand clinical indications and support the use of atherectomy as a front line therapy 
in our neurovascular business  we are planning our solitaire with immediate flow restoration  or swift  study under a us investigational device exemption  or ide  to obtain fda clearance for our solitaire neuro stent 
it is our understanding that during certain biliary stent manufacturers received subpoenas from the us department of justice 
based on publicly available information  we believe that these subpoenas requested information regarding the sales and marketing activities of these manufacturers biliary stent products and that the department of justice is seeking to determine whether any of these activities violated civil and or criminal laws  including the federal false claims act  the food and drug cosmetic act and the anti kickback statute in connection with medicare and or medicaid reimbursement paid to third parties 
as of the date of this report  we have not received a subpoena from the us department of justice relating to this investigation 
no assurance can be provided  however  that we will not receive such a subpoena or become the subject of such an investigation  which could adversely affect our business and stock price 
summary of financial results and outlook for fiscal year was a year of transition in several respects 
we took several actions to appropriately size our organization  put in place the right management team and prioritize the vital few programs that we believe will drive our business and help us work toward fulfilling our vision to be recognized globally as the market leader in identifying and treating lower extremity arterial and neurovascular disease through innovative  breakthrough and clinically proven endovascular technologies 
although some of these actions may have adversely affected our operating results  we believe these actions will help us work towards our goals of achieving sustained profitability  generating cash and expanding our global position in the peripheral vascular and neurovascular markets to deliver superior long term value to our stockholders 
our results and financial condition included the following items of significance  some of which we expect also may affect our results and financial condition in our net sales increased in compared to we attribute this increase primarily to the addition of atherectomy product sales as a result of our acquisition of foxhollow  expansion in our neurovascular and international businesses and increased sales of our other peripheral vascular products 
our net sales of million for included product net sales of million in our peripheral vascular segment  million in our neurovascular segment and million of research collaboration revenue 
as a result of the termination of our collaboration and license agreement with merck  we do not expect any future research collaboration revenue 
net sales of our peripheral vascular products increased to million in compared to this sales growth was primarily the result of our foxhollow acquisition and increased market penetration of our everflex family of stents 
our net sales included million of atherectomy product sales  which we believe were significantly hampered by a relatively flat demand for atherectomy products in general and a decreased demand for our silverhawk atherectomy products in particular 
we believe we lost market share during as a result of increased competition and related physician trialing of competitive devices  increased turnover in our us peripheral vascular sales organization and a loss of focus of our sales organization on our silverhawk atherectomy products 
although we expect to continue to face intense competition during  we remain optimistic about the longer term outlook for our atherectomy products 
one of our focuses for and beyond is to increase our atherectomy sales by improving our sales execution and productivity  adding new plaque excision products and developing definitive clinical data to support procedural expansion 
with respect to our stents  we expect continued penetration with our everflex family of stents in  although we are cautious of the current regulatory environment regarding the promotion of off label devices and increased competition we believe we may experience 
net sales of our neurovascular products increased to million in compared to million in as a result of increased penetration of new and existing products and sales growth in virtually all of our neurovascular access and delivery products 
net sales of our embolic 
table of contents products increased to million in compared to primarily due to the launch of the axium coil and increased market penetration of the onyx liquid embolic system 
we believe the axium coil will continue to be a primary source of growth for our neurovascular business in we believe our neurovascular business should benefit in by continued penetration of our axium coils  new product introductions  expanded geographic presence and improved pricing 
on a geographic basis  of our net sales for were generated in the united states and were generated outside the united states 
our international net sales increased to million in compared to primarily due to the launch of the axium coil  further market penetration of the everflex family of stents and the onyx liquid embolic system and the continued penetration of our atherectomy products into international markets 
we expect our international business to benefit from our ability to sell our recently launched pta balloon catheters  the evercross and the nanocross  outside the united states since we were unable to distribute invatec s balloon catheters outside the united states 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact of approximately million on our net sales compared to  principally resulting from the relationship of the us dollar as compared to the euro  but had a negative impact of approximately million on our fourth fiscal quarter net sales compared to our fourth fiscal quarter net sales 
we expect foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative impact on our net sales compared to our net sales 
as a percentage of product sales  product cost of goods sold was of product sales in compared to in in our peripheral vascular segment  product cost of goods sold as a percent of product sales decreased to in compared to in primarily attributable to manufacturing efficiencies and increased sales volumes  partially offset by costs associated with the consolidation of our redwood city manufacturing operations into our irvine and plymouth facilities 
in our neurovascular segment  product cost of goods sold as a percent of product sales was in and and was attributable to manufacturing efficiencies and increased sales volume  partially offset by additional excess and obsolete inventory reserves related to our planned product transitions to next generation devices 
we expect our product cost of goods sold as a percentage of product sales to decrease in compared to primarily as a result of anticipated better pricing  more favorable product mix  better margins on our pta balloon catheters and continued benefits from our focus on lean manufacturing programs 
although our sales  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars in compared to  such expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales 
we expect our sales  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to continue to decrease in compared to primarily as a result of our anticipated optimization of our cost structure 
we expect to continue to focus on our vital few programs and implement systems and processes to improve our sales execution 
we experienced several one time  non cash charges in during fourth fiscal quarter  we recorded an aggregate of million in non cash  asset impairment charges in our peripheral vascular segment to reduce the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets to their estimated fair values 
the impairment charges were driven primarily by the substantial disruption in the general credit and equity markets and in particular the decline in our stock price and market capitalization and certain product discontinuations during our fourth fiscal quarter 
additionally  during the second fiscal quarter  as a result of the termination of our research collaboration with merck  we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million to write off the remaining carrying value of the related merck intangible asset that was established at the time of our acquisition of foxhollow 
our net loss for was million  or per common share 
our goal for and beyond is to obtain sustained profitability 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december   an increase of million compared to the end of the third fiscal quarter this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities during the fourth fiscal quarter we believe our cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents and current financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next months 
we expect to continue to focus on improving our cash position during sales and expense components the following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses product net sales 
we derive our product net sales from the sale of endovascular devices in two primary business segments peripheral vascular and neurovascular devices 
most of our sales are generated by our global  direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world 
in countries where we do not have a direct sales force  sales are generated by shipments to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
in cases where our products are held in consignment at a customer s location  we generate sales at the time the product is used in a procedure and we are notified in writing by the hospital that the product was used  rather than at shipment 
we charge our customers for shipping and record shipping income as part of net sales 
research collaboration revenue 
research collaboration revenue was derived from our former collaboration and license agreement with merck  which we assumed as a result of our acquisition of foxhollow 
under the agreement  merck agreed to pay foxhollow million in equal installments over the initial four year term of the research collaboration  in exchange for foxhollow s agreement to collaborate exclusively with merck during such period with respect to certain fields 
under the agreement  merck also agreed to provide a minimum of million in funding to foxhollow over the first three years of the four year collaboration program term  for research activities to be conducted by foxhollow under merck s direction 
our research collaboration revenue from merck was recognized on a straight line basis over the four year term of the license exclusivity portion of the agreement and further limited to cumulative amounts due and collected at any given point under the arrangement 
for additional discussion  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
merck terminated the collaboration and license agreement effective july  during the third fiscal quarter  we reached an arrangement with merck to accomplish an orderly wind down of activities 
pursuant to this arrangement  merck will reimburse us for costs directly associated with the wind down  plus an agreed upon markup 
we recorded revenues associated with the wind down activities as services were performed

research collaboration expense 
research collaboration expense incurred as a result of our former collaboration with merck was million for sales  general and administrative expenses

table of contents related to foxhollow  an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on international operating expenses of million and million increase in non cash stock based compensation costs 
research and development expense 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense increased to in compared to in this increase was due primarily to increased spending on clinical trials and the additional activity related to our acquisition of foxhollow in amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of the amortization of intangible assets purchased in connection with our acquisition of foxhollow and the amortization of our former invatec distribution rights which we received in february  slightly offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in for additional discussion of the amortization of intangible assets purchased in connection with our acquisition of foxhollow  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
acquired in process research and development 
during fourth fiscal quarter  we recorded million in acquired in process research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative use in connection with the foxhollow acquisition 
the most significant acquired research and development projects were the next generation silverhawk project and rockhawk project which represented of the acquired research and development projects 
we attributed approximately million of fair value to the next generation silverhawk project 
the is a minimally invasive catheter system that treats peripheral artery disease by removing plaque in order to reopen narrowed or blocked arteries 
the next generation silverhawk is designed to improve the procedure time  cutting efficiency and ease of use in the existing silverhawk plaque excision system 
we expect to incur approximately million to bring the next generation silverhawk device to commercial viability 
we estimate that we will realize cash flows from the next generation silverhawk device during the second half of we attributed approximately million of fair value to the rockhawk project 
the rockhawk is designed to treat calcified lesions with a stronger blade 
in february  we received approval of the rockhawk device for surgical use in the united states 
we are currently working with the fda on a clinical trial design and investigational device exemption submission for approval of the rockhawk device for endovascular use

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our business is seasonal in nature 
historically  demand for our products has been the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in our third fiscal quarter than throughout the rest of the year as a result of the european holiday schedule during the summer months 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our net sales and gross profit among quarters  as well as within each quarter  as a result of a number of factors  including  among other things  the number and mix of products sold in the quarter  the demand for  and pricing of  our products and the products of our competitors  the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory approvals for products  costs  benefits and timing of new product introductions  increased competition  the timing and extent of promotional pricing or volume discounts  the timing of larger orders by customers and the timing of shipment of such orders  changes in average selling prices  the availability and cost of components and materials  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and restructuring  impairment and other special charges

credit facility 
our operating subsidiaries  ev endovascular  inc  ev international  inc  micro therapeutics  inc

these limitations allow us to borrow  subject to specified reserves  up to of eligible domestic and foreign accounts receivables plus up to of eligible inventory 
additionally  borrowings against the eligible inventory may not exceed the lesser of of the amount advanced against eligible accounts receivable or million 
as of december  we had million outstanding under the term loan and no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit  however  we had approximately million of outstanding letters of credit issued by silicon valley bank  which reduced the maximum amount available under our revolving line of credit to approximately million 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at a variable annual rate equal to silicon valley bank s prime rate plus 
borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable annual rate equal to silicon valley bank s prime rate plus 
silicon valley bank s prime rate at december  was 
accrued interest on any outstanding balance under the revolving line and the term loan is payable monthly in arrears 
principal amounts outstanding under the term loan are payable in consecutive equal monthly installments on the last day of each month 
both the revolving line of credit and term loan are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets  excluding intellectual property  which is subject to a negative pledge  and are guaranteed by ev inc and all of our domestic direct and indirect subsidiaries which are not borrowers

upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default  amounts due under the loan agreement may be accelerated 
we were in compliance with the covenants at december  and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
cash flows operating activities 
net cash used in operations was million in compared to million in and million in  reflecting primarily our net loss and increased working capital requirements 
in  our net loss included approximately million of non cash asset impairment charges of goodwill and other intangible assets and million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense

portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the tables above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  our operating leases are not recognized on our consolidated balance sheet 
the fasb interpretation income tax obligations of  included in the other column in the table above represent an amount of potential tax liabilities that we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by the rules and regulations of the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these arrangements 
other liquidity information the acquisition agreement relating to our purchase of appriva medical  inc requires us to make additional payments of up to an aggregate of million to the sellers of the business if certain milestones related to regulatory steps in the product commercialization process are achieved during the period of to we believe the first milestone was not achieved by the january  milestone date and that the first milestone was not payable 
in september  we announced that we had decided to discontinue the development and commercialization of the technology we acquired in the appriva transaction 
we are currently involved in litigation regarding this agreement as described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the stock purchase agreement relating to our purchase of dendron gmbh required us to make additional payments of up to million to the sellers of the business if dendron products achieved certain revenue targets between and a final payment of million was earned and accrued in and paid in pursuant to the acquisition agreement relating to foxhollow s purchase of kerberos proximal solutions  inc  foxhollow agreed to pay certain earnout payments up to an aggregate of million upon the achievement of contractually defined net sales milestones 
in august  foxhollow received a letter from counsel for the shareholder representatives of kerberos alleging that foxhollow has not used commercially 
table of contents reasonable efforts to market  promote  sell and distribute kerberos rinspirator products  as required under the agreement 
we discontinued the sale of the rinspirator products in january there can be no assurance that the stockholder representatives of kerberos will not commence litigation on the alleged claims 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors  including the extent and duration of future operating losses  the level and timing of future sales and expenditures  the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs  working capital to support our sales growth  receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  sales and marketing programs  continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace  competing technologies  market and regulatory developments  acquisitions and the future course of pending and threatened litigation 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  anticipated cash from operations and current and anticipated financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next months 
however  there is no assurance that additional funding will not be needed prior to such time 
in the event that we require additional working capital to fund future operations and any future acquisitions  we may sell shares of our common stock or other equity securities  sell debt securities  or enter into additional credit and financing arrangements with one or more independent institutional lenders 
there is no assurance that any financing transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that any financing transaction will not be dilutive to our current stockholders 
if we require additional working capital  but are not able to raise additional funds  we may be required to significantly curtail or cease ongoing operations 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
credit risk at december   our accounts receivable balance was million  compared to million at december  we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business 
we believe that concentrations of credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas 
however  a significant amount of our accounts receivable are with national healthcare systems in many countries 
although we do not currently foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables  repayment depends upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries 
as of december   no customer represented more than of our outstanding accounts receivable 
from time to time  we offer certain distributors in foreign markets who meet our credit standards extended payment terms  which may result in a longer collection period and reduce our cash flow from operations 
we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of accounts receivable from groups of customers or any particular geographic area nor experienced any material cash flow reductions as a result of offering extended payment terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our physician customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
changes in these estimates and changes in our business could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recognized in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our critical financial estimates with the audit committee and our board of directors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements 
our critical financial policies and estimates are described below revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before sales can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are met at the time of shipment when risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor  unless a consignment arrangement exists 
sales from consignment arrangements are recognized upon written notification that the product has been used by the customer indicating that a sale is complete 
our terms of sale for regular sales are typically fob shipping point  net days 
regular sales include orders from customers for replacement of customer stock  replenishment of consignment product used by customers  orders for a scheduled case surgery and stocking orders 
we may agree to extended payment terms for certain international distributors based upon their payment history  financial condition and other general financial factors 
we allow customers to return defective or damaged products for credit 
our estimate for sales returns is based upon contractual commitments and historical return experience which we analyze by geography and is recorded as a reduction of sales for the period in which the related sales occurred 
historically  our return experience has been low with return rates of less than of our net sales 
stock based compensation we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and other equity incentive awards 
the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables which include the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards  expected dividend yield  risk free interest rate and the forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected term of options based upon our historical experience 
we estimate expected volatility and forfeiture rates based on a combination of historical factors related to our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is determined using us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term 
dividend yield is estimated to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no plans of doing so in the future 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods as necessary 
we use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
generally  all stock based compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the respective requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our results of operations 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation disclosures 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain a large customer base that mitigates the risk of concentration with one customer 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowance for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding account balances and the overall quality and age of those balances not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
we write off accounts receivable when we determine that the accounts receivable are uncollectible  typically upon customer bankruptcy or the customer s non response to continuous collection efforts 
however  approximately of our receivables outstanding as of december  were from foreign distributors  which carry a potentially higher degree of collection risk due to potential disruptions in the global financial markets and a potential inability for our distributors to obtain credit to continue to operate their businesses 
in addition  if the overall condition of the health care industry were to deteriorate as a result of the recent financial and economic crisis or otherwise  resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  significant additional allowances could be required 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of accounts receivable allowances  comprised of both allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  of million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based on historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions which includes estimates of the impact of the introduction of new or enhanced products on existing inventory 
our industry is characterized by regular new product development  and as such  our inventory is at risk of obsolescence following the introduction and development of new or enhanced products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for demand also are used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our sales forecasts 
future product introductions and related inventories may require additional reserves based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding expense to cost of goods sold 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
valuation of acquired in process research and development when we acquire another company  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between acquired in process research and development  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible net assets and goodwill as required by us gaap 
in process research and development is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development and other intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates that may change over time 
during  we recorded an in process research and development charge of million related to our october acquisition of foxhollow 
the income approach was used to determine the fair values of the acquired in process research and development 
this approach establishes fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to the in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to the present value 
revenue estimates were based on relative market size  expected market growth rates and market share penetration 
gross margin estimates were based on the estimated cost of the product at the time of introduction and historical gross margins for similar products offered by us or by competitors in the marketplace 
the estimated selling  general and administrative expenses were based on historical operating expenses of the 
table of contents acquired company as well as long term expense levels based on industry comparables 
the costs to complete each project were based on estimated direct project expenses as well as the remaining labor hours and related overhead costs 
in arriving at the value of acquired in process research and development projects  we considered each project s stage of completion  the complexity of the work to be completed  the costs already incurred  the remaining costs to complete the project  the contribution of core technologies  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of acquired in process research and development as of the acquisition date was based on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
we believe that the estimated acquired in process research and development amounts determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including in process research and development  of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million related to previous acquisitions in our peripheral vascular business 
the impairment charge was driven primarily by the substantial disruption in the general credit and equity markets and in particular the decline in our stock price and market capitalization during our fourth fiscal quarter the decline in our stock price and market capitalization were primarily a result of the general market conditions and the associated increase in general market risk as well as changes in our future estimated cash flows which were significantly driven by the changes in the performance of our atherectomy business 
we have not recognized impairment of goodwill in any other year included in our consolidated statements of operations 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million and million at december  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our goodwill impairment disclosures 
other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology  patents  customer relationships and trademarks and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
we review these intangible assets for impairment during our fourth fiscal quarter or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  we recorded impairment charges of million primarily to certain other intangible assets in our peripheral vascular business acquired in previous acquisitions due to certain product discontinuations 
during the second fiscal quarter  as a result of the termination of the merck collaboration and license agreement  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million to write off the remaining carrying value of the related merck intangible asset that was established at the time of our acquisition of foxhollow 
we have not recorded an impairment of other intangible assets in any other year included in our consolidated statements of operations 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our other intangible asset impairment disclosures 
the evaluation of asset impairments related to goodwill and other intangible assets  among other things  requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the assets being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets 
table of contents will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters and indicates how any tax reserves should be classified in a balance sheet 
as a result of this standard  we recorded a charge of  which was accounted for as an increase in the january  balance of accumulated deficit 
for the year ended december   interest accrued was  which was net of federal and state tax benefits  and total unrecognized tax benefits net of deferred federal and state tax benefits was  for the year ended december   net interest accrued was  and total unrecognized tax benefits net of deferred federal and state income tax benefits were  the unrecognized tax benefits net of deferred federal and state tax benefits for and would impact the effective tax rates 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted the required provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas for financial assets and liabilities 
see note for further discussion of the impact the adoption of sfas had on our results of operations and financial condition in the implementation of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 fsp which delays the effective date of sfas for certain non financial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt these standards at the beginning of our fiscal year 
the adoption of fsp is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp which clarifies the application of sfas in an inactive market and illustrates how an entity would determine fair value when the market for a financial asset is not active 
fsp is effective immediately and applies to prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
the implementation of fsp did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised business combinations sfas no 
r and sfas no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  sfas which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  these new standards represent the completion of the fasb s first major joint project with the international accounting standards board iasb and are intended to improve  simplify and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests formerly minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt these standards at the beginning of our fiscal year 
the effect of adoption will generally be prospectively applied to transactions completed after the end of our fiscal year  although the new presentation and disclosure requirements for pre existing non controlling interests will be retrospectively applied to all prior period financial information presented 
sfas no 
r retains the underlying fair value concepts of its predecessor sfas no 
 but changes the method for applying the acquisition method in a number of significant respects  including the 
table of contents requirement to expense transaction fees and expected restructuring costs as incurred  rather than including these amounts in the allocated purchase price  the requirement to recognize the fair value of contingent consideration at the acquisition date  rather than the expected amount when the contingency is resolved  the requirement to recognize the fair value of acquired in process research and development assets at the acquisition date  rather than immediately expensing  and the requirement to recognize a gain in relation to a bargain purchase price  rather than reducing the allocated basis of long lived assets 
because this standard is generally applied prospectively  except as it relates to acquired income tax contingencies and valuation allowances  the effect of adoption on our consolidated financial statements will depend primarily on specific transactions  if any  completed after on february   the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas creates a fair value option under which an entity may elect to record certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition 
subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
the election of the fair value option would be made on a contract by contract basis and would need to be supported by concurrent documentation or a preexisting documented policy 
sfas requires an entity to separately disclose the fair value of these items on the balance sheet or in the footnotes to the financial statements and to provide information that would allow the financial statement user to understand the impact on earnings from changes in the fair value 
sfas was effective for us beginning in based upon our assessment of our financial assets and liabilities  we did not elect to implement the provisions of sfas

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  which are potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  however  our policy is to only enter into contracts that can be designated as normal purchases or sales 
interest rate risk borrowings under our revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank bear interest at a variable annual rate equal to silicon valley bank s prime rate plus 
borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable annual rate equal to silicon valley bank s prime rate plus 
we currently do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december   we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit and had million in borrowings under the term loan 
based upon this debt level  a increase in the interest rate on such borrowings would cause us to incur an increase in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
based on our annualized average interest rate  a decrease in the interest rate on such balances would result in a reduction in interest income of approximately  on an annual basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we transact business could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our net sales were denominated in foreign currencies in and  respectively 
selling  marketing and administrative costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currency  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases and when we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our price not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
approximately of our net sales denominated in foreign currencies in and were derived from european union countries and were denominated in the euro 
our principal foreign currency exchange rate risks exist between the us dollar and the euro 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated cash  receivables and payables  generating currency transaction gains or losses that impact our non operating income expense levels in the respective period and are reported in other expense income  net in our consolidated financial statements 
we recorded a million foreign currency exchange rate transaction loss in and a million foreign currency exchange rate transaction gain in  primarily related to the translation of our foreign denominated net receivables into us dollars 
historically  we have not hedged our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
during fourth fiscal quarter  however  we entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with our euro denominated accounts receivable 
the forward contract was settled prior to the end of the fourth fiscal quarter and there were no outstanding forward exchange contracts as of december  we may consider hedging our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates in the future 
at december   we had euro denominated accounts receivable and cash of approximately million and million  respectively 
a increase in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro as a result of the weakening dollar would have the effect of approximately a million foreign currency transaction gain 
a decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro as a result of the strengthening dollar would have the effect of approximately a million foreign currency transaction loss
