item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves and contingencies on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
one of the accounting policies that involves significant judgments and estimates concerns our inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the weighted average cost value 
certain items in the inventory may be considered obsolete or excess and  as such  we establish an allowance to reduce the carrying value of these items to their net realizable value 
based on estimates  assumptions and judgments made from the information available at the time  we determine the amounts of these allowances 
because inventories have  during the past few years  represented over one third of our total assets  any reduction in the value of our inventories would require us to take write offs that would affect our net worth and future earnings 
another accounting policy that involves significant judgments and estimates is our accounts receivable allowance valuation 
the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that management believes will adequately provide for credit losses 
the company uses the black scholes model to value the stock option grants which involves significant judgments and estimates
