item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that include numerous risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in this annual report on form k under special note regarding forward looking statements and under risk factors 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of international coal group  inc and its subsidiaries appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we produce  process and sell steam coal from regional mining complexes  which  as of december  were supported by active underground mines  active surface mines and preparation plants located throughout west virginia  kentucky  virginia  maryland and illinois 
we have three reportable business segments  which are based on the coal regions in which we operate i central appalachian  comprised of both surface and underground mines  ii northern appalachian  also comprised of both surface and underground mines and iii illinois basin  representing one underground mine 
for more information about our reportable business segments  please see our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
we also broker coal produced by others  the majority of which is shipped directly from the third party producer to the ultimate customer 
our steam coal sales are primarily to large utilities and industrial customers in the eastern region of the united states 
in addition  we generate other revenues from the manufacture and operation of highwall mining systems  parts sales and shop services relating to those systems and coal handling and processing fees 
icg  inc was formed by wl ross co 
llc wlr  and other investors  in may to acquire and operate competitive coal mining facilities 
international coal group  inc was formed in march and became the parent holding company pursuant to a reorganization on november  through the acquisition of key assets from the horizon bankruptcy estate  the wlr investor group was able to target properties strategically located in appalachia and the illinois basin with high quality reserves that are union free 
with the proceeds of our december public offering  we retired substantially all of our then outstanding debt 
consistent with the wlr investor group s strategy to acquire attractive coal assets  the anker and coalquest acquisitions further diversified our reserves in november our primary expenses are wages and benefits  repair and maintenance expenditures  diesel fuel purchases  blasting supplies  coal transportation costs  cost of purchased coal  royalties  freight and handling costs and taxes incurred in selling our coal 
certain trends and economic factors affecting the coal industry our revenues depend on the price at which we are able to sell our coal 
the pricing environment for domestic steam and metallurgical coal during the first three quarters of was relatively strong 
in the fourth quarter of  coal prices dropped drastically due to decreased demand for metallurgical coal caused by the global economic crisis and decreased demand for steam coal caused by high inventory levels at utilities 
we have experienced increased operating costs for fuel and explosives  steel products  tires  healthcare and labor 
while prices of labor and commodities increased over prior year  we expect that current economic conditions will reduce the inflationary pressures that drove up such costs in however  we expect to experience higher costs for surety bonds and letters of credit

risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used 
our actual results have generally not differed materially from our estimates 
however  we monitor such differences and  in the event that actual results are significantly different from those estimated  we disclose any related impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
note to our audited consolidated financial statements provides a description of significant accounting policies 
we believe that of these significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
table of contents revenue recognition coal revenues result from sales contracts long term coal agreements or purchase orders with electric utilities  industrial companies or other coal related organizations  primarily in the eastern united states 
revenue is recognized and recorded at the time of shipment or delivery to the customer  at fixed or determinable prices and the title or risk of loss has passed in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
under the typical terms of these agreements  risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port  where coal is loaded to the rail  barge  truck or other transportation sources that deliver coal to its destination 
coal sales revenues also result from the sale of brokered coal produced by others 
revenue is recognized and recorded at the time of shipment or delivery to the customer  prices are fixed or determinable and the title or risk of loss has passed in accordance with the terms of the sale agreement 
the revenues related to brokered coal sales are included in coal sales revenues on a gross basis and the corresponding cost of the coal from the supplier is recorded in cost of coal sales in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
freight and handling costs paid to third party carriers and invoiced to coal customers are recorded as freight and handling costs and freight and handling revenues  respectively 
other revenues primarily consist of contract mining income  coalbed methane sales  ash disposal services  equipment and parts sales  equipment rebuild and maintenance services  royalties and coal handling and processing income 
with respect to other revenues recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal  we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
advance payments received are deferred and recognized in revenue as related income is earned 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we establish provisions for losses on accounts receivable when it is probable that all or part of the outstanding balance will not be collected 
management regularly reviews collectability and establishes or adjusts the allowance as necessary 
although we believe the estimate of credit losses we have made is reasonable and appropriate  inability to collect outstanding accounts receivable amounts could materially impact our reported financial results 
reclamation our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
we record these reclamation obligations according to the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which the legal obligation associated with the retirement of the long lived asset is incurred 
fair value of reclamation liabilities is determined based on the present value of the estimated future expenditures 
when the liability is initially recorded  the offset is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the assumptions used to estimate the liability do not materialize as expected or regulatory changes were to occur  reclamation costs or obligations to perform reclamation and mine closing activities could be materially different than currently estimated 
to settle the liability  the obligation is paid  and to the extent there is a difference between the liability and the amount of cash paid  a gain or loss upon settlement is recorded 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current liabilities 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  as of december   we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closure is approximately million 
advance royalties we are required  under certain royalty lease agreements  to make minimum royalty payments whether or not mining activity is being performed on the leased property 
these minimum payments may be recoupable once mining begins on the leased property 
the recoupable minimum royalty payments are capitalized and amortized based on the units of production method at a rate defined in the lease agreement once mining activities begin 
unamortized deferred royalty costs are expensed when mining has ceased or a decision is made not to mine on such property 
we have recorded an allowance for such circumstances based upon management estimates 
we believe the estimate for losses is appropriate 
however  actual amounts that we recoup through mining activity could vary resulting in a material impact to our financial results 
inventories coal inventories are stated at lower of average cost or market and represent coal contained in stockpiles  including those tons that have been mined and hauled to our loadout facilities  but not yet shipped to customers 
these inventories are stated in clean coal equivalent tons and take into account any loss that may occur during the processing stage 
coal must be of a quality that can be sold on existing sales orders to be carried as coal inventory 
coal inventory volumes are determined through survey procedures 
the surveys involve assumptions  inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
parts and supplies inventories are valued at average cost  less an allowance for obsolescence 
we establish provisions for losses in parts and supplies inventory values through analysis of turnover of inventory items and adjust the allowance as necessary 
although we believe the estimates we have made with respect to the valuation of our coal and parts and supplies inventories are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions coal inventories or actual utilization of items parts and supplies inventories could materially impact our reported financial results 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization property  plant  equipment and mine development  which includes coal lands and mineral rights  are recorded at cost  which includes construction overhead and interest  where applicable 
expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
coal lands and mineral rights are depleted using the units of production method  based on estimated recoverable interest 
the coal lands and mineral rights fair values are established by either using engineering studies or market values as established when coal lands and mineral rights are purchased on the open market 
these values are then evaluated as to the number of recoverable tons contained in a particular mining area 
once the coal lands and mineral rights values are established  and the number of recoverable tons contained in a particular coal lands and mineral rights area is determined  a units of production depletion rate can be calculated 
this rate is then utilized to calculate depletion expense for each period mining is conducted on a particular coal lands and mineral rights area 
any uncertainty surrounding the application of the depletion policy is directly related to the assumptions as to the number of recoverable tons contained in a particular coal lands and mineral rights area 
the amount of compensation paid for the coal lands and mineral rights is a set amount  however  the recoverable tons contained in the coal lands and mineral rights area are based on engineering estimates which can  and often do  change as the tons are mined 
any change in the number of recoverable tons contained in a coal lands and mineral rights area will result in a change in the depletion rate and corresponding depletion expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of depletion expense 
mine development costs are amortized using the units of production method  based on estimated recoverable tons in the same manner described above 
other property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives 
coal reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of economically recoverable coal reserves  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists 
reserve estimates are periodically updated to reflect past coal production  new drilling information and other geologic or mining data 
acquisitions  sales or dispositions of coal properties will also change the reserves 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include i geological conditions  ii historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  iii the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  iv assumptions governing future prices  and v future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
at december   we had billion tons of coal reserves 
goodwill as a result of a prior acquisition  we had assigned goodwill to our addcar reporting unit based upon its estimated fair value 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually  and more frequently if a triggering event occurs 
we perform our impairment test as of october each year 
the goodwill impairment test consists of two steps 
the first identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using present value techniques  such as discounted cash flows of projected future operations developed by management or a weighting of income and market approaches 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not necessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step is necessary to measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
implied fair value of goodwill is determined as the amount that the fair value of the assets of a business unit exceeds their carrying value  excluding goodwill 
impairment loss is measured as the amount of the carrying value of goodwill that exceeds its implied fair value 
we performed an impairment test of goodwill related to our addcar subsidiary as of october  the results of the annual impairment test indicated that its estimated fair value was less than the carrying amount of the respective business unit assets  including goodwill  and  therefore  was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value 
subsequent to this impairment charge  we have no goodwill remaining as of december  asset impairments we follow sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires that projected future cash flows from use and disposition of assets be compared with the carrying amounts of those assets when impairment indicators are present 
when the sum of projected cash flows is less than the carrying amount  impairment losses are indicated 
if the fair value of the assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recognized 
in determining such impairment losses  discounted cash flows or asset appraisals are utilized to determine the fair value of the assets being evaluated 
also  in certain situations  expected mine lives are shortened because of changes to planned operations 
when that occurs and it is determined that the mine s underlying costs are not recoverable in the future  reclamation and mine closing obligations are accelerated and the mine closing accrual is increased accordingly 
to the extent it is determined asset carrying values will not be recoverable during a shorter mine life  a provision for such impairment is recognized 
recognition of an impairment will decrease asset values  increase operating expenses and decrease net income 
in december  we made the decision to permanently close our sago mine during the first quarter of upon making this decision  we performed an impairment test of related mine development costs  which resulted in a million non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value 
there were no other impairment charges related to long lived assets recognized in as a result of our impairment tests 

table of contents derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 
 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 the effectiveness of each hedging relationship is assessed both at hedge inception and at each reporting period thereafter 
also  at the end of each reporting period  ineffectiveness in the hedging relationships is measured as the difference between the change in fair value of the derivative instruments and the change in fair value of either the hedged items fair value hedges or expected cash flows cash flow hedges 
ineffectiveness  if any  is recorded in interest expense 
we have not designated our derivatives as hedging instruments and we recognize changes in the fair value of our derivatives in earnings in the period of change 
we enter into coal supply contracts with many of our customers 
certain of these agreements meet the definition of a derivative under sfas no 
we analyze these agreements for qualification for the normal purchase  normal sale exception under the standard 
we enter into the contracts with the intent to supply the related coal and do not trade the contracts 
if we change our intentions with respect to delivery on or operation of these contracts  the accounting for the contracts could change 
coal supply agreements we have allocated purchase price to below market coal supply agreements acquired in acquisitions accounted for as business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  value was allocated to coal supply agreements based on discounted cash flows attributable to the difference between the below market contract price and the prevailing market price at the date of acquisition and was capitalized and is being amortized on the basis of coal to be shipped over the term of the contracts 
determination of fair value requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based awards in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation expense is generally measured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award 
we utilize restricted stock and stock options as part of our stock based compensation program 
determining fair value requires us to make a number of assumptions  including expected term  risk free rate and expected volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
debt issuance costs debt issuance costs reflect fees incurred to obtain financing 
debt issuance costs related to our outstanding debt are amortized over the life of the related debt 
from time to time  we write off deferred financing fees as a result of amending or canceling related credit agreements 
such write offs could be material and occur in the period that the decision to amend or cancel the related credit agreement is made 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the timing of the realization of deferred tax liabilities  the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if future taxable income is lower than expected or if expected tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the determination is made 
postretirement medical benefits some of our subsidiaries have long and short term liabilities for postretirement benefit cost obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
liabilities for postretirement benefits are not funded 
the liability is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits 
the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
the discount rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement medical benefits was for the year ended december  we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree healthcare and work related injury and illness obligations 
the future healthcare cost trend rate represents the rate at which healthcare costs are expected to increase over the life of the plan 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are determined primarily based upon our  and our predecessor s  historical rate of change in retiree healthcare costs 
the postretirement expense in the operating period ended december  was based on an assumed heath care inflationary rate of in the operating period decreasing to in  which represents the ultimate healthcare cost trend rate for the remainder of the plan life 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed ultimate healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the year ended december  by million and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed ultimate healthcare cost trend rate would decrease the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the year ended december  by million and decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected or if regulatory changes were to occur  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 

table of contents workers compensation workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain personal injuries due to job related accidents are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs and  on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer fatal injuries receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee who is injured in the course of employment or the beneficiary of an employee that suffers fatal injuries in the course of employment 
our operations are covered through a combination of participation in a state run program and insurance policies 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts using a discount rate of as of december  the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our workers compensation liability would increase by approximately million 
if we were to increase our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our workers compensation liability would decrease by approximately million 
at december   we have recorded an accrual of million for workers compensation benefits 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
coal workers pneumoconiosis we are responsible under various federal statutes  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible employees resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
our operations are covered through a combination of participation in a state run program and insurance policies 
we accrue for any self insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts using a discount rate of as of december  the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our black lung benefit liability would increase by approximately million 
if we were to increase our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our black lung benefit liability would decrease by approximately million 
at december   we have recorded an accrual of million for black lung benefits 
individual losses in excess of million at the state level and million at the federal level are covered by our large deductible stop loss insurance 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal act provides for the funding of health benefits for certain union retirees and their spouses or dependants 
the coal act established the combined fund into which employers who are signatory operators and related persons are obligated to pay annual premiums for beneficiaries 
the coal act also created a second benefit fund for miners who retired between july  and september  and whose former employers are no longer in business 
upon the consummation of the business combination with anker  we assumed anker s coal act liabilities  which were estimated to be million at december  actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts using a discount rate of as of december  the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our coal act liability would increase by approximately million 
if we were to increase our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our coal act liability would decrease by approximately million 
prior to the business combination with anker  we did not have any liability under the coal act 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues  coal sales revenues by operating segment and tons sold by operating segment the following table depicts revenues for the years ended december  and for the indicated categories year ended december  increase decrease or tons in thousands  except percentages and per ton data coal sales revenues freight and handling revenues other revenues total revenues tons sold coal sales revenue per ton the following table depicts coal sales revenues by operating segment for years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages central appalachian northern appalachian illinois basin ancillary total coal sales revenues the following table depicts tons sold by operating segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease tons in thousands  except percentages central appalachian northern appalachian illinois basin ancillary total tons sold coal sales revenues coal sales revenues are derived from sales of produced coal and brokered coal contracts 
coal sales revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to a increase in sales realization per ton resulting from increased spot market and short term contract sales entered into in order to capitalize on favorable market conditions during the first three quarters of further impacting the increase in coal sales revenue was a increase in tons sold compared to the same period of partially offsetting the impact of improved realization per ton and the increase in tons sold was a decrease in coal sales revenues attributable to the expiration of certain brokered coal contracts 
central appalachian 
coal sales revenues from our central appalachian segment for the year ended december  increased over the same period in primarily due to an increase of per ton  which was driven by higher average prices of our coal sold pursuant to short term supply agreements and on the spot market  including increased sales of metallurgical coal  primarily from increased production at our new beckley operation 
northern appalachian 
for the year ended december   our northern appalachian coal sales revenues increased due to an increase of per ton resulting from higher average prices of coal sold pursuant to coal supply agreements and from an increase in sales of metallurgical coal  particularly on the spot market which provided advantageous pricing throughout much of additionally  we experienced an increase in tons sold at certain of our complexes 
the increase in tons sold was mainly attributable to our sentinel complex continuing to increase production output to target levels  the ramp up of production at the formerly idled harrison operation during and increased production resulting from investments in capital improvements made during the year 
illinois basin 
the increase in coal sales revenues from our illinois basin segment was due to a increase in tons sold resulting from increased short term contract sales 
ancillary 
our ancillary segment s coal sales revenues are comprised of coal sold under brokered coal contracts 
we experienced a decrease in tons sold due to the expiration of certain brokered coal contracts 

table of contents freight and handling revenues freight and handling revenues represent reimbursement of freight and handling costs for certain shipments for which we initially pay the costs and are then reimbursed by the customer 
freight and handling revenues and costs increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to increased fuel surcharges and transportation rates 
additionally  we have entered into new sales contracts during that have increased freight and handling revenues and costs 
other revenues the increase in other revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to additional ash disposal income  royalty income  sales of scrap materials  contract mining revenues and an increase in revenue generated from coalbed methane wells owned jointly by our subsidiary  coalquest  and cdx 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our addcar subsidiary  primarily related to the sale of a narrow bench highwall mining system in

central appalachian 
cost of coal sales from our central appalachian segment increased to per ton for the year ended december  from per ton for the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased labor and diesel fuel costs 
labor and benefit costs increased due to a tightening labor market resulting in the need to offer more competitive compensation packages 
diesel fuel costs increased over prior period as a result of higher per gallon fuel costs and additional gallons used 
further impacting the increase in cost of coal sales were increases in repairs and maintenance costs  contract labor costs  royalties  severance taxes and reclamation costs 
northern appalachian 
our northern appalachian segment cost of coal sales per ton increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to increased labor  diesel fuel and repairs and maintenance costs resulting from certain high dollar repairs performed during additionally  royalties  severance taxes and trucking costs increased at our northern appalachian segment primarily due to increased coal sales 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in purchased coal costs due to increased production at our vindex and sentinel complexes 
illinois basin 
for the year ended december   our illinois basin cost of coal sales increased by per ton primarily due to increased labor  roof control supplies and repairs and maintenance costs 
labor increased as demand for skilled miners increased over roof control supplies increased as prices for steel were escalated for much of additionally  repairs and maintenance costs have increased due to several repairs on underground mining equipment during partially offsetting the aforementioned increases was a decrease in royalty expense resulting from increased mining of owned reserves rather than leased reserves as compared to ancillary 
cost of coal sales from our ancillary segment decreased for the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease in purchased coal costs related to the expiration of certain brokered coal contracts 

table of contents cost of other revenues for the year ended december   cost of other revenues increased primarily due to increases in labor and benefits  ash disposal transportation costs  gathering fees related to coalbed methane wells owned jointly by our subsidiary  coalquest  and cdx and highwall miner expenses 
partially offsetting the increases were the sale of a narrow bench highwall mining system by our subsidiary addcar in with no comparable sale in and decreased water treatment costs at a non producing property 
depreciation  depletion and amortization the principal component of the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was a decrease in amortization income on below market coal agreements 
additionally  there were increases in depletion expense and depreciation expense due to significant additions to property  plant  equipment and mine development during these increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of coalbed methane well development costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased primarily due to increases in bad debt expense  labor and benefit costs  sales tax expense and legal settlements 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in taxes and licenses and legal and professional fees 
gain on sale of assets gain on sale of assets for related primarily to exchanges of property  the sale of a used highwall mining system and the disposition of other assets 
the gain recognized in was primarily attributable to the sale of the denmark property 
impairment loss the impairment loss reflects the write off of goodwill in associated with our addcar subsidiary  as a result of the negative impact of several contributing factors which resulted in a reduction in the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value 
during  all goodwill associated with our hazard  knott county  east kentucky and eastern subsidiaries was deemed to be impaired and written off 
additionally  as a result of making the decision to close the sago mine  related development costs were deemed to be impaired and were written off during no comparable impairment occurred during the prior year 

table of contents adjusted ebitda by operating segment adjusted ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment charges and minority interest 
adjusted ebitda is presented because it is an important supplemental measure of our performance used by our chief operating decision maker in such areas as capital investment and allocation of resources 
it is considered adjusted as we adjust ebitda for impairment charges and minority interest 
other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda is reconciled to its most comparable gaap measure on page of this annual report on form k and in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the following table depicts operating segment adjusted ebitda for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages central appalachian northern appalachian illinois basin ancillary total adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda from our central appalachian segment for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  primarily due to a million pre tax gain on an exchange of coal reserves 
the increase was further impacted by an increase of approximately  tons sold and an increase in profit margins of per ton over prior year 
the increase in adjusted ebitda from our northern appalachian segment was due to a combination of an increase in sales realizations of per ton  resulting in increased profit margins of per ton  as well as an increase of approximately  tons sold 
adjusted ebitda from our illinois basin segment decreased during the year ended december  related to increases in operating costs with a less significant corresponding increase in sales realizations 
the increased costs resulted in a decrease in profit margins of per ton compared to the year ended december  the decrease in adjusted ebitda from our ancillary segment was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the denmark property that occurred during also  there was a decrease of approximately  tons sold related to the expiration of brokered coal contracts  partially offset by increased profit margins of per ton

coal sales revenues are derived from sales of produced coal and brokered coal contracts 
coal sales revenues decreased million for the year ended december   or  compared to this decrease was due to a decrease in tons sold in compared to that resulted from a decrease of approximately million tons sold related to the idling  closure or cutback of production at mines in as discussed below and the expiration of certain brokered coal contracts  as well as geologic issues at several other mines 
the decrease in coal sales revenue from decreased sales tons was further impacted by a per ton reduction in sales realization of our coal primarily sold pursuant to coal supply agreements 
these decreases were partially offset by a million ton increase in tons sold from new mines that commenced full production in and from mines that experienced a full year of production in freight and handling revenues 
freight and handling revenues represent dollar for dollar reimbursement for shipments from certain of our operations for which we initially pay the freight and handling costs and are then reimbursed by the customer 
freight and handling revenues and costs increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to due to an increase in shipments from locations operating under such agreements  as well as increased transportation rates and fuel surcharges 
other revenues 
other revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was due to million of revenue generated from coalbed methane wells owned jointly by our subsidiary  coalquest  and cdx  as well as increased revenue of million from our highwall mining activities and shop services and million from the sale of a narrow bench highwall mining system by addcar 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in plant processing revenue of million 
additionally  we recognized a million gain in related to the termination of a contractual coal delivery obligation 
no comparable gain was recognized in

the decrease in sales realization was partially offset by an increase in tons sold of approximately million  or  over due to various mines  principally at our eastern and raven locations  significantly increasing or reaching full production in for the year ended december   our northern appalachian coal sales revenues increased approximately million  or  as compared to due to an increase in sales realization of per ton as segment operations benefited from favorable pricing from its coal supply agreements  as well as an increase in sales of metallurgical coal at prevailing market prices 
tons sold from our northern appalachian operations remained constant as compared to the prior year 
coal sales revenues from our illinois basin segment increased approximately million  or  as compared to due to an increase in coal sales revenue of per ton resulting from more favorable terms on its coal supply agreements 
our ancillary segment s coal sales revenues are comprised of coal sold under brokered coal contracts 
we experienced a decrease of million  or  due to a decrease of million tons primarily resulting from the expiration of brokered coal contracts

for the year ended december   our total cost of coal sales decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of coal sales was primarily the result of a decrease in tons sold as described above which was partially offset by a increase in cost per ton 
mining operations that significantly increased or reached full production in at our east mac and nellie  flint ridge deep  raven  mt 
sterling  guston run  crown surface  imperial  sentinel  county line and middle fork mines increased cost of coal sales by million

cost of coal sales at existing mines  as well as from brokered coal contracts  decreased million  primarily as a result of a million ton decrease in coal sales 
cost of coal sales per ton increased to for the year ended december  compared to in  an increase of 
the increase was mainly due to a per ton increase in the average cost of produced coal sold 
the increase in cost per ton of produced coal was caused by increases of per ton in labor and benefit costs  per ton in contract labor  per ton insurance and worker s compensation costs  per ton in fuel  oil and lubricants  per ton in blending material  per ton in insurance  and per ton in roof control supplies 
the increases were partially offset by decreases of per ton in equipment and vehicle lease costs 
purchased coal increased per ton  resulting in an increase of per ton in the average cost of coal sold 
cost of other revenues 
for the year ended december   cost of other revenues increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  of the increase  approximately million was due to costs related to addcar s sales of mining equipment during the year and exploration and development of coalbed methane resulted in an additional increase of million 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the principal component of the increase was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  related to increased property and equipment purchased to improve efficiency at existing operations and to equip new mine developments 
additional increases in depreciation and amortization expense were due to coalbed methane well development costs of million 
the increases were partially offset by an increase in amortization income on below market coal supply agreements of million during the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily attributable to gifts aggregating million made in to the families of the thirteen miners involved in the sago mine accident  partially offset by an increase of million in professional and legal fees 
net gain on sale of assets 
net gain on sale of assets increased million for the year ended december  from  primarily due to a gain of approximately million related to the sale of our denmark property in the third quarter of goodwill impairment loss 
the goodwill impairment loss reflects the negative impact of several contributing factors which resulted in a reduction in the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value 
these factors include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the sales price of coal through our annual measurement date  increases in the cost of diesel fuel  explosives  tires  roofbolts and other materials used in mining coal  increased labor costs due to tightening labor markets  significant investments in the areas of safety and compliance and increased interest rates contributing to a higher discount rate 
furthermore  the business  regulatory and marketplace environments in which we currently operate differs significantly from the historical environments that drove the business cases used to value and record the acquisition of these business units 
accordingly  we have been unable to attain the forecasted projections that were used to initially value the business units at the date of acquisition 
the goodwill impairment losses were at the following business units million at hazard  million at eastern  million at east kentucky and million at knott county 

table of contents adjusted ebitda by segment adjusted ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment charges and minority interest 
adjusted ebitda is presented because it is an important supplemental measure of our performance used by our chief operating decision maker in such areas as capital investment and allocation of resources 
it is considered adjusted as we adjust ebitda for impairment charges and minority interest 
adjusted ebitda is calculated differently than the prior year in that it includes an adjustment for impairment charges 
no impairment charges were incurred in the prior year 
other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda is reconciled to its most comparable gaap measure on page of this annual report on form k and in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the following table depicts segment adjusted ebitda for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages central appalachian northern appalachian illinois basin ancillary total adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda from our central appalachian segment decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the decreased realization per ton as discussed above 
also impacting the decrease were inflated operating costs per ton primarily resulting from regulatory issues and short term mine constraints 
the reduced realizations and increased costs resulted in a decrease in profit margins of per ton 
additionally  activities incidental to our coal producing activities decreased by million in further contributing to the decrease in adjusted ebitda 
the increase in adjusted ebitda from our northern appalachian segment of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in coal sales revenue as of per ton and decreased costs of per ton resulting in increased profit margins of per ton 
adjusted ebitda from our illinois basin segment increased million during the year ended december  due to a per ton increase in sales realization over with cost per ton remaining constant with prior year 
the increase in adjusted ebitda from our ancillary segment of million was primarily due to the sale of the denmark property in september  which resulted in a gain of million  as well as from increased contributions to income from our investment in coalbed methane wells and from our addcar subsidiary as discussed above 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in adjusted ebitda resulting from the expiration of brokered coal contracts

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial capital expenditures for  among other things  purchasing and upgrading equipment used in developing and mining our coal lands  as well as remaining in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
our principal liquidity requirements are to finance our coal production  fund capital expenditures and service our debt and reclamation obligations 
we may also engage in acquisitions from time to time 
our primary sources of liquidity to meet these needs are cash flows from sales of our coal  other income  borrowings under our senior credit facility  the proceeds of our convertible notes offering and capital equipment financing arrangements 
we believe the principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash position and remaining availability under our credit facility 
as of december   our available liquidity was million  including cash of million and million available for borrowing under our million senior credit facility 
total debt represented of our total capitalization at december  our total capitalization represents our current and long term debt combined with our total stockholders equity 
in february  we executed an amendment to our million credit facility that affected certain debt covenants 
the amendment modified the maximum permitted leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios 
the amendment also decreased the maximum capital spending and added a minimum liquidity requirement 
debt covenants for years subsequent to were not affected by the amendment 
the recent and unprecedented disruption in the current credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions 
at this time  our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment 
see risk factors the duration or severity of the current global financial crisis are uncertain and may have an impact on our business and financial conditions in ways that we currently cannot predict

the convertible notes may become convertible again in the future under certain conditions 
accordingly  we will reassess the convertibility on a quarterly basis 
we currently expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately million in  substantially all of which will be for equipment and infrastructure at our existing operations 
cash paid for capital expenditures was approximately million for the year ended december  we have funded and will continue to fund these capital expenditures from our internal operations and with proceeds from our convertible notes offering in we believe that these sources of capital and our million equipment revolving credit facility with caterpillar financial services corporation will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital expenditures under our current budget plan through the end of although we expect to experience some periods of tightening liquidity availability  we expect to be able to manage through such periods 
to the extent necessary  management believes it has flexibility in the timing of the cash requirements by managing the pace of capital spending 
in addition  management may from time to time raise additional capital through the disposition of non core assets or engaging in sale leaseback transactions 
the need and timing of seeking additional capital in the future will be subject to market conditions 
approximately million of cash paid for capital expenditures was attributable to central appalachian operations 
this amount represents investments of approximately million in our beckley mining complex  as well as additional investments of million for upgrades at the remaining central appalachian operations 
we paid approximately million at our northern appalachian operations in the year ended december   approximately million of which was for development of our sentinel and tygart properties 
expenditures of approximately million for our illinois basin operations were for ongoing operations improvements 
approximately million of cash paid for capital expenditures for the year ended december  was within our ancillary segment for safety equipment  as well as for upgrades at various other subsidiaries 
as a result of recent accidents in the mining industry  additional regulatory requirements were promulgated that will require additional capital expenditures to meet enhanced safety standards 
for the year ended december   we spent million to meet these standards and anticipate spending an additional million in

the convertible notes became convertible at the option of holders beginning july  the conversion period expired on september  pursuant to the terms of the governing indenture with no holders exercising their conversion rights 
the convertible notes may become convertible again in the future under certain conditions 
accordingly  we will reassess the convertibility on a quarterly basis 

table of contents the principal amount of the convertible notes is payable in cash and amounts above the principal amount  if any  will be convertible into shares of our common stock or  at our option  cash 
the convertible notes are convertible at an initial conversion price  subject to adjustment  of per share approximating shares per one thousand dollar principal amount of the convertible notes 
the volume weighted average price of our stock subsequent to the expiration date of the conversion period was below per share 
accordingly  there were no potentially convertible shares at december  the convertible notes are convertible upon the occurrence of certain events  including i prior to february  during any calendar quarter after september   if the closing sale price per share of our common stock for each of or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter  ii prior to february  during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price for the notes on each day during such five trading day period was equal to or less than of the closing sale price of our common stock on such day multiplied by the then current conversion rate  iii upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  and iv at any time from  and including february  until the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding august  in addition  upon events defined as a fundamental change under the convertible notes indenture  we may be required to repurchase the convertible notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the fundamental change repurchase date 
as such  in the event of a fundamental change or the aforementioned average pricing thresholds are met  we would be required to classify the entire amount outstanding of the convertible notes as a current liability in the following quarter 
in the event that a significant number of the holders of the convertible notes were to convert their notes prior to maturity  we may not have enough available funds at any particular time to make the required repayments 
under these circumstances  we would look to wlr  our banking group and other potential lenders to obtain short term funding until such time that we could secure necessary financing on a long term basis 
the availability of any such financing would depend upon the circumstances at the time  including the terms of any such financing  and other factors 
in addition  if conversion occurs in connection with certain changes in control  we may be required to deliver additional shares of our common stock a make whole premium by increasing the conversion rate with respect to such notes 
senior notes

the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  issue preferred stock  pay dividends  repurchase  repay or redeem our capital stock  make certain investments  sell assets and incur liens 
as of december   we were in compliance with our covenants under the indenture 
credit facility 
in  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit facility consisting of a revolving credit facility which matures on june  in july  concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes  we further amended the amended credit facility to reduce the commitments thereunder to million  of which a maximum of million may be used for letters of credit 
the amendment  among other things  modified the maximum permitted leverage ratio  the minimum interest coverage ratio and the maximum amount of capital expenditures permitted 
further  the amendment revised certain interest rate thresholds and unused commitment fee levels under the amended credit facility 
in february  we executed a further amendment to the amended credit facility that affected certain debt covenants 
the amendment modified the maximum permitted leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios 
the amendment also decreased the maximum capital spending and added a minimum liquidity requirement 
debt covenants for years subsequent to were not affected by the amendment 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding and letters of credit totaling million outstanding  leaving million available for future borrowing capacity 
interest on the borrowings under the amended credit facility is payable  at our option  at either the base rate plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio of to as of december  or libor plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio of to as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the amended credit facility

table of contents other as a regular part of our business  we review opportunities for  and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning  the acquisition of coal mining assets and interests in coal mining companies  and acquisitions of  or combinations with  coal mining companies 
when we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our growth plans and our acquisition criteria  we will make bids or proposals and or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements  which may be binding or nonbinding  that are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if  among other things  we are not satisfied with the results of our due diligence investigation 
any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
additionally  we have other long term liabilities  including  but not limited to  mine reclamation and mine closure costs  below market coal supply agreements and black lung costs  and some of our subsidiaries have long term liabilities relating to retiree health and other employee benefits 
our ability to meet our long term debt obligations will depend upon our future performance  which  in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulation factors that are largely beyond our control 
based upon our current operations  we believe that cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds will be adequate for at least through the end of for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and for funding anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
although we expect to experience some periods of tightening liquidity availability  we expect to be able to manage through such periods 
to the extent necessary  management believes it has flexibility in the timing of the cash requirements by managing the pace of capital spending 
in addition  management may from time to time raise additional capital through the disposition of non core assets or engaging in sale leaseback transactions

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
federal and state laws require us to secure payment of certain long term obligations  such as mine closure and reclamation costs  federal and state workers compensation  coal leases and other obligations 
we typically secure these payment obligations by using surety bonds  an off balance sheet instrument 
the use of surety bonds is less expensive than posting an all cash bond or a bank letter of credit  either of which would require a greater use of our credit facility 
we then use bank letters of credit to secure our surety bonding obligations as a lower cost alternative than securing those bonds with cash 
we currently have a million committed bonding facility pursuant to which we are required to provide bank letters of credit in an amount up to of the aggregate bond liability 
recently  surety bond costs have increased  while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure our reclamation obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral 
as of december   we had outstanding surety bonds with third parties for post mining reclamation totaling million  plus million for miscellaneous purposes 
as of december   we maintained letters of credit totaling million to secure reclamation surety bonds and other obligations

table of contents convertible debt 
in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
fsp apb requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
to allocate the proceeds from a convertible debt offering in this manner  a company would first need to determine the carrying amount of the liability component  which would be based on the fair value of a similar liability excluding any embedded conversion options 
the resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period during which the debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  and would be applied retrospectively for all periods presented
