item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
highlights our fiscal net sales of million represented an increase of over fiscal levels 
sales in our firearm core business increased by to approximately million 
net loss for fiscal of million was significantly impacted by an impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets of million  net of deferred taxes of million 
excluding this item  net income for fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal net income 
net income was affected by numerous factors  including the following despite weakness in the overall economy  our handgun and tactical rifle sales experienced growth throughout the first half of fiscal we began to experience very strong consumer demand for our handguns and tactical rifle products beginning in our third fiscal quarter 
we believe this increased demand was related to multiple factors  including heightened fears of terrorism and crime  speculation surrounding increased gun control  and a new administration taking office in washington  dc we are unable to assess whether or for how long the increase in consumer demand will last or whether the orders constituting our backlog will be cancelled if consumer demand decreases 
the demand for these products was much larger than our ability to produce  and our backlog grew from million in our second quarter to more than million in our third quarter to more than million at the end of our fiscal year 
excluding the impact of hunting products  sales for fiscal grew over sales for similar products in fiscal during fiscal  we experienced a significant decline in demand for our hunting products  including bolt action hunting rifles  fixed barrel black powder firearms  and related parts and accessories 
hunting firearm sales declined by more than for the fiscal year ended april   and we recorded an impairment charge relating to our hunting business of million  less related deferred tax liabilities of million  resulting in a million adverse impact to after tax profits 
among other things  we attribute the weakness in our hunting products to the severe weakness in the economy  excess levels of hunting product inventory in the sporting good distribution channel  and the premium nature of the hunting products we offer 
we have taken a number of actions to address the weak demand for our hunting products and to reduce the losses we have been incurring  including the introduction of lower price point products in an effort to reach a larger segment of the market  moving from a direct sales force to a manufacturers representative model  and instituting cost cutting initiatives and workforce reductions 
our business we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of firearms 
we manufacture a wide array of pistols  revolvers  tactical rifles  hunting rifles  black powder firearms  handcuffs  and firearm related products and accessories for sale to a wide variety of customers  including gun enthusiasts  collectors  hunters  sportsmen  competitive shooters  protection focused individuals  law enforcement agencies and officers  and military agencies in the united states and throughout the world 
we are the largest manufacturer of handguns and handcuffs in the united states  the largest us exporter of handguns  and a growing participant in the tactical and hunting rifle markets that we recently entered 
we manufacture these products at our facilities in springfield  massachusetts  houlton  maine  and rochester  new hampshire 
in addition  we pursue opportunities to license our name and trademarks to third parties for use in association with their products and services 
we plan to substantially increase our product offerings and our licensing program to leverage the plus year old smith wesson brand and capitalize on the goodwill developed through our historic american tradition by expanding consumer awareness of products we produce or license in the safety  security  protection  and sport markets 
key performance indicators we evaluate the performance of our business based upon operating profit  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses  and certain components of other income and expense 
we also use adjusted ebitdas earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense  excluding large non recurring items to evaluate our performance 
we evaluate our various product lines by such measurements as cost per unit produced  units produced per day  and incoming orders per day 
key industry data handguns have been subject to legislative actions in the past  and the market has reacted to these actions 
there was a substantial increase in sales in the early s during the period leading up to and shortly after the enactment of the brady bill 
in the period from through  the us handgun market increased by over  as consumers purchased handguns in fear of prohibition of handgun ownership 
the market levels then returned to pre levels and have remained relatively unchanged until late in calendar when the market increased in what appears to be fears surrounding crime and terrorism  an economic downturn  and a change in the white house administration 
like with the increase in  we expect this current increase in the market to be temporary in nature and expect that the market will return to normal levels at some point 
within the us handgun market  we estimate that approximately of the market is pistols and is revolvers 
we also estimate that we have approximately a share of the us consumer market for handguns 
this compares with approximately in the period just before we acquired smith wesson corp 
in it also compares favorably with market share figures of the s when we had an estimated market share 
results of operations net product and services sales the following table sets forth certain information relative to net sales for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change revolvers pistols walther tactical rifles premium products hunting firearms parts accessories total firearms handcuffs specialty services other non firearms total fiscal net product and services sales compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased on strong consumer driven growth in handguns and tactical rifles 
excluding hunting products  firearm unit sales increased by over the prior year to approximately  units 
revolver sales were driven primarily by consumer demand  however  because this product is much more capital intensive  the growth year over year is smaller than in other handgun product lines 
pistol sales increased on strong demand for sigmas and m p  with sales for those product lines up and  respectively  over the prior year 
walther sales increased significantly over the prior year as a result of higher sales of the p pistol and the full year benefit of the pps pistol  which was introduced in fiscal walther ppk pistol sales were suspended in the fourth quarter of fiscal because of the february recall of this product  adversely impacting fourth quarter sales 
tactical rifle sales continued to increase as a result of increased consumer demand  as well as continued acceptance by law enforcement agencies 
to date  police and security agencies have either selected the m p or approved the m p for on duty use 
hunting firearms have been severely impacted by economic factors  with black powder dropping from fiscal levels 
the decrease in parts and accessories correlated to the decrease in black powder rifle sales 
non firearm sales for fiscal were flat with increased handcuff sales offset by reduced foundry sales 
the order backlog at the end of fiscal was  which was  higher than at the end of fiscal and  higher than at the end of our previous fiscal quarter 
the extraordinary increase in backlog related directly to the increase in consumer demand that we experienced in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
it also increased as a result of our existing manufacturing capacity having been planned for demand levels experienced prior to the significant increase in consumer demand 
at this time  we have limited data by which to determine how long this increase in consumer demand will last 
orders received that have not yet shipped  which constitutes our reported backlog  could be cancelled if demand were to suddenly decrease 
therefore  the backlog numbers provided may not be indicative of future sales 
sales in the consumer channel were approximately  a  or  increase over sales of  for fiscal excluding hunting products  sporting goods increased over fiscal levels 
sales to state and local government agencies were approximately  a  or  increase over fiscal sales of  international sales of approximately  represented a  or  increase over fiscal sales 
federal government sales of  were  lower than fiscal sales of  fiscal net product and services sales compared with fiscal the impact of owning thompson center arms for the full fiscal year accounted for  of the firearm sales increase 
excluding thompson center arms  firearm sales increased by  or 
total firearm unit sales for fiscal excluding thompson center arms were approximately  units  an increase of over fiscal sales of approximately  units 
firearm backlog as of april  was approximately  non firearm sales for fiscal increased as a result of the full year impact of the thompson center arms specialty services and retail operations 
the increase in revolver sales was fueled by the sale of small frame revolvers  partially offset by lower large frame revolver sales 
large frame revolvers were adversely impacted by the weak fall hunting season 
pistol sales were lower than the prior year as fiscal sales included  in pistol sales to the afghanistan military and  in pistol sales to the california highway patrol 
there were no comparable sales during fiscal the average selling price for pistols was reduced by the promotional programs implemented during the second half of fiscal fiscal m p pistol sales increased over fiscal levels 
the increase in sales of walther firearms  for which we are the exclusive us distributor  was attributable to the introduction of the pps and sp pistols as well as strong international sales of the ppk pistol 
tactical rifle sales increased significantly in their second full year of being offered 
premium products sales for fiscal decreased because of the effect of the weak hunting season on large frame performance center revolver sales and the inclusion in fiscal of the th anniversary commemorative model that was introduced in mid fiscal and drove sales significantly higher for that year 
hunting firearm sales grew significantly over fiscal primarily as a result of the full year impact of owning thompson center arms  as well as the impact of sales of icon rifles  which were introduced at the shot show 
hunting firearms also includes shipments of our fixed action and semi automatic shotguns 
parts and accessories sales increased primarily as a result of the full year impact of selling thompson center arms black powder accessories 
non firearm sales reflected the full year impact of the thompson center arms foundry operations  which are included in specialty services 
handcuff sales remained stable year over year 
sales in the consumer channel were approximately  a  or  increase over sales of  for fiscal the full year impact of thompson center arms added approximately  to fiscal consumer sales 
excluding thompson center arms sales  consumer sales grew at a rate of 
sales to state and local government agencies were approximately  a  or  decrease from fiscal sales of  fiscal state and local government sales included a  order from the california highway patrol 
excluding the impact of this large order  our state and local government sales increased  or  on continued strong performance of our m p line of firearms 
excluding the  impact of thompson center arms  international sales of approximately  represented a  or  increase over fiscal sales 
federal government sales of  were  lower than fiscal sales of  fiscal included  in product shipments to afghanistan 
no new contracts for our products for use in afghanistan were awarded during fiscal cost of revenue and gross profit the following table sets forth certain information regarding cost of revenue and gross profit for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change cost of revenue of net revenue gross profit of net revenue gross profit for fiscal increased as a result of the increase in sales while gross profit as a percentage of net revenue declined as a result of the impact of significantly lower sales and production volumes of our higher margin hunting products as well as a  accrual related to the february walther ppk and ppk s recall 
reduced production levels and a reduced number of operating days at our rochester  new hampshire plant resulted in underutilized capacity and fixed overhead not being fully absorbed into inventory 
in addition  increased capital spending over the last several years increased depreciation expense by  for fiscal promotion costs were  compared with  for the year ended april  excluding the  full year impact of owning thompson center arms  fiscal gross profit dollars decreased  while gross profit as a percentage of net revenue declined 
promotion costs of  were incurred to spur consumer demand and clear inventory from the supply chain  eroding gross margins for fiscal and substantially offsetting the increase in gross margin dollars caused by the growth in sales 
in addition  unabsorbed fixed costs associated with a three week plant shutdown in springfield  massachusetts  and a one week plant shutdown in rochester  new hampshire  negatively impacted gross profit by  operating expenses the following table sets forth certain information regarding operating expenses for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change research and development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment of long lived assets operating expenses of net revenue in october  due to serious  unfavorable  and recurring economic and market conditions and other factors that had an adverse effect on the hunting market  it became apparent that goodwill and other long lived assets related to our investment in thompson center arms were significantly impaired 
we conducted a review of the reporting unit related to these products and determined that the fair value as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas and sfas was lower than book value  requiring us to record an impairment charge of  excluding the impact of the impairment charge noted above  operating expenses for fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal levels 
the increase in research and development related to  in increased testing materials as a result of the increasing cost of ammunition   in third party engineering costs   in increased salaries and benefits  and  of reduced allocations to manufacturing based on an increased focus on new product engineering 
the increase in sales and marketing expense reflected increased sales incentives incurred as a result of the higher handgun sales levels 
the increase in general and administrative expenses included  in increased profit sharing related to our springfield  massachusetts and houlton  maine facilities 
in addition  because of weak economic factors impacting certain of our regional retail customers  we increased our bad debt reserves by  in fiscal finally  increased salaries and benefits  recruiting  and relocation resulting from changes in our management structure totaling  were offset by  in reduced amortization of intangibles as a result of the impairment charge and lower stock based compensation expense of  due to lower awards and the reversal of expense associated with performance based options that were not achieved based on actual operating results 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue  excluding the impairment charge  was for fiscal  lower than the fiscal ratio due to reduced amortization of intangibles as a result of the impairment charge as well as increased revenue caused by the increased consumer demand 
general and administrative costs for fiscal included  of amortization while fiscal included  of amortization 
operating expenses for fiscal increased primarily as a result of the full year impact of owning thompson center arms  which accounted for  of the total increase 
the remaining  increase in spending included a  increase in research and development expenses  a  increase in sales and marketing expense  and a  increase in general and administrative expenses 
the increase in research and development related to expansion of the long gun product offerings while the increase in sales and marketing expense reflected increased advertising efforts in a down market as well as increased travel by our expanded consumer sales force 
the increase in general and administrative expenses included  in higher stock based compensation expense and  in additional professional fees resulting from increased audit costs associated with the thompson center arms acquisition and the first year costs of implementing internal controls compliance under section of the sarbanes oxley act for that location as well as increased legal fees 
this was partially offset by  in reduced profit sharing expense 
stock based compensation expense for fiscal included a  adjustment to amortize restricted stock units issued in fiscal on an accelerated method rather than the straight line method in order to comply with our amortization policy for other stock based awards 
the adjustment did not have a material affect on prior periods 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was for fiscal  which was higher than the fiscal ratio due to increased amortization of intangibles associated with the thompson center arms acquisition 
general and administrative costs for fiscal included  of amortization while fiscal included  of amortization 
income loss from operations the following table sets forth certain information regarding income loss from operations for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change income loss from operations of net revenue excluding the impact of the  impairment of thompson center arms assets  fiscal operating income of  was  or  higher than operating income for fiscal the impact associated with the consumer driven demand more than offset the unfavorable absorption and product mix at thompson center arms  the impact of the walther ppk and ppk s recall  and the increase in operating expenses 
operating income for fiscal decreased  or  compared with operating income for fiscal the decrease in operating income was caused by a combination of increased promotion costs  increased unabsorbed overhead costs due to plant shutdowns  and increased operating expenses  partially offset by increased sales and the effect of owning thompson center arms for a full year in fiscal interest expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding interest expense for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change interest expense interest expense decreased for fiscal as a result of the repayment of the  acquisition line in may  the repayment of  of long term debt in june  reduced borrowings under our revolving line of credit  and overall lower interest rates 
in addition  our  share stock offering in may and the increased cash flow associated with consumer demand enabled us to reduce our overall outstanding indebtedness throughout fiscal interest expense increased for fiscal as a result of the additional debt incurred in mid fiscal to acquire thompson center arms 
in addition  higher revolving loan balances from lower operating cash flows caused interest expense to increase during fiscal income taxes the following table sets forth certain information regarding income tax expense benefit for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change income tax expense benefit our income tax benefit for fiscal included the effect of changes in temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled  after valuation allowance  at april  net deferred tax liabilities were reduced in fiscal by  as a result of the impairment of the thompson center arms goodwill and other long lived assets 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between the book value and tax bases in assets and liabilities 
in assessing the realization of our deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our net operating loss carryforwards expire 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be recovered  we establish a valuation allowance against some or all of our deferred income tax assets 
recording a valuation allowance or reversing a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
a valuation allowance of approximately  was provided on our deferred federal tax assets for a capital loss carryforward  which we do not anticipate using prior to its expiration 
no other valuation allowance was provided on our deferred federal income tax assets as of april  or  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
we had federal net operating loss carryforwards amounting to   and  as of april    and  respectively 
the net operating loss carryforward at april  expires in fiscal years and internal revenue code section limits utilization of these losses to  per year 
it is possible that future substantial changes in our ownership could occur that could result in additional ownership changes pursuant to internal revenue code section if such an ownership change were to occur  there would be an annual limitation on the remaining tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized 
federal net operating losses have increased the overall net deferred tax asset of  by  as of april  federal net operating losses account for  of the total net deferred tax liability of  as of april  there were no state net operating loss carryforwards as of the end of fiscal   or on october   the american jobs creation act  or ajca  was signed into law 
the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activity  or qpa  which will be phased in from through pursuant to the financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
 application of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activity provided by the ajca of  the effect of this deduction is reported in the period in which it is claimed on our tax return 
the qpa benefit for us was approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal and resulted in the reduction of tax expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the annual deduction for the remaining federal net operating loss carryforward is so limited by internal revenue code section that the unfavorable impact on the future benefits of the qpa should be negligible 
our income tax expense for fiscal included changes in deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled  before valuation allowance  as well as net deferred tax liabilities  which totaled  at april  net deferred tax liabilities were reduced in fiscal by  as a result of amortization of intangibles related to the thompson center arms acquisition 
net tax assets liabilities changed substantially during the year ended april  primarily as a result of the acquisition of thompson center arms in january net income loss the following table sets forth certain information regarding net income and the related per share data for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands  except per share data change change net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted the decrease in net income and net income per share for fiscal was primarily attributable to the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill associated with the acquisition of thompson center arms  which totaled  net of deferred taxes of 
excluding this write off  income would have increased  to  and earnings per share would have been 
this increase in income was a result of increased sales due to the consumer driven demand  partially offset by reduced volume and the corresponding gross margin impact in the hunting business 
in addition  eps was lower in fiscal due to an additional  shares issued during may the decrease in net income and net income per share for fiscal was primarily attributable to a weak consumer market that prompted increased promotion costs and two unscheduled plant shutdowns leading to unabsorbed overhead 
liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements are to finance the growth of our firearm and other operations  including acquisitions  and to service our existing debt 
capital expenditures for new products  capacity expansion  and process improvements represent important cash needs 
the following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change operating activities investing activities financing activities total operating activities represent the principal source of our cash flow 
cash flow from operating activities increased significantly for fiscal over fiscal levels resulting largely from a  decrease in inventory in fiscal in addition  accounts receivable decreased by  in fiscal finally  a  increase in net income excluding the non cash impairment and an increase in current accrual levels of  over the prior year increase contributed to the increase in cash from operating activities 
cash flow from operating activities decreased for fiscal from fiscal levels 
the reduction in operating cash flow for fiscal was attributable to lower net income offset by higher non cash items included in net income  such as depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes  and stock based compensation expense as well as a  increase in inventory and a  increase in accounts receivable 
the negative cash flow was partially offset by  in increased accruals over fiscal  caused primarily by accrued promotion costs for the fourth quarter promotions 
cash used for investing activities was lower in fiscal than for fiscal due to reduced capital spending of  cash used for investing activities in fiscal was significantly lower than in fiscal due to the  used to acquire thompson center arms in january capital spending was  lower in fiscal than in fiscal fiscal spending was partially offset by  in cash received from the springfield redevelopment authority as part of the final payment on acres of land sold to them in fiscal cash used by financing activities was unfavorable compared with the prior year due to the repayment of the  in acquisition loan   in term loans  and  in the revolving line partially offset by the proceeds from the may  share stock offering 
cash generated by financing activities in fiscal was lower than in fiscal due to  in debt incurred related to the acquisition of thompson center arms in january  partially offset by  in payments to acquire treasury stock in that same fiscal year 
the remaining increase in of  was due to  in increased revolving credit line borrowings to cover current cash requirements  offset by  in lower debt issue costs 
at april   we had open letters of credit aggregating at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we have a  revolving line of credit with toronto dominion texas llc with no balance outstanding as of april  in may  we completed a stock offering of  shares of common stock  which yielded net proceeds of approximately  that we expect to use for general corporate purposes  including the potential purchase of additional equipment to expand our manufacturing capacity 
in addition  on june   we reported our entry into a material definitive agreement to acquire universal security response  inc this acquisition will utilize up to a maximum of  in cash 
to the extent that opportunities present themselves  we may utilize a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to purchase a portion of our million of outstanding senior convertible notes and strategic investments 
we may also use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to pursue opportunities for strategic relationships and other acquisitions 
based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans  and expected business conditions  we believe that our existing capital resources and credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations  including our outstanding debt and other commitments  for the next months  apart from major acquisitions 
other matters inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during fiscal   or critical accounting policies use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
operating results in the future could vary from the amounts derived from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  future facts and circumstances could alter our estimates with respect to the adequacy of insurance reserves 
our significant estimates include accruals for warranty  product liability  workers compensation  environmental liability  excess and obsolete inventory  forfeiture rates on stock based awards  asset impairments  and medical claims payable 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
product sales account for a substantial portion of our revenue 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
we also provide tooling  forging  heat treating  finishing  plating  and engineering support services to customers  we recognize this revenue when accepted by the customer  when no further contingencies or material performance obligations exist  and when collectibility is reasonably assured  thereby earning us the right to receive and retain payments for services performed and billed 
we recognize trademark licensing revenue for all individual licensees on a quarterly basis based on actual receipts from licensees 
this revenue consists of minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales on licensed products 
under our current licensing agreements  this revenue is payable on a calendar quarter basis 
we recognize fees received upon initial signing of license agreements as revenue when no future obligation is required on our part 
as a result of a combination of uncertain factors regarding existing licensees  including current and past payment performance  market acceptance of the licensee s product  and insufficient historical experience  we believe that reasonable assurance of collectibility does not exist based on the results and past payment performance of licensees in general 
therefore  we do not initially recognize minimum royalty payments but instead record such revenue monthly when the minimum royalty can be reasonably estimated for that month and payment is assured 
as of april   minimum royalties to be collected in the future amounted to approximately  valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  developed technology  patents  trademarks  and tradenames 
we amortize all finite lived intangible assets either on a straight line basis or based upon patterns in which we expect to utilize the economic benefits of such assets 
with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  we initially determine the values of intangible assets by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as of the end of our fiscal third quarter and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  to assess whether impairment is present 
we have reviewed the provisions of sfas with respect to the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist 
based on our review of sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we have determined that we operate in two reporting units one for our springfield  massachusetts and houlton  maine facilities and a second for our rochester  new hampshire facility 
goodwill recorded on our books is associated only with the rochester  new hampshire reporting unit as it arose out of our acquisition of thompson center arms on january  based on a combination of factors occurring during fiscal  including the current economic environment and market conditions in the hunting industry  we determined that indicators for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets existed in our rochester  new hampshire reporting unit 
as a result  we conducted an evaluation of these assets pursuant to sfas based on lower order intake in the past several quarters and lower than expected operating profits and cash flows in this reporting unit  the earnings forecast for the next ten years was revised 
the fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
based on the work performed  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of  during the three months ended october  in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
as noted above  economic and market conditions affecting the rochester  new hampshire reporting unit required us to test for impairment of long lived assets pertaining to that location during the second quarter of fiscal based on this assessment  under sfas  we recorded an impairment charge of  to reflect the excess of the carrying value of long lived intangible assets over the discounted cash flows 
no impairment charges were taken in fiscal or based on the review of long lived assets under sfas significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our long lived assets  determining what reporting units exist  and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in our organization or our management reporting structure  as well as other events and circumstances  including technological advances  increased competition  and changing economic or market conditions  could result in a shorter estimated useful lives  b additional reporting units  which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit  and c other changes in previous assumptions or estimates 
in turn  this could have an additional impact on our consolidated financial statements through accelerated amortization and impairment charges 
goodwill and acquired intangibles we completed a significant business acquisition in fiscal  which resulted in significant goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our business strategy contemplates that we may make additional acquisitions in the future 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates  including the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenue and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives  and as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in our initial assumptions and estimates relating to prior or future acquisitions 
additionally  under sfas  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first step in our annual goodwill impairment test  based on our market value 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected or our market value declines dramatically  we may be required to complete the second step  which requires significant judgments and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined 
product liability we provide reserves for potential product liability defense costs based on estimates determined in consultation with litigation counsel 
adjustments to the provision for product liability are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are charged or credited to cost of products and services sold 
this evaluation is based upon information regarding potential or existing product liability cases 
any future costs related to this evaluation are recorded when considered both probable and reasonably estimable 
at this time  the estimated range of reasonably possible additional losses  as that term is defined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  is zero 
environmental liability we provide reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which reasonable estimates of such obligations can be made 
as of april   we had a reserve of approximately  for environmental matters  which is recorded on an undiscounted basis 
inventory we value inventories  consisting primarily of finished firearm components  finished firearms  and related products and accessories  at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
an allowance for potential non saleable inventory due to excess stock or obsolescence is based upon a detailed review of inventory components  past history  and expected future usage 
warranty we generally provide a lifetime warranty to the original purchaser of our new firearm products 
we provide for estimated warranty obligations in the period in which we recognize the related revenue 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical claims experience and the current repair costs 
we make adjustments to accruals as warranty claim data and historical experience warrant 
should we experience actual claims and repair costs that are higher than the estimated claims and repair costs used to calculate the provision  our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize would be adversely impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our domestic customers and some foreign distributors based on their financial condition 
we offer discounts for early payment 
when we believe the extension of credit is not advisable  we rely on either a prepayment or a letter of credit 
we place past due balances for collection with an outside agency after days 
we write off balances deemed uncollectible by us against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts through current past due balances  knowledge of our customers financial situations  and past payment history 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
we measure these deferred taxes by applying tax rates expected to be in place when the deferred items become subject to income tax or deductible for income tax purposes 
workers compensation we are self insured through retentions or deductibles for our workers compensation 
our liability for estimated premiums and incurred losses are actuarially determined and recorded on an undiscounted basis 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  shared based payment revised 
under sfas no 
r  we calculate compensation cost on the date of the grant using the black scholes method 
we then amortize compensation expense over the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option or purchase under our employee stock purchase program on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model using the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility  dividend yield variables  and estimated forfeiture rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar 
a portion of our gross revenue during the three and months ended april  million and million  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of aggregate gross revenue came from the sale of goods that were purchased  wholly or partially  from a european manufacturer  in euros 
annually  we purchase approximately million of inventory from a european supplier 
this exposes us to risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a drop in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro would  to the extent not covered through price adjustments  reduce our gross profit on that million of inventory by approximately million 
in an effort to offset our risks from unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations  we periodically enter into euro participating forward options under which we purchase euros to be used to pay the european manufacturer 
as of april   we had no forward contracts remaining as the last contract was exhausted in april we will continue to review the dollar euro relationship and will purchase euros at the spot rate until such time that we determine that our foreign exchange risk will be best mitigated by entering into one or more forward contracts 
participating forward options provide full protection for us against the depreciation of the us dollar to the euro and partial benefit from the appreciation of the us dollar to the euro 
if the euro strengthens above the average rate  we will not pay more than the average rate 
if the euro weakens below the average rate  of the euros are at the average rate and the remaining of the euros are paid for at the spot rate 
each option  unless used on the first day  will be converted to a forward contract  due when needed during the month at a slight up charge in rate 
during the three and months ended april   we experienced a net unfavorable opportunity cost of  and  respectively  on foreign exchange transactions that we executed during the period in an effort to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate
