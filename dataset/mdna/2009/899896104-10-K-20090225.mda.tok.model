the higher inventory balance reflected  in part  restocking by the tupperware united states business following the december fire  along with building inventories in some fast growing business units in support of that growth and in some other cases inventory levels being higher than intended due to less than expected sell through to customers 
the higher cash balance in part reflected the generation of cash in china that has not yet been repatriated  along with a higher level of cash at the corporate level related to the management of credit capacity 
the non income tax liability paid in was for value added taxes in mexico 
the offset from a higher level of accounts payable largely reflected the management of cash flow at year end and the lower current deferred tax asset reflected adjustments made to an advance payment agreement entered into by the company with one of its foreign subsidiaries 
the increase in working capital compared with reflected a million increase from stronger foreign currencies 
also contributing to the increase was a million net increase in income tax related assets and million more inventory 
notwithstanding the higher inventory amount  in light of fourth quarter sales being percent higher than fourth quarter  in local currency  days inventory on hand improved slightly versus the end of partially offsetting these items was a net of million more payables under hedge contracts and higher accruals totaling million for compensation  mainly incentives  and the timing of the value added tax payment in mexico 
on september   the company entered into an million five year senior secured credit agreement consisting of a million revolving credit facility and million in term loans 
proceeds from the credit agreement were used to repay the company s previous credit agreement dated december  credit agreement  which was obtained in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition as further discussed below 
the credit agreement was then terminated 
although the credit agreement is a floating rate debt instrument  the company is required to maintain at least percent of total outstanding debt at fixed rates  which is achieved through the use of interest rate swaps as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of terminating the credit agreement  million in deferred debt fees were written off and included in net interest expense for the year ended december  quarterly principal payments of million are due on the term loans beginning june  with any remaining principal due in september  however  the agreement permits the company to omit these payments if certain 
table of contents prepayments have been made during the previous four quarters 
the company made such optional prepayments in the fourth quarter of and totaling million and million  respectively 
the agreement also requires additional principal payments consisting of percent of cash generated from certain asset sales  certain insurance proceeds and certain new debt issuances  as well as up to percent of excess cash flows 
excess cash flows are substantively defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  required debt payments and actual dividends paid up to million annually 
however  the credit agreement provides that cash may be used to repurchase shares using proceeds from stock option exercises 
it also provides that repurchases beyond those from the use of option proceeds are excluded from certain of the financial covenant calculations if the leverage ratio as defined under the credit agreement is and will remain below times and the other covenants in the agreement are met 
the debt under the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s domestic assets  excluding real estate  and capital stock of its domestic subsidiaries plus a percent stock pledge of its significant foreign subsidiaries 
the interest rate charged on the outstanding borrowings on the credit facility is a floating libor base rate plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin ranges from percent to percent and is determined quarterly by the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december   the applicable margin was percent  resulting in an effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings of percent  for the company s libor based borrowings 
the credit agreement contains covenants customary for similarly rated companies 
the financial covenants are a fixed charge coverage ratio  a leverage ratio and an adjusted net worth requirement as defined in the agreement 
the covenant restrictions include adjusted covenant earnings and net worth measures 
the company expects to maintain compliance with its debt covenants during  however  economic conditions  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  lower than foreseen sales and profit or the occurrence of other events discussed under risk factors could cause noncompliance 
the company s most restrictive financial debt covenant is currently the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  which is required to be in excess of through the end of the third quarter of and then increases to 
the company s fixed charge ratio for the months ended december  was  yielding an adjusted covenants earnings cushion of about million 
due to the high proportion of segment profit earned by the company s international operations  the company s adjusted covenant earnings as defined in the debt agreement is significantly impacted by large changes in foreign exchange rates 
using the company s current estimates for related to the factors impacting the covenant calculation  the company estimates it will have million and million adjusted covenant earnings cushion at the end of its third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the fourth quarter estimate includes the impact of the escalation in the required fixed charge coverage ratio under the terms of the credit agreement 
the payment of future dividends or buy back of stock may be restricted or eliminated in order to improve the company s fixed charge ratio 
while the covenants are restrictive and could impact the company s ability to borrow  pay dividends or make capital investments in its business  this will not be necessary based on the company s current outlook 
the company does not expect to repurchase any of its shares in under its outstanding million authorization 
see further information in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company monitors the third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents and diversifies its cash and cash equivalents among counterparties  which minimizes exposure to any one of these entities 
furthermore  the company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates  and recent developments in the financial markets have increased the company s exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of its counterparties 
the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its working capital and capital spending needs and its current dividend 
this liquidity includes the portion of its year end cash and cash equivalents balance of million that is available in the united states  cash flows from operating activities  and access to its million secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had million available under its revolving line of credit and million available under other uncommitted lines of credit 
the company has not experienced any limitations on its ability to access its committed facility 
as previously noted  the credit agreement also has a requirement that the company keep at least percent of total borrowings at a fixed interest rate for at least three years 
in september  the company entered into four interest rate swap agreements with notional values totaling million that expire in 
table of contents under the terms of these swap agreements  the company will receive a floating rate equal to the month us dollar libor and pay a weighted average fixed rate of about percent 
the swap agreements combined with a contractual spread dictated by the credit agreement  of basis points as of december   gave the company an all in effective rate of about percent on these borrowings at that date 
in  the company entered into four forward interest rate agreements that fixed for the libor base borrowing rate for million under the credit agreement 
these agreements locked in the libor base rate for these borrowings at the forward rates then existing for the month borrowing periods beginning at the end of december and at the end of the first three quarters of the average locked in libor rate is percent 
as of december  these interest rate swaps had expired 
during  the company entered into forward interest rate agreements that swap the company s libor based floating obligation into a fixed obligation for million for and million for the company will pay a weighted average rate of about percent on the million for and percent on the million for  plus the spread under the credit agreement  which was basis points as of december  the company s credit agreement required it to maintain at least percent of its outstanding borrowings at a fixed rate for a period of at least three years in the future 
beginning in december and january  the company effectively converted million of its floating rate borrowings to fixed rate debt through interest rate swaps 
the swap agreements called for the company to receive a floating rate equal to the month us dollar libor rate and pay a weighted average fixed rate of percent 
the swap agreements combined with a contractual basis point spread gave the company an all in effective rate of percent on these borrowings 
the swap agreements were scheduled to expire in through in order to maintain compliance with the three year requirement  in  the company terminated three swaps with a total notional value of million and purchased three new swaps with the same notional value that were to expire in following this action  all of the swaps were to expire in and a gain of million was realized on the termination of these agreements and was capitalized as a component of debt 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and noted above  in september the company entered into the credit agreement  replacing the credit agreement 
as a result  these swap arrangements were terminated in september resulting in a termination payment of million 
in connection with retiring the credit agreement  the million deferred gains on the previously terminated swaps were fully recognized and both amounts were included as a component of net interest expense for the year ended december  the company s two debt ratings agencies  standard and poor s and moody s  have both rated the company 
standard and poor s currently rates the corporate credit rating of the company bb and has assigned a stable outlook 
it currently has rated the company s credit agreement as bbb 
moody s assigns a rating of ba to the corporate family rating of the company and baa to the company s credit agreement 
the company s major markets for its products are australia  china  france  germany  japan  mexico  the philippines  russia  south africa  the united states and venezula 
a significant downturn in the company s business in these markets would adversely impact the company s ability to generate operating cash flows 
operating cash flows would also be adversely impacted by significant difficulties in the recruitment  retention and activity of the company s independent sales force  the success of new products and or promotional programs 
included in the cash balance of million reported at the end of was million denominated in venezuela bolivars 
the balance is primarily a result of favorable operating cash flows in the market 
due to venezuelan government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates  the company can not immediately repatriate this cash at the exchange rate used to translate the venezuelan bolivars into us dollars for inclusion on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as of the end of  the company has applied to transfer million of such amount out of the country 
the company believes it 
table of contents could immediately repatriate the cash from venezuela  but it would only currently be able to do so at an exchange rate that would be about percent less favorable 
this would result in the company having fewer us dollars than currently reported as a component of cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet with the difference recorded as a foreign exchange loss in its consolidated statements of income 
also included in the company s cash balance at the end of was cash of million in china and million in india  which the company is currently working to efficiently make available outside of those countries 
the debt to total capital ratio at the end of was percent compared with percent at the end of debt is defined as total debt and capital is defined as total debt plus shareholders equity 
the increase in the debt to capital ratio compared to the end of was due to a decline in equity partially offset by lower total debt 
the decrease in equity reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation adjustments  cash flow hedges and dividends paid during  partially offset by earnings 
on december   the company experienced a fire at its hemingway  sc facility  causing complete destruction of its main finished goods warehouse and its contents 
the company is adequately insured to recover its inventory and building loss and direct costs associated with the fire 
as of december   the company had received million in proceeds  million of which was received in  from its insurance companies to recover the value of destroyed inventory  property  plant and equipment  and costs associated with recovering from the fire  resulting in a million pre tax gain after netting all assets lost and costs incurred related to the fire 
the company expects to receive additional proceeds in to settle remaining amounts due under the claim  however  at this time these amounts have not been included in the gain recorded as the contingency related to these amounts has not yet been resolved and the amount is not currently determinable 
the company included million of these proceeds in operating activities on its consolidated statement of cash flows as these proceeds related to destroyed inventory and certain fire related costs 
the company included million and million in proceeds in investing activities for the years ended december  and december   respectively  as they related to property  plant and equipment 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in from million in this decline reflected a million payment related to non income tax payables due in mexico as of the end of  and the payment of approximately million of such amounts on a more normal schedule in and million in payments made in to settle foreign currency hedge contracts versus a small inflow from such contracts in this was offset by an increase in net income for compared with the most significant year over year variations in changes in assets and liabilities were outflows for inventory 
this resulted from the rebuilding of the inventory level of tupperware united states following the december warehouse fire  the need for higher inventory levels in several markets to support higher sales levels and in some markets a higher level of inventory than desired in light of a lower than expected sell through of products to customers 
net cash flow from operating activities was also impacted from the proceeds from insurance recoveries 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in net income was million higher in than in among the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities  the most important net difference between years was the higher non cash impact in of re engineering and impairment costs  mainly due to the impairment of nutrimetics goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in addition to the write off and amortization of deferred loan fees and a higher provision for bad debts 
the most significant year over year variations in changes in assets and liabilities were outflows for higher inventory notwithstanding the days sales in inventory at the end of was slightly better than the end of  offset from a larger increase in in accounts payable and accruals  most notably from higher compensation accruals largely for management incentives and the timing of certain non income tax payables 

table of contents investing activities for  and  the company spent million  million and million  respectively  for capital expenditures 
the most significant type of spending in all years was for molds for new products with the greatest amount spent in europe 
in addition to cash outlays for property  plant and equipment  the company also had non cash additions through capital leases of million  million and million in  and  respectively  primarily related to the construction of a new center of excellence manufacturing facility that replaced an existing facility in belgium 
partially offsetting the capital spending were million in  million in and million in  of proceeds related to the sale of certain property  plant and equipment and insurance recoveries 
the proceeds from disposal of property  plant and equipment in were primarily from the sale of excess property for development around the company s orlando  florida headquarters land sales and automobiles in markets where the company purchases vehicles as incentive awards to some of its sales force members

in insurance proceeds were received related to property damaged by a hurricane in financing activities the company made  in net payments  to reduce borrowings of million primarily relating to a prepayment made on the term loan of million  the repayment of a mortgage note and payments on capital lease obligations 
on september  the company entered into an million five year senior secured credit agreement consisting of a million revolving credit facility and million in term loans  replacing the company s then existing credit agreement resulting in the pay down and corresponding borrowing proceeds for the net proceeds from the credit agreement were million which were used to repay borrowings under the company s credit agreement 
the refinancing completed in  together with the principal payments made on the company s term debt  resulted in total repayments of million in see detailed discussion in liquidity and capital resources including settlement of historical debt and related covenant restrictions 
dividends during  and  the company paid dividends of per share of common stock totaling million million and million  respectively 
while the payment of a dividend on common shares is a discretionary decision made on a quarterly basis  in the absence of a significant event requiring cash and assuming the ability to continue to comply with its debt covenants  the company has no current expectation of altering the dividend level as projected cash flows from operating activities are expected to be sufficient to maintain the dividend without restricting the company s ability to finance its operations  make necessary investments in the future growth of the business or its near term debt repayment obligations 
if there is an event requiring the use of cash  such as a strategic acquisition  the company would need to reevaluate whether to maintain its current dividend payout 
stock option exercises during  and  the company received proceeds of million  million and million respectively  related to the exercise of outstanding stock options 
the increase in stock option proceeds 
table of contents during was due primarily to an increase in the company s stock price and options that would have otherwise expired during this period providing incentive for option holders to exercise their outstanding options 
the decline in primarily related to the company s lower stock price in the second half of the corresponding shares were issued out of the company s balance held in treasury

under the mspp  the company loaned million to senior executives to purchase  common shares from treasury stock 
in and  an additional nine senior executives purchased  shares of common stock from treasury stock utilizing loans totaling million 
the loans had annual interest rates of percent to percent  and all dividends  while the loans were outstanding  were applied toward interest due 
each of the loans had scheduled repayment dates of percent on the fifth and sixth anniversaries of the loan issuance  with the balance due on the eighth anniversary 
there were no new participants during   or  and in line with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  no further loans will be permitted under the plan 
the mspp permits the surrender of shares in lieu of payment of the loan with the surrendered shares valued at the then current market price 
during  and  participants surrendered a total of   and  shares of the company s common stock at current market prices to satisfy loans totaling million  million and million  respectively  as part of both scheduled and voluntary repayments

as of december  the company s total gross unrecognized tax benefits were million 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of uncertain tax positions could materially change within the next months based on the results of tax examinations  expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and additions due to ongoing transactions and activity 
however  the company is unable to estimate the impact of such events 
b capital commitments mainly relate to the company s hemingway facility in south carolina 
the company has firm commitments relating to the upgrading of a previously existing warehouse that has replaced the main finished goods warehouse that was destroyed by fire in c the table excludes information on recurring purchases of inventory as these purchase orders are non binding  are generally consistent from year to year  and are short term in nature 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the implementation of the following critical accounting policies are the most significantly affected by its judgments and estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains current and long term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets 
the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
it is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects  particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long term amounts due 
this evaluation is performed market by market and account by account based upon historical experience  market penetration levels  access to alternative channels and similar factors 
it also considers collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts 
based upon the results of this analysis  for this risk the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents inventory valuation the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon estimates of future demand and selling price 
the demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs  new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels 
the company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products 
if inventory quantity exceeds projected demand  the excess inventory is written down 
however  if actual demand is less than projected by management or the estimate of selling prices of inventory on hand decreases  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment requires estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s tax planning strategies 
these estimates are made based upon the company s business plans and growth strategies in each market and are made on an ongoing basis  consequently  future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible 
any change in valuation allowance amounts is reflected in the period in which the change occurs 
at the end of  the company had net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately million against which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
of this total  approximately million relates to recurring type temporary differences which reverse regularly and are replaced by newly originated items 
the balance is primarily related to foreign tax credits and federal and state net operating losses that  other than for the amount for which a valuation allowance has been provided  are expected to be realized prior to expiration based upon future operating income generated from the united states businesses of tupperware and beauticontrol 
also  expected gains related to future land sale would result in the realization of a portion of these assets 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions are available to the company should they be necessary 
in  the company adopted the provisions of fin  which addresses whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin requires increased disclosures  provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes and the accounting in interim periods 
as a result of the adoption  a adjustment of million to increase reserves for uncertain tax positions was recognized with a corresponding decrease in the opening retained earnings balance 
as of december  and december   the company s gross unrecognized tax benefit was million and million  respectively 
the company estimates that approximately million of the unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes 
accrued interest and penalties were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
interest and penalties included in the provision for income taxes totaled million and million for the year ended december  and december   respectively 

table of contents the company is currently under tax audit for a number of periods and in a number of jurisdictions and anticipates some of the audits may conclude within the next months 
as of the end of  the company classified approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability  representing potential settlement of tax positions 
in addition  the company anticipates some additional audits may conclude within the next months 
however  the company is unable to estimate the impact of such events  if any  on its uncertain tax positions recorded as of the end of it is also reasonably possible that the amount of uncertain tax positions could materially change within the next months based on the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions as well as additions due to ongoing transactions and activity 
promotional and other accruals the company frequently makes promotional offers to its independent sales force to encourage them to meet specific goals or targets for sales levels  party attendance  recruiting or other business critical activities 
the awards offered are in the form of cash  product awards  special prizes or trips 
the cost of these awards is recorded during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award 
these accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred 
the company makes these estimates on a market by market and program by program basis 
it considers the historical success of similar programs  current market trends and perceived enthusiasm of the sales force when the program is launched 
during the promotion qualification period  actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known 
like the promotional accruals  other accruals are recorded at the time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes occur in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual 
valuation of goodwill the company s recorded goodwill relates primarily to that generated by its acquisition of beauticontrol in october  and the sara lee direct selling businesses in december the company conducts an annual impairment test of its recorded goodwill in the second and third quarter of each year related to beauticontrol and the acquired units  respectively 
additionally  in the event of a change in circumstances that leads the company to determine that a triggering event for impairment testing has occurred  a test is completed at that time 
the impairment test for goodwill involves comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure for a goodwill impairment loss 
this step revalues all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to their current fair values and then compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the valuation of goodwill is dependent upon the estimated fair market value of beauticontrol s operations both in north america and internationally  and the operations of the acquired units businesses which include six individual reporting units 
fair value of the reporting units is determined by the company using either the income approach or a combination of the income and market approach with a greater weighting on the income approach percent 
the income approach  or discounted cash flow approach  requires significant assumptions to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the significant assumptions used in the income approach include estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows including projections of revenue  costs  utilization of assets and capital requirements 
it also requires estimates as to the appropriate discount rates to be used 
the most sensitive estimate in this evaluation is the projection of operating cash flows  as these provide the basis for the fair market valuation 
the company s cash flow model uses forecasts for periods ranging from to years and a terminal value 
the significant assumptions for these forecasts include annual revenue growth rates ranging from to  with an average growth rate of about 
the growth rates are determined by reviewing historical results of these units and the historical results of other of the company s business units that are similar to those of the reporting units 
terminal values for all reporting units are calculated using a long term growth rate of 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the impairment 
table of contents tests  the company applied discount rates to its reporting units projected cash flows ranging from to percent 
discount rates at the high end of this range were for reporting units that operated in countries with higher country specific risk  such as those in south america and south africa 
the market approach relies on an analysis of publicly traded companies similar to tupperware and deriving a range of revenue and profit multiples 
the publicly traded companies used in the market approach are selected based on their having similar product lines of consumer goods or beauty products or companies using direct selling distribution methods 
the resulting multiples are then applied to the reporting unit to determine fair value 
as of september   the company completed the annual review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets of the former sara lee direct selling reporting units 
as a result of this review  nutrimetics goodwill and tradename were deemed to be impaired  resulting in a total non cash impairment charge of million 
during the second quarter of  the financial results of the nutrimetics and naturcare businesses were below expectations  and the company lowered its forecast of future sales and profit below those that were used to value these tradenames in the company s annual impairment analysis 
as a result of these factors  the company performed interim impairment tests of these tradenames and goodwill 
the results of the interim impairment tests were to record a million impairment to the nutrimetics tradename and a million impairment to the naturcare tradename in the second quarter of for the fiscal year  the company completed the review of goodwill for all reporting units and determined that there was no impairment after the write down of the tradename assets 
the company also determined that  when either the income or market approach was used  on a stand alone basis  no impairment existed 
given the sensitivity of the valuation of the reporting units to changes in estimated future cash flows versus the estimate  a reduction in the assumed future cash flows of more than percent or an increase in the discount rate of more than basis points would likely result in an impairment charge for the goodwill of the nutrimetics reporting unit 
for the beauticontrol  naturcare  avroy shlain  swissgarde and fuller reporting units  an impairment charge for goodwill would likely result if the projected cash flows decreased by more than percent or the discount rate was increased by more than basis points 
impairment charges would have an adverse impact on the company s net income and could result in a lack of compliance with the company s debt covenants  although the financial covenant directly affected is the minimum net worth requirement and the first million of any impairments arising from july  forward is excluded from the calculation of compliance with this covenant 
since july   the company has recognized cumulative impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets of million 
other intangible assets the company recorded as assets the fair value of various trademarks and tradenames acquired in conjunction with its purchase of the sara lee direct selling businesses 
these assets have indefinite lives and are evaluated for impairment annually similarly to goodwill 
the fair value of these indefinite lived intangible assets is determined using the relief from royalty method  which is a form of the income approach 
in this method  the value of the asset is calculated by selecting royalty rates  which estimate the amount a company would be willing to pay for the use of the asset 
these rates are applied to the company s projected revenue  tax affected and discounted to present value using an appropriate rate 
the royalty rates were selected by reviewing comparable trademark licensing agreements in the market and a range from to percent was used in in estimating the fair value of the tradenames  the company also applied a discount rate ranging from to percent with revenue growth similar to that used in the goodwill assessment described above 
similar to the reporting units  the discount rates towards the high end of the range related to tradenames located in areas with higher country risks such as avroy shlain and swissgarde  operating in south africa  as well as the fuller tradename that is used in mexico and south america 
as previously discussed  the company recorded a million impairment to the nutrimetics tradename and a million impairment to the naturcare trade name in the second quarter of the company determined there had been no impairment of the remaining tradenames as a result of the evaluations 
the valuation of the indefinite lived intangible assets requires the company to make significant 
table of contents estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows with these assets 
given the sensitivity of the valuation of the reporting units to changes in the estimated future cash flows versus the estimate  a reduction in the estimated future cash flows for the nutrimetics and naturcare tradenames would likely result in an additional impairment charge 
for the remaining tradenames  changes in estimated future cash flows  similar to those described above  would impact the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets and possibly result in an additional impairment 
additionally  as of december  the company had million included on its consolidated balance sheet as the value of the acquired units sales forces 
the estimated aggregate annual amortization expense associated with these intangibles for each of the five succeeding years is million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the product formulation asset recorded as part of the acquisition was fully amortized

  and r sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the measurement of the retirement obligations and costs of providing benefits under the company s pension plans involves various facts  including several assumptions 
the company believes the most critical of these assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate and government bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plans 
the discount rate assumptions used to determine pension expense for the company s us and foreign plans was as follows discount rate us plans foreign plans the company has established strategic asset allocation percentage targets for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance between risk and return 
the company periodically revises asset allocations  where appropriate  in an effort to improve return and manage risk 
the estimated rate of return is based on long term expectations given current investment objectives and historical results 
the expected rate of return assumption used by the company for its us and foreign plans was as follows expected rate of return us plans foreign plans the following table highlights the potential impact on the company s pre tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company s pension plans  based on assets and liabilities at december  in millions impact on pension expense discount rate change by basis points expected rate of return on plan assets change by basis points 
table of contents the company s actual return experience for the year ended december  was a loss of approximately percent for its us plans and percent for its foreign plans compared to the assumed return of those assets noted above 
the losses are expected to negatively impact the company s pension costs by approximately million 
in addition  declines in the value of plan assets during resulted in an increase to the plans unfunded status and a decrease to shareholders equity upon actuarial revaluation of the plans on december   and reduced benefit plan assets may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of required future funding contributions 
the contributions for the company s pension plan are expected to be approximately million compared with the contributions of million 
due to the economic conditions impacting plan assets in and therefore contributions  the company made a decision to decrease the targeted funding level for the funded us plan from percent in to percent in  however  the company s funding of the us plan is  and will be within the legal requirements 
other post retirement benefits the company accounts for its post retirement benefit plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  sfas  as amended by sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination requires the selection of various assumptions  including a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
the company determines the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plans 
high quality corporate bonds were determined to be bonds with a credit rating of aa or better by standards and poor s and aa or better by moody s 
the discount rate assumptions used by the company to determine other post retirement benefit expense was percent  percent and percent for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
a change in discount rate of basis points would not be material 
the following is the assumed health care cost trend rates used by the company health care trend rates initial health care cost trend ultimate health care cost trend number of years to ultimate trend rate the healthcare cost trend rate assumption may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects one percentage point in millions increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on post retirement benefit obligation revenue recognition revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers  the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer who  in most cases  is one of the company s independent directors or distributors or a member of its independent sales force and when collection is reasonably assured 
when revenue is recorded  estimates of returns are made and recorded as a reduction of revenue 
discounts earned based on promotional programs in place  volume of purchases or other factors are also estimated at the time of revenue recognition and recorded as a reduction of that revenue 
stock based compensation the company measures compensation cost for stock based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes 
table of contents option pricing model  which requires the input of assumptions  including the estimated length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term 
furthermore  in calculating compensation for these awards  the company is also required to approximate the number of options that will be forfeited prior to completing their vesting requirement forfeitures 
many factors are considered when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
impact of inflation inflation as measured by consumer price indices has continued at a low level in most of the countries in which the company operates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk one of the company s market risks is its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes 
the company has elected to manage this risk through the maturity structure of its borrowings  interest rate swaps  and the currencies in which it borrows 
the company has previously set a target  over time  of having approximately half of its borrowings with fixed rates based either on the stated terms or through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
as discussed earlier  the company s borrowings under its current credit agreement carry a variable interest rate  but the agreement requires the company to maintain a fixed interest rate on at least percent of total debt during the term of the loan  which is consistent with the terms of the company s previous credit agreement 
in september  the company entered into four interest rate swap agreements with notional values totaling million that expire in under the terms of these swap agreements  the company will receive a floating rate equal to the month us dollar libor and pay a weighted average fixed rate of about percent 
the swap agreements combined with a contractual spread dictated by the credit agreement  and basis points as of december   gave the company an all in effective rate of about percent on these borrowings as of the end of during  the company entered into forward interest rate agreements that swap the company s libor based floating obligation into a fixed obligation for million for and million for the company will pay a weighted average rate of about percent on the million for and percent on the million for  plus the spread under the credit agreement  which was basis points as of december  the above interest rate swaps entered into in and  effectively fixed the interest rates on million of the company s debt for and million in  decreasing the company s exposure from the impact of interest rate changes 
if short term interest rates varied in by percent with all other variables remaining constant  the company s annual interest expense would not be significantly impacted 
a significant portion of the company s sales and profit comes from its international operations 
although these operations are geographically dispersed  which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries  the company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations 
these risks include local political and economic environments  and relations between foreign and us governments 
another economic risk of the company is exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of the company s international operations 
the company is not able to project in 
table of contents any meaningful way the possible effect of these fluctuations on translated amounts or future earnings 
this is due to the company s constantly changing exposure to various currencies  the fact that all foreign currencies do not react in the same manner in relation to the us dollar and the large number of currencies involved  although the company s most significant exposures are to the euro and mexican peso 
although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the company s local product sourcing in many markets  a strengthening us dollar generally has a negative impact on the company 
in response to this fact  the company uses financial instruments  such as forward contracts  to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks associated with a portion of its investment in international operations 
in addition to hedging against the balance sheet impact of changes in exchange rates  the hedge of investments in international operations also has the effect of hedging a portion of cash flows from those operations 
the company also hedges with these instruments certain other exposures to various currencies arising from amounts payable and receivable  non permanent intercompany loans and forecasted purchases 
while the company s hedges of its equity in its foreign subsidiaries and its fair value hedges of balance sheet risks all work together to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses  they result in an impact to operating cash flows as they are settled 
for the year ended december   the cash flow impact of these currency hedges was an outflow of million 
the us dollar equivalent of the company s most significant net open hedge positions as of december  were to sell euro million  japanese yen million  swiss francs million  mexican pesos million  and russian rubles million  and to buy new zealand dollars million  and indonesian rupiah million 
in agreements to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  for example  an appreciating dollar versus the opposing currency would generate a cash inflow for the company at settlement with the opposite result in agreements to buy foreign currencies for us dollars 
the above noted notional amounts change based upon changes in the company s outstanding currency exposures 
based on rates existing as of december   the company was in a net payable position of approximately million related to its currency hedges  which upon settlement could have a significant impact on the company s cash flow 
the company records the impact of forward points in net interest expense 
a precise calculation of the impact of currency fluctuations is not practical since some of the contracts are between non us dollar currencies 
the company continuously monitors its foreign currency exposure and may enter into additional contracts to hedge exposure in the future 
see further discussion regarding the company s hedging activities for foreign currency in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations 
the risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance have been considered in the determination of fair value for the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps 
the company continues to closely monitor its counterparties and will take action  as appropriate and possible  to further manage its counterparty credit risk 
the company is also exposed to rising material prices in its manufacturing operations and in particular the cost of oil and natural gas based resins 
this is the primary material used in production of most tupperware products and the company currently estimates that it will utilize just over million of resins in its production of tupperware products during the company uses many different kinds of resins in its products 
about two thirds of its resins are polyolefins simple chemical structure  easily refined from oil  and as such the price of these is strongly affected by the underlying price of oil 
the remaining one third of its resins are more highly engineered  where the price of oil plays a less direct role in determining price 
with a comparable product mix  a percent fluctuation in the cost of resin would impact the company s annual cost of sales by about million compared with the prior year 
for  the company s estimates its cost of sales of the tupperware products it produced was adversely impacted by about million due to resin cost changes as compared with the company partially manages this risk by utilizing a centralized procurement function that is able to 
table of contents take advantage of bulk discounts while maintaining multiple suppliers and also enters into short term pricing arrangements 
it also manages its margin through the pricing of its products  with price increases generally in line with consumer inflation in each market  and its mix of sales through its promotional programs and discount offers 
it may also  on occasion  make advance material purchases to take advantage of current favorable pricing 
at this point in time  the company has determined that entering forward contracts for resin prices is not cost beneficial and has no such contracts in place 
however  should circumstances warrant  the company may consider such contracts in the future 
the company s program to sell land held for development is also exposed to the risks inherent in the real estate development process 
included among these risks are the ability to obtain all government approvals  the success of buyers in attracting tenants for commercial or residential developments in the orlando real estate market or obtaining financing and general economic conditions  such as interest rate increases 
the company s land sale program was negatively impacted in and by the credit crisis in the united states which is expected to delay the completion of the program
