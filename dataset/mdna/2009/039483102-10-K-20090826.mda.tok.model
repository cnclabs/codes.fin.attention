item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at june   the company estimates it will spend approximately billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above 
the company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets 
at june   the company s carrying value of these limited partnership investments was million 
the company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments  if called for  to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships 
the company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of million at june in addition  the company has entered into agreements  primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees  which could obligate the company to make future payments 
the company s liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation 
the company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations 
at june   these contingent obligations totaled approximately million 
amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were million at june  critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical  as these policies are important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management 
management has discussed with the company s audit committee the development  selection  disclosure  and application of these critical accounting policies 
following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the company s financial statements 
inventories and derivatives certain of the company s merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories  forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values 
these merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded  have quoted market prices  and may be sold without significant additional processing 
management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold 
if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value  amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially 
the company  from time to time  uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month  to fix the purchase price of the company s anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities  and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol 
the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been  and is expected to continue to be  highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item 
gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income  net of applicable income taxes  and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 
if it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item  then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued employee benefit plans the company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits 
eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to january  participate in a defined benefit pension plan 
eligible domestic employees hired on or after january  and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to january  participate in a cash balance pension formula 
the company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care  at full cost to the retiree certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage 
in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans  management makes several estimates and assumptions  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  and anticipated future health care costs 
these estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience combined with management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans 
if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly  and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
income taxes the company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the company 
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns  and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the company s income statement 
realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the company s tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable 
based on management s evaluation of the company s tax position  it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued 
to the extent the company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted 
undistributed earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested  and accordingly  no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon 
if the company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested  the company could be subject to us tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued asset abandonments and write downs the company is principally engaged in the business of procuring  transporting  storing  processing  and merchandising agricultural commodities and products 
this business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive 
both the availability of the company s raw materials and the demand for the company s finished products are driven by factors such as weather  plantings  government programs and policies  changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
these aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply demand dynamics for the company s raw materials and finished products 
any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the company s assets in terms of geographic location  size  and age of its factories 
the company  from time to time  will also invest in equipment  technology  and companies related to new  value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products 
these new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective 
management evaluates the company s property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually 
assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets  then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
valuation of marketable securities and investments in affiliates the company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value 
the company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence 
these investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted  where appropriate  for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee 
for publicly traded securities  the fair value of the company s investments is readily available based on quoted market prices 
for non publicly traded securities  management s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds 
in the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value  management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
in evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment  management considers the market conditions  trends of earnings  discounted cash flows  trading volumes  and other key measures of the investment as well as the company s ability and intent to hold the investment 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s marketable securities and investments in affiliates 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities  then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity market prices as they relate to the company s net commodity position  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates as described below 
commodities the availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather  plantings  government programs and policies  changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  the company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts 
the company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins 
the results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities  counterparty contracts defaults  and volatility of freight markets 
in addition  the company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed  or sold  in a future month 
the changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item 
gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes  and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories  related purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts  including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements 
the fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
actual results may differ 
long short fair value market risk fair value market risk in millions highest position lowest position average position the change in fair value of the average position for compared to was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position 
currencies the company conducts its business in many countries 
for the majority of the company s subsidiaries located outside the united states  the local currency is the functional currency 
in order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  except for amounts permanently invested as described below  the company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities  primarily the euro  british pound  and canadian dollar 
the instruments used are forward contracts  swaps with banks  exchange traded futures contracts  and over the counter options 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions 
the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued the amount the company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is billion at june   and billion at june  this decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the us dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is million and million for and  respectively 
actual results may differ 
interest the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices  where available  and discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value 
market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 
decrease in interest rates 
actual results may differ 
in millions fair value of long term debt excess of fair value over carrying value market risk the increase in fair value of long term debt in resulted principally from decreased interest rates
