cleco power s rate case the lpsc directed cleco power to file a full base rate case at least months prior to the expected in service date of rodemacher unit on july   cleco power filed a request for a new rate plan with the lpsc to increase its base rates for electricity 
cleco power is seeking recovery of revenues sufficient to cover the addition of rodemacher unit to its existing expense and rate base levels 
although base revenues will increase under cleco power s proposed rate plan  fuel costs and collection of financing charges are expected to decrease 
seven industrial customers have filed interventions in the rate case  which is currently in the discovery phase 
at this time  cleco power anticipates a settlement of the rate case in the second quarter of the new rates are expected to be effective upon the commercial operation date of rodemacher unit franchises cleco power operates under nonexclusive franchise rights granted by governmental units  such as municipalities and parishes counties  and enforced by state regulation 
these franchises are for fixed terms  which may vary from years to years or more 
in the past  cleco power has been substantially successful in the timely renewal of franchises as each reached the end of its term 
cleco power s next municipal franchise expires in renewed franchises cleco power renewed the following franchise agreements during no franchises were renewed in date city term number of customers may mamou years may ville platte years may dequincy years september glenmora years november kinder years other franchise matters on february   the city council of eunice voted to accept a city wide franchise proposal with south louisiana electric membership cooperative slemco a local electric cooperative 
the cooperative will now have the opportunity to serve customers city wide 
however  both utilities are required to follow the lpsc foot rule regulation to determine which utility can provide electricity to the customer 
in general  if a utility s distribution system is within feet of the new customer s meter point  that utility automatically serves the customer 
otherwise  the customer may choose the electricity provider 
the lpsc is currently reviewing its foot rule docket no 
r 
management is unable to predict the time of completion of this review 
this decision is not expected to have a material impact on cleco power s results of operations or financial condition  but may reduce future customer and load growth as both utilities compete for new customers 
in june  slemco entered into a limited franchise agreement with the city of crowley 
cleco power also provides electric service to crowley under an existing franchise agreement 
the new agreement allows slemco to compete for new customers in areas of the city that have been annexed by crowley since this decision does not have a material impact on cleco power s results of operations or financial condition  but could reduce customer and load growth as both utilities compete for new customers 
cleco power has not experienced any reduction in customers or load growth since the signing of the limited franchise by slemco 
historically  cleco power has been allowed to recover municipal franchise fees as part of the base rates it charges retail customers 
consequently  franchise fees are recovered from customers both inside and outside a franchised area 
in october  the lpsc ordered the billing of franchise fees as a separate line item on customer bills 
the decision provided that of the franchise fee would continue to be included in base rates charged to retail customers and of the franchise fee would be included on customer bills as a separate line item  billed only to customers within the franchised area 
this decision is not expected to have a material impact on cleco power s results of operations or financial condition 
on may   the town of elizabeth entered into a lease franchise agreement with cleco power under which its electrical system will be leased to cleco power 
the agreement is for years with two year renewal terms

legislative and regulatory changes and matters various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are considering a number of issues that could shape the future of the electric utility industry 
such issues include  among others passage of the energy independence and security act of  regulation of previously deregulated retail electric markets  the ability of electric utilities to recover stranded costs  the role of electric utilities  independent power producers and competitive bidding in the purchase  construction and operation of new generating capacity  the pricing of transmission service on an electric utility s transmission system  ferc s assessment of market power and utilities ability to buy generation assets  mandatory transmission reliability standards  the authority of ferc to grant utilities the power of eminent domain  increasing requirements for renewable energy sources  comprehensive multi emissions environmental legislation  regulation of greenhouse gas emissions  ferc s increased ability to impose financial penalties  and the american recovery and reinvestment act of the registrants are unable  at this time  to predict the outcome of such issues or effects on their financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

environmental matters environmental quality cleco is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment 
violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines and penalties 
cleco has obtained the environmental permits necessary for its operations  and management believes cleco is in compliance in all material respects with these permits  as well as all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
environmental requirements continue to increase as a result of new legislation  administrative actions  and judicial interpretations 
therefore  the future effects of existing and potential requirements are difficult to determine 
cleco power may request recovery from its retail customers of its costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
if revenue relief were to be approved by the lpsc  then cleco power s retail rates could increase 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs  such a decision could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco s capital expenditures related to environmental compliance were million during and are estimated to total million in the following table lists capital expenditures for environmental matters by subsidiary 
subsidiary thousands environmental capital expenditures for projected environmental capital expenditures for cleco power evangeline acadia total represents aph s portion of acadia the decrease in projected environmental capital expenditures at cleco power from to primarily relates to the installation of new low nox burners at the rodemacher unit power station during the increase in projected capital expenditures at evangeline from to primarily relates to the installation of a system to remove aquatic vegetation in the lake which cools the circulating water from the generating units at the plant 
the installation of this system is expected to be completed during air quality the state of louisiana regulates air emissions from each of cleco s generating units through the air quality regulations of the ldeq 
in addition  the ldeq has been delegated authority over and implements certain programs established by the epa 
the ldeq establishes standards of performance and requires permits for certain generating units in louisiana 
all of cleco s generating units are subject to these requirements 
cleco corporation cleco power form k the federal caa established a regulatory program to address the effects of acid rain and imposed restrictions on so emissions from certain generating units 
the federal caa requires these generating stations to possess a regulatory allowance for each ton of so emitted beginning in the year the epa allocates a set number of allowances to each affected unit based on its historic emissions 
as of december   cleco power and midstream had sufficient allowances for operations and expect to have sufficient allowances for operations under the acid rain program 
the federal caa required the epa to revise nox emission limits for existing coal fired boilers 
in november  the epa finalized rules lowering the nox emission rate for certain boilers  which apply to rodemacher unit and dolet hills 
the rules also allowed an early elect option to achieve compliance with a less restrictive nox limit beginning no later than january  cleco power exercised this option in december early election protected cleco power from any further reductions in the nox permitted emission rate until when the limit was lowered by 
rodemacher unit and dolet hills have been in compliance with the nox early election limits since their inception and also were in compliance with the reduced limit in cleco power s phase i low nox burner project was permitted by the ldeq and installed in to achieve compliance with the reduced acid rain permit limits for nox at dolet hills 
rodemacher unit has achieved compliance with these reduced acid rain nox limits in its current configuration 
with its low nox burner project completed  rodemacher unit is able to achieve compliance by an even greater margin 
the additional nox reductions achieved by the low nox burner projects may qualify for early reduction credits under the federal clean air interstate rule cair  which was recently reinstated as discussed below 
significant future reductions in nox emissions limits may require other capital improvements at one or both of the units 
nox emissions from the evangeline and acadia generating units are within the units respective permitted limits  as these units use modern turbine and selective catalytic reduction technology that reduces nox emissions to low levels 
on march   cair was finalized by the epa 
cair covered the district of columbia and eastern states  including louisiana  and provides a federal framework requiring states to reduce emissions of so and nox 
cair called for nox reductions to begin in the year and so reductions in louisiana promulgated state regulations to incorporate these requirements 
the ldeq chose to remain under the federal implementation plan fip for compliance with cair so provisions 
it also proposed to follow the fip for the annual nox and ozone season nox trading programs with the exception of the nox allowance allocation methodology 
this rule has been heavily litigated by multiple parties in the case known as north carolina vs 
epa 
on july   the us court of appeals for the us circuit vacated cair 
on september   the epa  industry groups and environmental groups filed petitions with the dc circuit court  requesting a rehearing of north carolina vs 
epa 
on december   the us court of appeals for the us circuit ruled on these petitions filed by the epa and industry intervenors 
the court granted the epa s petition to the extent that the case be remanded without vacature for the agency to conduct further proceedings consistent with the court s opinion in the case  and denied the remaining petitions 
the court determined that  notwithstanding the flaws of cair  remanding it without vacature was preferable in that it preserved the environmental benefits of the rule 
as a result  cair went into effect in its entirety on january  and will remain in effect until the epa re writes the rule to address the flaws identified by the court in the initial cair rule 
the epa does not have a specified timeframe to complete the new rule  however  cleco expects it to take from one to two years to complete 
at this time  cleco cannot determine what the new rule requirements will entail 
cleco had previously evaluated potential compliance strategies to meet the emission reductions contemplated by the cair regulations 
the installation of new low nox burners and enhancements to the so scrubber at dolet hills were expected to be an integral part of meeting the cair nox and so reduction provisions 
likewise  the installation of the new low nox burners at rodemacher unit in will help meet cair nox reduction requirements 
cleco will rely on its previous compliance strategy to meet the cair requirements and also may include additional emission controls  purchase of allowances  or fuel changes to enhance its compliance 
on march   the epa issued final rules regarding mercury emissions from electric utility boilers 
the federal clean air mercury rule camr established standards of performance limiting mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants and created a market based cap and trade program 
camr emissions reductions were to take effect in january louisiana adopted the epa s federal camr regulations by reference and incorporated these requirements in louisiana s state regulations 
cleco owns units that would have been subject to camr  namely dolet hills and rodemacher unit however  on february   the us court of appeals for the us circuit in new jersey v 
epa  vacated both the epa s rule delisting coal and oil fired electric generating units egus from regulation under section of the caa and the entire camr rule 
as a result of the court s action  egus are subject to regulation under section  which will require the epa to promulgate maximum achievable control technology mact standards for hazardous air pollutants for coal and oil fired egus 
similar to the cair rule  the epa and other petitioners asked the us court of appeals for the dc circuit to rehear the case of new jersey vs 
epa 
on may   the dc circuit court denied the epa s and industry intervenors petitions for rehearing 
on october   the epa petitioned the supreme court for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the dc circuit court of appeals in the new jersey case 
among the reasons cited for filing the petition are that the court of appeals decision effectively divests the epa of the discretion that congress conferred on the agency to consider alternative regulatory approaches to combating air pollution from power plants and prevents the epa from cleco corporation cleco power form k reconsidering a listing decision that  under the plain terms of the act  is not yet a final agency action subject to judicial review 
in september  industry intervenors also petitioned the supreme court to review the case 
on february   the epa moved to dismiss their motion for supreme court review of the new jersey vs 
epa case 
on february   the supreme court denied the industry petitioners request for a review of the lower court s decision of the case 
as such  camr is vacated 
the epa will have to move forward to set mact standards for coal and oil fired egus under section of the caa which requires that new sources must adopt at minimum the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source  as determined by the administrator and existing sources must adopt emission controls equal to the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing percent of the existing source 
at this time  cleco anticipates that the epa would take approximately two years to gather new data and promulgate an updated mact standard for egus and another three years for the regulations to become effective 
on january   the epa issued guidance directing state permitting authorities to make case by case mact determinations  consistent with the requirements of section g of the caa  for coal and oil fired egus that began actual construction or reconstruction between march  and march  the epa issued the guidance in response to the new jersey decision which left unresolved the question of whether egus that began actual construction or reconstruction between march and march were subject to case by case mact pursuant to section g 
rodemacher unit is a unit that began construction between the dates in question  and was permitted as a minor source within the context of what constitutes hazardous air pollutants under section g rules 
cleco does not currently believe that case by case mact applies to rodemacher unit the ldeq is ultimately responsible for making a determination regarding the applicability of case by case mact to rodemacher unit should case by case mact apply to rodemacher unit  there could be impacts on the final capital cost of the unit and or delays in the construction schedule 
cleco is not able to quantify the potential impact to capital investment  operating costs or construction delay associated with the application of case by case mact standards to rodemacher unit at this time 
congress may consider bills related to climate change during upcoming sessions  such as bills related to mandatory cuts in co and other greenhouse gas ghg emissions  renewable portfolio standards  and energy efficiency 
all of these types of climate change proposals may potentially affect the electric generating industry 
on april   the supreme court ruled in massachusetts v 
epa that co and three other ghgs are air pollutants under the federal caa 
as air pollutants  the supreme court s decision would require the epa to regulate ghg emissions from new motor vehicles if  in the epa s judgment  such ghg emissions may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare 
based on the supreme court s decision that ghgs are air pollutants  the epa could decide to use its authority under the caa to regulate ghgs  including co  from motor vehicles and stationary sources such as power plants 
thus  the supreme court ruling could possibly lead to the federal regulation of co and other ghg emissions in the upcoming years independent of any climate change bill being considered by congress 
on july   the epa released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr discussing the epa s efforts with respect to the endangerment determination concerning motor vehicle ghg emissions in light of the supreme court s massachusetts v 
epa decision 
the anpr also considered how ghg emissions from stationary sources might be regulated under various provisions of the caa and the potential impacts and effects of doing so 
the new presidential administration has indicated that addressing climate change is a high priority and may consider regulating ghgs under the caa 
cleco will continue to monitor the development of new legislative and regulatory initiatives and requirements relating to climate change and the potential impacts of such developments 
at this time  cleco cannot predict the outcome of the anpr process  whether the new administration will regulate ghgs under the caa  any resulting changes to federal regulations  or the impact on cleco s operations from any climate change initiatives 
the enactment of federal or state renewable portfolio standards rps mandating the use of renewable and alternative fuel sources  such as wind  solar  biomass and geothermal  could result in certain changes in cleco s business or its competitive position 
these changes could include costs for renewable energy credits and capital expenditures for renewable generation resources 
rps legislation has been enacted in many states and the new presidential administration may pursue legislation to create a national rps 
states such as louisiana that do not have rps requirements could adopt such requirements in the future or be subject to federal rps requirements 
cleco is evaluating the impacts of potential rps legislation on its businesses based on the rps programs in other states 
cleco will continue to monitor developments related to rps at the federal and state levels 
on march   the epa set new national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone  the new primary hour ozone standard is set at parts per million ppm and the new secondary standard at a form and level identical to the primary standard 
the previous primary and secondary standards were each effectively set at ppm 
the previous standard was set in and louisiana had five parishes in the baton rouge area that had not yet attained compliance with the standards 
the ldeq estimates that additional parishes could be in violation of the new standard  including desoto parish  the location of cleco s dolet hills power station 
cleco cannot determine at this time whether desoto parish will ultimately be listed as non attainment because much work must be done by the ldeq to make those non attainment designations 
the state must make the initial designations by june  final designations by and by promulgate regulations on how louisiana will cleco corporation cleco power form k comply 
since nox emissions are a precursor to ozone formation  existing fossil fuel fired units located in or near these newly designated ozone non attainment areas that do not currently utilize best available control technology could be targeted for installation of additional nox emission controls 
in february  cleco power received notices from the epa requesting information relating to the rodemacher and dolet hills power stations 
the apparent purpose of the investigation is to determine whether cleco power has complied with new source review and new source performance standards requirements under the caa in connection with capital expenditures  modifications  or operational changes made at these facilities 
cleco power has completed its response to the initial data request 
it is unknown at this time whether the epa will take further action as a result of the information provided by cleco power 
on march   cleco power received a consolidated compliance order and notice of potential penalty co nopp from the ldeq for alleged violations of the air quality rules at its dolet hills and rodemacher power stations 
for dolet hills  the co nopp alleges that upon a file review conducted on or about february   the ldeq found that cleco power was in violation of conditions in its title v permit regarding compliance assurance tests to be conducted upon its continuous monitoring systems 
upon review of the ldeq findings and the part regulations  cleco power contends that the actions taken were allowed under the part regulations  as well as the title v permit 
in regard to the rodemacher power station violations  the co nopp states that a file review of the rodemacher facility was conducted on or about september   and that upon the agency s review of the quarterly stack emissions reports required under cfr part submitted by cleco power  the ldeq found that rodemacher unit exceeded opacity limits at various times during the second  third and fourth quarters of on may   cleco power and the ldeq entered into a dispute resolution agreement to give the parties additional time to discuss resolution of this co nopp 
on august   cleco offered to resolve the matter in a settlement agreement 
on december   the parties extended the dispute resolution agreement to march  cleco continues to negotiate a settlement with the ldeq and anticipates reaching a final agreement by the new deadline 
cleco is unable to determine what the final settlement with the ldeq will entail 
water quality cleco has received from the epa and the ldeq permits required under the federal clean water act for waste water discharges from its five generating stations 
waste water discharge permits have fixed dates of expiration  and cleco applies for renewal of these permits within the applicable time periods 
the ldeq issued a louisiana pollutant discharge elimination system lpdes waste water permit renewal for evangeline power station on june  this waste water permit contains certain additional copper and total dissolved solids tds permit limitations that cleco contends are beyond the legal authority of ldeq to include in the waste water permit 
cleco challenged these permit provisions by filing a de novo review judicial appeal on september   in district court in east baton rouge parish  louisiana 
while litigation has been filed  cleco actively is engaged with the ldeq in settlement discussions regarding the appealed provisions of the waste water permit 
in december  cleco filed an application with the ldeq modifying its lpdes permit to incorporate new copper and tds discharge limitations that were agreed to by both parties 
cleco expects to receive the modified water permit with new copper and tds limits in the third or fourth quarter of  provided no adverse public comments are received 
until the final permit is received  the filed litigation is still pending and the appealed copper and tds permit limitations are stayed 
the uncontested portions of the evangeline waste water permit were effective january  section b of the clean water act regulates potential adverse environmental impacts to all aquatic species due to water intake structures 
these regulations establish requirements applicable to the location  design  construction  and capacity of cooling water intake structures 
section b is applicable to cleco s teche power station and evangeline power station 
on july   the epa officially suspended the phase ii  b rule as a result of a january decision by the us court of appeals for the second circuit which largely overturned the epa s final phase ii b rule 
the appeals court decision limits or rejects the use of cost effectiveness and cost benefit tests historically recognized by other federal courts 
due to the suspension of the rule  mandatory compliance dates for the completion of studies and assessments will likely be delayed for some time until the epa can re write a new rule for phase ii facilities which addresses the court s concerns 
until the epa promulgates a replacement phase ii rule  the epa has indicated that it will ask permit writers to use best professional judgment in evaluating permit renewals until a new b rule is promulgated 
in april  the us supreme court agreed to hear an appeal of the case with regard to a single issue whether section b of the clean water act  usc b  authorizes the epa to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake structures 
unless the second circuit s decision is overturned by the supreme court  the epa and the ldeq could mandate that the next generation of permit renewals  which for applicable cleco facilities will occur in the timeframe  include a more expensive  technology based approach ie  modifications to existing intake structures or conversion to cooling tower systems 
at this time  it is uncertain which technology option  if any  will be required to be installed on cleco s intake structures and the associated costs of those modifications 
cleco anticipates that any new requirements for its affected facilities would be established as the facilities go through the water discharge permit renewal process 
cleco corporation cleco power form k solid waste disposal the solid waste division of the ldeq has adopted a permitting system for the management and disposal of solid waste generated by power stations 
cleco has received all required permits from the ldeq for the on site disposal of solid waste from its generating stations 
cleco has renewed the solid waste permits for the existing rodemacher and dolet hills solid waste units and is in the process of upgrading them according to the current solid waste regulations and permit requirements 
these upgrades are not expected to result in substantial costs 
hazardous waste generation cleco produces certain wastes that are classified as hazardous at its five generating stations and at other locations 
cleco does not treat  store long term  or dispose of these wastes on site  therefore  no permits are required 
all hazardous wastes produced by cleco are disposed of at federally permitted hazardous waste disposal sites 
toxic substances control act tsca the tsca directs the epa to regulate the marketing  disposal  manufacturing  processing  distribution in commerce  and use of pcbs 
cleco may continue to operate equipment containing pcbs under the tsca 
once the equipment reaches the end of its usefulness  the epa regulates handling and disposal of the equipment and fluids containing pcbs 
within these regulations  the handling and disposal is allowed only through epa approved and permitted facilities 
the epa revised tsca regulations to require utilities to report data on the manufacture or import of organic compounds every five years 
cleco submitted this information in december for its applicable facilities 
toxics release inventory tri the tri requires an annual report from industrial facilities on about substances that they release into air  water  and land 
the tri ranks companies based on how much of a particular substance they release on a state and parish county level 
annual reports are due to the epa on july following the reporting year end 
cleco has submitted required tri reports on its activities  and the tri rankings are available to the public 
the rankings do not result in any federal or state penalties 
electric and magnetic fields emfs the possibility that exposure to emfs emanating from electric power lines  household appliances  and other electric devices may result in adverse health effects or damage to the environment has been a subject of some public attention 
cleco power funds scientific research on emfs through various organizations 
to date  there are no definitive results  but research is continuing 
lawsuits alleging that the presence of electric power transmission and distribution lines has an adverse effect on health and or property values have arisen in several states 
cleco power is not a party in any lawsuits related to emfs 
other on october   cleco received a special notice for remedial investigation and feasibility study from the epa 
the special notice requested that cleco corporation and cleco power  along with many other listed prps  enter into negotiations with the epa for the performance of a remedial investigation and feasibility study at an area known as the devil s swamp lake just northwest of baton rouge  louisiana 
the epa has identified cleco as one of many companies sending pcb wastes for disposal to the site 
the devil s swamp lake site has been proposed to be added to the national priorities list npl based on the release of pcbs to fisheries and wetlands located on the site 
the epa has yet to make a final determination on whether to add devil s swamp lake to the npl 
the epa and a number of prps met on january   for an organizational meeting to discuss the background of the site 
the prps began discussing a potential proposal to the epa on february  negotiations among the prps and the epa are ongoing in regard to the remedial investigation and feasibility study at the devil s swamp site  with little progress having been made since the january meeting 
the prps alleged to have disposed pcbs at the site have proposed a tentative cost sharing formula with the facility owner to fund the remedial investigation 
the response to the proposal has been pending for months 
since this investigation is in the preliminary stages  management is unable to determine whether the costs associated with possible remediation of the facility site will have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco corporation cleco power form k item a 
risk factors the following risk factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the registrants 
cleco power s rates and rate case the lpsc and ferc regulate the rates that cleco power can charge its customers 
on july   cleco power filed a new rate plan for its retail rates that is expected to go into effect when rodemacher unit begins commercial operations 
the lpsc could disallow the recovery of material costs or an adequate return on capital 
cleco power s ongoing financial viability depends on its ability to recover its costs from its lpsc jurisdicational customers in a timely manner through its lpsc approved rates and its ability to pass through to its ferc customers in rates its ferc authorized revenue requirements 
cleco power s financial viability also depends on its ability to recover in rates an adequate return on capital  including long term debt and equity 
if cleco power is unable to recover any material amount of its costs in rates in a timely manner or recover an adequate return on capital  its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
cleco power s revenues and earnings are substantially affected by regulatory proceedings known as rate cases 
during those cases  the lpsc determines cleco power s rate base  depreciation rates  operation and maintenance costs  and administrative and general costs that cleco power may recover from its retail customers through its rates 
these proceedings may examine  among other things  the prudence of cleco power s operation and maintenance practices  level of subject expenditures  allowed rates of return  and previously incurred capital expenditures 
the lpsc has the authority to disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred 
these regulatory proceedings typically involve multiple parties  including governmental bodies and officials  consumer advocacy groups  and various consumers of energy  who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or reducing rates 
rate cases generally have long timelines  which may be limited by statute 
decisions are typically subject to appeal  potentially leading to additional uncertainty 
cleco power s current base rates have been extended through the start of rodemacher unit on july   cleco power filed a rate plan to establish new rates to be effective upon commercial operation of the rodemacher unit as part of the new rate plan  cleco power has requested a return on equity of 
cleco power s current base rates allow it the opportunity to earn a maximum regulated return on equity of  which is based on a return on equity of  with any regulated earnings between and shared between shareholders and customers in a ratio 
seven industrial customers have filed interventions in the rate case  which is currently in the discovery phase 
at this time  cleco power anticipates a settlement of the rate case in the second quarter of  with new rates effective upon commercial operation of rodemacher unit cleco power is currently recording afudc associated with construction of rodemacher unit once the plant begins commercial operations  cleco power will no longer record afudc related to rodemacher unit recovery of the rodemacher unit investment is the largest component in cleco power s general rate plan that was filed with the lpsc 
if the lpsc does not increase cleco power s base rates or denies cleco power s request to recover material costs  including those incurred in the construction of rodemacher unit  cleco power s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

storm restoration costs the recovery of costs resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike is subject to lpsc review and approval  and recovery of some of the costs could be disallowed 
restoration costs incurred by cleco power from damage caused by hurricanes gustav and ike during the third quarter of are subject to a prudency review by the lpsc in which cleco power will be required to demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred 
accordingly  cleco power may not be able to recover some of the storm costs incurred  which could be material 
the costs will be reviewed by the lpsc as part of cleco s pending rate case 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover substantial restoration costs incurred  such a decision could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
rodemacher unit construction costs the recovery of costs incurred to construct rodemacher unit is subject to lpsc review and approval  and some of the costs could be disallowed 
costs incurred in the construction of rodemacher unit are subject to a prudency review by the lpsc 
cleco power filed a new rate plan with the lpsc on july   seeking to recover the construction costs through its base rates 
cleco power will be required to demonstrate that the costs incurred to construct rodemacher unit are prudently incurred and demonstrate the impact of the operation of the facility on its customers 
accordingly  cleco power may not be able to recover some of the costs incurred to construct the facility  which could be substantial 
furthermore  although the amended epc contract is generally a fixed price agreement  unforeseen events could result in changes in the scope of the project that may result in a cleco corporation cleco power form k delay in the completion of rodemacher unit or result in additional costs 
it may be more difficult to obtain lpsc approval to recover such additional costs 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover substantial costs incurred in the construction of the facility  such a decision could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
rodemacher unit technical specifications cleco power is exposed to certain risks related to the design  construction and operation of rodemacher unit this project has technology risk  fuel supply risk  and general contractor and certain material subcontractor performance risk 
rodemacher unit is designed to utilize circulating fluidized bed cfb generating technology 
under the amended epc contract  shaw is liable for liquidated damages for non performance 
however  cleco power s ability to collect any damages for breach is contingent on the demonstration of such damages and on shaw s financial abilities 
failure by shaw to meet its obligations under the amended epc contract could have a material adverse impact on the plant s efficiency  in service date  and final cost 
the amended epc contract does not protect cleco power against force majeure events or design specification oversight which may result in increased and potentially unrecoverable costs to cleco power 
although cleco power currently delivers coal via rail to the rodemacher facility  plans are for rodemacher unit to primarily use petroleum coke  which can be delivered most economically via barges on the mississippi and red rivers  requiring a conveyor system which crosses an interstate and local highways 
navigable waterway events such as blockages or low water  or conveyor outages could impact cleco power s ability to transport and deliver fuel to rodemacher unit global financial crisis the global financial crisis may negatively impact cleco s business and financial condition 
the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may have an impact on cleco s business and financial condition 
cleco may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve 
cleco s ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when cleco would like  or need  to do so  which could have a material impact on its ability to fund capital expenditures or debt service or on cleco s flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
if cleco corporation s or cleco power s credit ratings were to be downgraded by moody s or by standard poor s  cleco corporation or cleco power  as the case may be  would be required to pay additional fees and higher interest rates under its bank credit and other debt agreements 
during  cleco s pension plan portfolio experienced significant losses and may experience further losses in the future 
the losses  in conjunction with plan funding requirements  could result in required pension plan contributions significantly higher and earlier than previously anticipated  which could have a material negative impact on cleco s results of operations and financial condition 
further  the credit crisis could have a material negative impact on cleco s lenders or its customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations to cleco or to delay payment of such obligations 
additionally  the crisis could lead to reduced electricity usage  which could have a material negative impact on cleco s results of operations and financial condition 
future electricity sales cleco power s future electricity sales and corresponding base revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
general market conditions can negatively impact the businesses of cleco power s industrial customers  resulting in decreased power purchases and lower base revenue 
the current u 
s 
recession could lead to reduced power usage by cleco power s customers 
cleco power s largest industrial customers  specifically those who manufacture wood and paper products who generated base revenue of approximately million in  have experienced a downturn in their respective markets 
the downturn in residential home construction has caused a significant reduction in the demand and prices for lumber and other wood products 
the paper industry has been vulnerable in recent years as a result of a mature market with pressures from overseas manufacturers 
reduced production or the shut down of any of these customers facilities could substantially reduce cleco power s base revenue 
the high cost of energy  in general  has become problematic in many industries and has increased interest by industrial customers in switching to alternative sources of energy  including on site power generation 
also  retail customers may consume less electricity due to increased conservation efforts or increased electric usage efficiency 
fuel cost audits the lpsc conducts fuel audits that could result in cleco power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue 
generally  fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the lpsc established fuel adjustment clause  which enables cleco power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges 
recovery of fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to a periodic fuel audit by the lpsc 
cleco power currently has fuel adjustment clause filings for through subject to review 
in july  the lpsc commenced a periodic fuel audit of cleco power s fuel adjustment clause filings for january through december this review is pending and cleco power does not anticipate the lpsc to proceed until the third quarter of management is currently unable to predict the timing of the fuel cost audits for the open years through cleco power could be required to make a substantial refund of cleco corporation cleco power form k previously recorded revenue as a result of these audits  and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the most recent audit completed by the lpsc covered and and resulted in a refund of million to cleco power s retail customers in the first quarter of hedging and risk management activities cleco power is subject to market risk associated with economic hedges relating to open natural gas contracts 
cleco has risk management policies which cannot eliminate all risk involved in its energy commodity activities 
cleco power utilizes economic hedges to mitigate the risks associated with a fixed price wholesale power contract that is not included in the fuel adjustment clause 
any realized gain or loss attributable to these hedges is recorded on the income statement as a component of operating revenue  net 
accordingly  changes in the market value of these hedging arrangements caused by natural gas price volatility will impact the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco power also has entered into economic hedge positions to mitigate the volatility in fuel costs passed through to its retail customers 
when these positions close  actual gains or losses are deferred and included in the fuel adjustment clause in the month the physical contract settles 
however  recovery of any of these fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to  and may be disallowed as part of  a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the lpsc 
cleco power manages its exposure to energy commodity activities by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures 
these risk limits and risk management procedures may not be as effective as planned  particularly if intentional misconduct is involved  and cannot eliminate all risk associated with these activities 
purchased power nonperformance of cleco power s power purchase agreements and transmission constraints could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco power does not supply all of its customers power from the generation facilities it owns and must purchase additional energy and capacity from the wholesale power market in order to meet customers demands 
during  cleco power met approximately of its energy needs with purchased power 
a mw power purchase agreement with bear energy  which expires in  and other short and long term power purchase agreements provided approximately of cleco power s capacity needs in cleco power plans to meet its energy and capacity needs with the bear energy mw contract  a mw contract with acadia power partners  a mw long term contract with sabine river authority  and a mw wholesale power contract with the city of natchitoches 
on january   cleco issued a rfp for a minimum capacity amount of mw up to mw in order to serve additional load 
on february   a winning bidder was selected 
cleco power is currently negotiating the terms of the contract and anticipates signing a power purchase agreement by the end of the first quarter of the requested products for supply will start april  and continue through october  if any provider of additional energy or capacity does not perform under their respective contracts  cleco power would have to replace these supply sources with alternative market sources  the terms of which may not be as favorable and could increase the ultimate cost of power to cleco power s customers 
because of cleco power s location on the transmission grid  cleco power relies on two main suppliers of electric transmission when accessing external power markets 
at times  physical constraints limit the amount of purchased power these transmission providers can deliver into cleco power s service territory  which in turn can affect capacity or power purchases under long term contracts  as well as spot market power purchases 
if the amount of purchased power actually delivered into cleco s transmission system were less than the amount of power contracted for delivery  cleco power may rely on its own generation facilities to meet customer demand 
cleco power s incremental generation cost at that time could be higher than the cost to purchase power from the wholesale power market  thereby increasing its customers ultimate cost 
in addition  the lpsc may not allow cleco power to recover part or all of its incremental generation cost  which could be substantial 
commodity prices cleco power is subject to the fluctuation in the market prices of various commodities which may increase the cost of producing power 
cleco power purchases coal  lignite  natural gas and fuel oil under long term contracts and on the spot market 
historically  the markets for oil  natural gas and coal have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
cleco power s retail rates include a fuel adjustment clause that enables it to adjust rates for monthly fluctuations in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
however  recovery of any of these fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to  and may be disallowed as part of  a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the lpsc 
evangeline plant performance evangeline has certain plant performance obligations defined in its tolling agreement 
failure to perform these obligations could expose evangeline to adverse financial penalties 
performance requirements in the evangeline tolling agreement include  but are not limited to  maintaining plant performance characteristics such as heat rate and demonstrated generation capacity and maintaining specified availability levels with a combination of plant availability and replacement power 
cleco corporation cleco power form k obligations under the tolling agreement include  but are not limited to  maintaining various types of insurance  maintaining power and natural gas metering equipment  and paying scheduled interest and principal payments on debt 
in addition to the performance obligations by evangeline  there are a guarantee and various commitments required by cleco corporation 
if evangeline fails to operate within specified requirements  the facility may purchase replacement power on the open market and provide it to the tolling counterparty in order to meet contractual performance specifications 
providing replacement power maintains availability levels  but exposes evangeline to power commodity price volatility and transmission constraints 
if availability targets under the tolling agreement are not met and economical purchased power and transmission are not available  cleco corporation s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
cleco power generation facilities cleco power s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages  significant maintenance requirements and interruption of fuel deliveries 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel supply interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
some of cleco power s facilities were originally constructed many years ago 
older equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant expenditures to operate at peak efficiency or availability 
if cleco power fails to make adequate expenditures for equipment maintenance  cleco power risks incurring more frequent unplanned outages  higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures  increased fuel or power purchase costs  and potentially the loss of revenue related to competitive opportunities 
cleco power s generating facilities are fueled primarily by coal  natural gas  and lignite 
the deliverability of these fuel sources may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand  production shortages  weather related disturbances or lack of transportation capacity 
if the suppliers are unable to deliver the contracted volume of fuel  cleco power would have to replace any deficiency with alternative sources  which may not be as favorable and could increase the ultimate cost of fuel to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered from customers through the fuel adjustment clause  which is subject to refund until either a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit is conducted by the lpsc 
ero in  ferc s authority was expanded to include the establishment and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards on the transmission system  as well as the capacity to impose fines and civil penalties on those who fail to comply with those standards 
the energy policy act of authorizes the creation of an ero with authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards  subject to ferc approval  for users of the nation s transmission system 
in july  ferc named nerc as the ero 
ferc has approved more than reliability standards developed by nerc 
a final order was issued by ferc in march  and in june  ferc began enforcing compliance with these standards 
new standards are continually being developed and existing standards will be modified as needed 
as these standards continue to be adopted and modified  they may impose additional compliance requirements on cleco power  acadia  and evangeline operations which may result in an increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses 
failure to comply with the reliability standards approved by ferc can result in the imposition of fines and civil penalties 
environmental compliance cleco s costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant 
the costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations  as well as the incurrence of incremental environmental liabilities  could be significant to the registrants 
cleco is subject to extensive environmental oversight by federal  state  and local authorities and is required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations related to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources  and health and safety 
cleco also is required to obtain and comply with numerous governmental permits in operating its facilities 
existing environmental laws  regulations and permits could be revised or reinterpreted  and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to cleco 
for example  congress is considering climate change legislation that  if ultimately enacted  could impose a cap on co emissions by electric generating units such as cleco and subject electric generating units to an emissions allowance based trading system 
cleco may incur significant capital expenditures or additional operating costs to comply with these revisions  reinterpretations  and new requirements 
if cleco fails to comply with these revisions  reinterpretations  and requirements  it could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines or may be forced to shut down or reduce productions from its facilities 
environmental advocacy groups  states  other organizations  some government agencies  and the new presidential administration are focusing considerable attention on co emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change 
future changes in environmental regulations governing co could make some of cleco s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate 
in addition  any legal obligation that would require cleco to substantially reduce its co emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and could raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
cleco power may request recovery from its retail customers of its costs to comply with new environmental laws and cleco corporation cleco power form k regulations 
if revenue relief were to be approved by the lpsc  then cleco power s retail rates could increase 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs  such an adverse decision could have a material effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
regulatory compliance cleco operates in a highly regulated environment and adverse regulatory decisions or changes in applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on the registrants businesses or result in significant additional costs 
cleco s business is subject to extensive federal  state  and local energy  environmental and other laws and regulations 
the lpsc regulates cleco s retail operations  and ferc regulates cleco s wholesale operations 
the construction  planning  and siting of cleco s power plants and transmission lines also are subject to the jurisdiction of the lpsc and ferc 
additional regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over some of cleco s operations and construction projects including the epa  the united states bureau of land management  the united states fish and wildlife services  the united states department of energy  the united states army corps of engineers  the united states department of homeland security  the occupational safety and health administration  the united states department of transportation  the ldeq  the louisiana department of health and hospitals  the louisiana department of natural resources  the louisiana department of public safety  regional water quality boards  and various local regulatory districts 
cleco must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective orders 
should cleco be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on cleco  cleco s business could be adversely affected 
existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to cleco or cleco s facilities in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on the registrants business or result in significant additional costs because of cleco s need to comply with those requirements 
weather sensitivity the operating results of cleco power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity  particularly kwh sales to residential customers 
in cleco power s service territory  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months 
as a result  cleco power s financial results may fluctuate on a seasonal basis 
in addition  cleco power has sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions were milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could adversely impact the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
severe weather  including hurricanes and winter storms  can be destructive  causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses and lower revenue 
termination of the rodemacher unit project or the amended epc contract the abandonment of the rodemacher unit project or termination of the amended epc contract could result in unrecoverable costs 
cleco power may determine that its decision to construct  own and operate rodemacher unit is no longer justified due to changes in circumstances or for other reasons 
if cleco power decided to abandon the project  the lpsc may not allow cleco power to recover some or all of its incurred costs 
the amended epc contract allows cleco power to terminate the agreement at its sole discretion  but exercise of this termination right would require cleco power to pay termination costs  subject to specified limitations 
at december   the maximum termination costs would have been million payable to shaw 
termination costs under the amended epc contract could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
retail electric service cleco power s retail electric rates and business practices are regulated by the lpsc 
cleco power s retail rates for residential  commercial  and industrial customers and other retail sales are regulated by the lpsc  which conducts an annual review of cleco power s earnings and regulatory return on equity 
cleco power files annual monitoring reports with the lpsc for month periods ended september cleco power could be required to make a substantial refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of the lpsc review  and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco credit ratings a downgrade in cleco corporation s or cleco power s credit rating could result in an increase in their respective borrowing costs and a reduced pool of potential investors and funding sources 
while the senior unsecured debt ratings of cleco corporation and cleco power are currently investment grade  in recent years such ratings have been downgraded or put on negative watch by moody s and standard poor s 
cleco corporation or cleco power cannot assure that its current debt ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of its debt ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
if moody s or standard poor s were to downgrade cleco corporation or cleco power s long term ratings  particularly below investment cleco corporation cleco power form k grade  the value of their debt securities would likely be adversely affected  and the borrowing cost of cleco corporation or cleco power would likely increase 
in addition  cleco corporation or cleco power would likely be required to pay higher interest rates in future debt financings and be subject to more onerous debt covenants  and its pool of potential investors and funding sources could decrease 
holding company cleco corporation is a holding company  and its ability to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the cash generated by its subsidiaries 
cleco corporation is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries 
substantially all of cleco s consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  cleco s ability to meet its debt obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon the cash generated by these subsidiaries 
cleco s subsidiaries are separate and distinct entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on cleco s debt or to make any funds available for such payment 
in addition  cleco s subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to cleco may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding securities and to other general business creditors 
moreover  cleco power  cleco s principal subsidiary  is subject to regulation by the lpsc  which may impose limits on the amount of dividends that cleco power may pay cleco corporation 
evangeline tolling agreement failure by jpmorgan chase co 
to fulfill its guarantee obligations under the evangeline tolling agreement could have a material adverse effect on cleco s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
in may  jpmorgan chase co 
acquired bear stearns companies inc in connection with the acquisition  jpmorgan chase co 
has guaranteed certain obligations of bear stearns companies inc s subsidiaries  including bear energy s obligations under the evangeline tolling agreement 
if jpmorgan chase co 
or any successor or assignee were to fail to perform its payment obligations  such failure could have a material adverse effect on cleco corporation s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows for the following reasons  among others if such failure to perform constituted a default under the tolling agreement  the holders of the evangeline bonds would have the right to declare the outstanding principal amount million at december  and interest to be immediately due and payable  which could result in o cleco s seeking to refinance the bonds  the terms of which may be less favorable than existing terms  o cleco s causing evangeline to seek protection under federal bankruptcy laws  or o the trustee of the bonds foreclosing on the mortgage and assuming ownership of the evangeline plant  cleco may not be able to enter into agreements in replacement of the evangeline tolling agreement on terms as favorable as that agreement or at all  cleco s equity investment in evangeline may be impaired  requiring a write down to its fair market value  which could be substantial  and cleco s credit ratings could be downgraded  which would increase borrowing costs and limit sources of financing 
evangeline and acadia generation facilities evangeline s and acadia s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages  significant maintenance requirements  interruption of fuel deliveries  and transmission constraints 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel interruption  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
if adequate expenditures for equipment maintenance are not made  a facility may incur more frequent unplanned outages  higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures  increased fuel costs  and potentially the loss of revenue related to competitive opportunities 
evangeline s and acadia s generating facilities are fueled by natural gas 
the deliverability of this fuel source may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand  production shortages  weather related disturbances or lack of transportation capacity 
because of acadia s location on the transmission grid  acadia relies on two main suppliers of electric transmission when accessing external power markets 
however  at times  physical constraints limit the amount of power these transmission providers can deliver
