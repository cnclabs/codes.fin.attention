item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item  included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion also contains forward looking statements that include risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
business overview we are an automated global electronic market maker and broker specializing in routing orders and executing and processing trades in securities  futures and foreign exchange instruments on more than electronic exchanges and trading venues around the world 
since our inception in  we have focused on developing proprietary software to automate broker dealer functions 
the advent of electronic exchanges in the last years has provided us with the opportunity to integrate our software with an increasing number of exchanges and trading venues into one automatically functioning  computerized platform that requires minimal human intervention 
in connection with the ipo priced on may   ibg  inc purchased of the membership interests in ibg llc  became the sole managing member of ibg llc and began to consolidate ibg llc s financial results into its financial statements 
overview of recapitalization transactions and our organizational structure prior to the ipo  we had historically conducted our business through a limited liability company structure 
our primary assets are our ownership of approximately of the membership interests of ibg llc  the current holding company for our businesses  and our controlling interest and related contractual rights as the sole managing member of ibg llc 
the remaining approximately of ibg llc membership interests are held by ibg holdings llc  a holding company that is owned by our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  thomas peterffy  and his affiliates  management and other employees of ibg llc  and certain other members 
the ibg llc membership interests held by ibg holdings llc will be subject to purchase by us over time in connection with offerings by us of shares of our common stock 
business segments the company reports its results in two business segments  market making and electronic brokerage 
these segments are analyzed separately as we derive our revenues from these two principal business activities as well as allocate resources and assess performance 
market making 
we conduct our market making business through our th subsidiaries 
as one of the largest market makers on many of the world s leading exchanges  we provide liquidity by offering competitively tight bid offer spreads over a broad base of approximately  tradable  exchange listed products 
as principal  we commit our own capital and derive revenues or incur losses from the difference between the price paid when securities are bought and the price received when those securities are sold 
because we provide continuous bid and offer quotations and we are continuously both buying and selling quoted securities  we may have either a long or a short position in a particular product at a given point in time 
our entire portfolio is evaluated each second and continuously rebalanced throughout the trading day  thus minimizing the risk of our portfolio at all times 
this real time rebalancing of our portfolio  together with our real time proprietary risk management system  enables us to curtail risk and to be profitable in both up market and down market scenarios 
electronic brokerage 
we conduct our electronic brokerage business through our ib subsidiaries 
as an electronic broker  we execute  clear and settle trades globally for both institutional and individual customers 
capitalizing on the technology originally developed for our market making business  ib s systems provide our customers with the capability to monitor multiple markets around the world simultaneously and to execute trades electronically in these markets at a low cost  in multiple products and currencies from a single trading account 
we offer our customers access to all classes of tradable  exchange listed products  including stocks  bonds  options  futures and forex  traded on more than exchanges and market centers and in countries around the world seamlessly 
business environment as a global market maker and broker  our operations are significantly affected by economic conditions and trends in the world s financial markets 
our results are influenced by several unpredictable  random elements 
this has the effect of creating an irregular earnings stream from one reporting period to the next 
for example  our market making profits are materially driven by volatility and trading volumes  both of which behaved erratically during the year 
foreign currency markets were also very volatile which further contributed to this unpredictable earnings pattern 
throughout  we witnessed a series of extreme events that originated in the prior year within the financial markets and created a negative ripple effect across all sectors and geographic regions leading to a major economic downturn 
the tightening of the credit markets that began in eventually led to the failure or restructuring of several major financial institutions  and a significant increase in federal governmental intervention and historical levels of volatility 
we have been relatively unaffected by these events 
we do not hold any mortgage derivatives or credit default swaps  nor do we trade over the counter instruments  all of which contributed to massive losses across the financial sector 
with the exception of cash foreign exchange  we trade only exchange listed instruments  which are highly liquid and have readily determinable values and cleared through central clearing houses 
we have managed to avoid the negative consequences of this market crisis  and in fact  our market making operations have benefited from extreme volatility  which reached historic levels in  and elevated volume of trading  both of which fuel our trading gains 
for much of the year  we also saw a reduction in competition by so called high frequency traders that utilize computerized algorithms to employ profit making strategies 
this form of competition tends to decline during times of extreme volatility  though the phenomenon is cyclical and we are likely to see it return to higher levels as markets stabilize 
our brokerage business has benefited from recent events as well 
the changing landscape amongst brokers and heightened concern by investors over financial safety has provided us with a unique opportunity to grow our customer base by highlighting our stability and conservative risk profile and acquiring displaced customers of failed brokerages 
option volumes continued to rise throughout the first half of however  activity began to slow down when the market crisis escalated late in the year 
according to data compiled by the fia and based on data received from exchanges worldwide  volumes in exchange listed equity based options increased by approximately globally and in the us during the year ended december   compared to the same period in this is a continuation of a trend we have observed over the past eight years  and we believe that as the equity culture spreads around the world  after a brief period of interruption  this trend is likely to continue 
we have also observed a rise in certain types of options activity that are driven by non trading strategies 
one such strategy results in spikes in trading volume prior to ex dividend dates that would appear to be overstating the exchange reported volumes  especially in the united states 
such activity does not represent trades with which other market participants  including market makers and customers  can interact 
we cannot estimate the impact this activity has on overall trading volumes 
in  the sec continued its rollout of the penny pricing pilot program which was introduced in february options in this program trade in minimum price increments of one cent  rather than the five and ten cent increments quoted in other options classes 
overall  the results of this program have been favorable to our business  which we believe is a reflection of our ability to compete at narrower bid offer spreads 
penny pricing was extended to options classes by the end of  which accounts for over of us options volume 
according to data compiled by the fia and based on data received from exchanges worldwide  in we accounted for approximately of the exchange listed equity based options including options in etf s and stock index products volume traded worldwide and approximately of exchange listed equity based options volume traded in the us this compares to approximately of the exchange listed equity based options volume traded worldwide and approximately of the exchange listed equity based options volume traded in the us in financial overview diluted earnings per share were for year ended december  the calculation of diluted earnings per share is detailed in note  initial public offering and recapitalization  to the audited consolidated financial statements  in part ii  item of this annual report on form k

for the year ended december   our net revenues were  million and income before income taxes and minority interest was  million  compared to net revenues of  million and income before income taxes of million for trading gains increased in  compared to the same period last year and commissions and execution fees increased by for the same time period  while net interest income decreased 
our pre tax margin for the year ended december  was  compared to for during the year ended december   income before income taxes in our market making segment increased  compared with the same period in a healthy increase in trading gains was driven by a productive trading environment throughout most of the year when trading volumes and volatility in the markets presented our automated trading system with more opportunities to trade 
pre tax margin increased to in compared to in our strong capital position  which allows us to maintain more than billion of excess regulatory capital  together with committed standby financing facilities  allowed us to make markets continuously during the period of constrained liquidity throughout the year 
during the year ended december   income before income taxes in our electronic brokerage segment grew compared to the same period in  reflecting higher revenues from commissions and execution fees 
pre tax margin decreased from to in the same time periods 
the increase in commissions and execution fees was related to strong growth in transaction volume and customer accounts 
total daily average revenue trades darts for cleared and execution only customers increased to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  market making  by its nature  does not produce predictable earnings 
our results in any given period may be materially affected by volumes in the global financial markets  the level of competition and other factors 
electronic brokerage is more predictable  but it is dependent on customer activity  growth in customer accounts and assets  interest rates and other factors 
for a further discussion of the factors  that may affect our future operating results  please see the description of risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
the following two tables present net revenues and income before income taxes for each of our business segments for the periods indicated 
net revenues of each of our business segments and our total net revenues are summarized below year ended december  in millions market making   electronic brokerage corporate total corporate includes corporate related activities as well as inter segment eliminations 
income before income taxes of each of our business segments and our total income before income taxes are summarized below year ended december  in millions market making  electronic brokerage corporate total  corporate includes corporate related activities as well as inter segment eliminations 
revenue trading gains our revenue base is comprised largely of trading gains generated in the normal course of market making 
trading revenues are  in general  proportional to the trading activity in the markets 
our revenue base is highly diversified and comprised of millions of relatively small individual trades of various financial products traded on electronic exchanges  primarily stocks  options and futures 
trading gains accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trading gains also include translation gains and losses on cash and positions in foreign currency held primarily by our foreign market making subsidiaries as well as revenues from net dividends 
market making activities require us to hold a substantial inventory of equity securities 
we derive significant revenues in the form of dividend income from these equity securities 
this dividend income is largely offset by dividend expense incurred when we make significant payments in lieu of dividends on short positions in securities in our portfolio 
dividend income and expense arise from holding market making positions over dates on which dividends are paid to shareholders of record 
when a stock pays a dividend  its market price is generally adjusted downward to reflect the value paid to the shareholders of record  which will not be received by those who purchase the stock after the dividend date 
hence  the apparent gains and losses due to these price changes must be taken together with the dividends paid and received  respectively  in order to accurately reflect the results of our market making operations 
as a result of the way we have integrated our market making and securities lending systems  our trading gains and our net interest income from the market making segment are interchangeable and depend on the mix of market making positions in our portfolio 
when implied interest rates in the equity and equity options and futures markets exceed the actual interest rates available to us  our market making systems tend to buy stock and sell it forward  which produces higher trading gains and lower net interest income 
when these rates are inverted  our market making systems tend to sell stock and buy it forward  which produces lower trading gains and higher net interest income 
our trading gains are geographically diversified 
in  and  we generated  and  respectively  of our trading gains from operations conducted internationally 
commissions and execution fees we earn commissions and execution fees from our cleared customers for whom we act as executing and clearing brokers and from our non cleared customers for whom we act as an executing broker only 
we have a commission structure that allows customers to choose between an all inclusive bundled rate or an unbundled rate that has lower commissions for high volume customers 
for unbundled commissions  we charge regulatory and exchange fees  at our cost  separately from our commissions  adding transparency to our fee structure 
commissions and execution fees accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our commissions and execution fees are geographically diversified 
in  and we generated  and  respectively of commissions and execution fees from operations conducted internationally 
interest income and interest expense we earn interest on customer funds segregated in safekeeping accounts  on customer borrowings on margin  secured by marketable securities these customers hold with us  from our investment in government treasury securities  from borrowing securities in the general course of our market making and brokerage activities  and on bank balances 
interest income accounted for  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income is partially offset by interest expense 
we pay interest on cash balances customers hold with us  for cash received from lending securities in the general course of our market making and brokerage activities  and on our borrowings 
interest expense was  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have automated and integrated our securities lending system with our trading system 
as a result  we have been able to tailor our securities lending activity to produce more optimal results when taken together with trading gains see description under trading gains above 
our net interest income accounted for approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other income other income consists primarily of payment for order flow income  mark to market gains on non traded securities primarily investments in exchanges and market data fee income 
our other income accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs and expenses execution and clearing expenses our largest single expense category is execution and clearing expenses  which includes the costs of executing and clearing our market making and electronic brokerage trades  as well as other direct expenses  including payment for order flow  regulatory fees and market data fees 
execution fees are paid primarily to electronic exchanges and market centers on which we trade 
clearing fees are paid to clearing houses and clearing agents 
payments for order flow are made as part of exchange mandated programs and to otherwise attract order volume to our system 
market data fees are fees that we must pay to third parties to receive streaming quotes and related information 
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits includes salaries  bonuses  group insurance  contributions to benefit programs and other related employee costs 
occupancy  depreciation and amortization occupancy expense consists primarily of rental payments on office and data center leases and related occupancy costs  such as utilities 
depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of fixed assets such as computing and communications hardware as well as amortization of leasehold improvements and capitalized in house software development 
communications communications expense consists primarily of the cost of voice and data telecommunications lines supporting our business including connectivity to exchanges around the world 
general and administrative expenses in this category are primarily incurred for professional services  such as legal and audit work  and other operating expenses such as advertising and exchange membership lease expenses 
as a public company since may   we are incurring additional costs for external services such as legal  accounting and auditing 
income tax expense historically  our business was operated through a limited liability company that was not subject to us federal and certain state income taxes  our income tax expense consisted primarily of corporate subsidiary taxes  and our net income did not reflect cash distributions to ibg llc s members to pay their taxes related to their proportionate shares of our net income 
those distributions reduced ibg llc s members capital 
after the ipo  we became subject to taxes applicable to c corporations 
as a corporation  we are required to pay us federal  state and local income taxes on our taxable income  which is proportional to the percentage of ibg llc owned by ibg 
our subsidiaries will continue to be subject to income tax in the respective jurisdictions in which they operate 
minority interest we are the sole managing member of ibg llc and  as such  operate and control all of the business and affairs of ibg llc and its subsidiaries and consolidate ibg llc s financial results into our financial statements 
we hold approximately ownership interest in ibg llc 
ibg holdings llc is owned by the original members of ibg llc and holds approximately ownership interest in ibg llc 
we reflect ibg holdings llc s ownership as a minority interest in our statement of financial condition and statement of income 
our historical results are those of ibg llc  as our predecessor company 
as a result  our net income  after excluding ibg holdings llc s minority interest  represents approximately of ibg llc s net income and similarly  outstanding shares of our common stock represent approximately of the outstanding membership interests of ibg llc 
certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our continuing operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
over the past several years  the effects of market structure changes  competition and market conditions have  during certain periods  exerted downward pressure on bid offer spreads realized by market makers 
retail broker dealer participation in the equity markets has fluctuated over the past few years due to investor sentiment  market conditions and a variety of other factors 
retail transaction volumes may not be sustainable and are not predictable 
in recent years  in an effort to improve the quality of their executions as well as increase efficiencies  market makers have increased the level of automation within their operations  which may allow them to compete more effectively with us 
there has been increased scrutiny of equity and option market makers  hedge funds and soft dollar practices by the regulatory and legislative authorities 
new legislation or modifications to existing regulations and rules could occur in the future 
there has been consolidation among market centers over the past few years  which may adversely affect the value of our smart routing software 
a driver of our market making profits is the relationship between actual and implied volatility in the equities markets 
the cost of maintaining our conservative risk profile is based on implied volatility  while our profitability  in part  is based on actual volatility 
hence  our profitability is increased when actual volatility runs above implied volatility and it is decreased when actual volatility falls below implied volatility 
implied volatility tends to lag actual volatility 
see risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the tables in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our revenues and expenses 
the period to period comparisons below of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
historical results of operations are reported as a limited liability company until the ipo and do not include delaware franchise tax  minority interest  and federal and certain state income taxes 
such items are included in subsequent periods

as stated above  the apparent gains and losses due to these price changes  reflecting the value of dividends paid to shareholders  must be taken together with the dividends paid and received  respectively  in order to accurately reflect the results of our market making operations 
as part of managing our overall exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  we maintain a portion of our capital in foreign currencies 
translation gains of million were recognized in the year ended december   on foreign currency balances held by our subsidiaries  compared to translation gains of million for the year ended december  a discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
commissions and execution fees 
commissions and execution fees for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher customer trading volume on an expanded customer base 
total darts for cleared and execution only customers for the year ended december  increased to  compared to  during the year ended december  darts for cleared customers  ie  customers for whom we execute trades as well as clear and carry positions  increased to approximately  for the year ended december   compared to approximately  for the year ended december  the number of customer accounts grew by to approximately  at december   compared to approximately  at december  average commission per dart for cleared customers  for the year ended december   decreased by  or  to  as compared to for the year ended december   primarily due to smaller order size which is typical in fast moving markets 
interest income and interest expense 
net interest income interest income less interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  net interest income from market making  which accounted for of total net interest income  contracted to million  a decrease of from the same period last year 
as a result of the way we have integrated our market making and securities lending systems  our trading income and our net interest income are interchangeable and depend on the mix of market making positions in our portfolio 
when implied interest rates in the equity and equity options and futures markets exceed the actual interest rates available to us  our market making systems tend to buy stock and sell it forward  which produces higher trading gains and lower net interest income 
when these rates are inverted  our market making systems tend to sell stock and buy it forward  which produces lower trading gains and higher net interest income 
the relative interest rates during resulted in a mix of positions that produced more trading income and less interest income 
in addition  average securities borrowed decreased by  to billion and average securities loaned decreased by  to billion  for the year ended december   as market making positions contracted 
customer cash balances decreased by  to billion  end of period  and customer fully secured margin borrowings decreased  to billion  end of period  at december   as compared to billion and billion  end of period  respectively  at december  lower interest rates have had a negative effect on the net interest income we earned on small customer cash balances 
the average fed funds effective rate dropped basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  net interest earned in electronic brokerage decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  other income 
other income  for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in payment for order flow income received by our brokerage unit  primarily due to the options penny pricing program which was introduced in february and extended to options classes in march and a million write down in our equity investment in wr hambrecht co 
inc these were offset by a million increase in rebates from market centers for liquidity provided by our us market making unit and a million increase in market data fee income 
non interest expenses non interest expenses  for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million from million  during the year ended december  execution and clearing expenses made up and employee compensation and benefits were of non interest expenses 
as a percentage of total net revenues  non interest expenses declined to for the year ended december  from during the same period in execution and clearing 
execution and clearing expenses  for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  execution and clearing expenses  outside of payment for order flow expenses  increased by million  or  to million primarily due to increased trading volume across the markets in which the group and its customers traded 
payments to order flow customers  a component of execution and clearing costs  for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to discontinued servicing  which began at the end of the second quarter in  of certain non cleared broker dealer customers who received payment for order flow  and had a positive impact on our operating margins in the year ended december  payment for order flow expense was partially offset by payment for order flow revenue received from us options exchanges  as described above under net revenues other income 
employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits expenses  for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  this increase reflected the continued phase in of expenses related to our employee stock incentive plan and the growth in the average number of employees to at december   as compared to at december  as we continue to grow  our focus on automation has allowed us to maintain a relatively small staff 
as a percentage of total net revenues  employee compensation and benefits expenses were and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
occupancy  depreciation and amortization 
occupancy  depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to increased expenses for additional office and data center space and additional amortization of assets related to our acquisition of future trade technologies at the end of as a percentage of total net revenues  occupancy  depreciation and amortization expenses were for each of the years ended december  and communications 
communications expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by additional telecommunications bandwidth required to support increased trading volume at electronic exchanges and the expansion in the number of markets in which ibg llc operates 
as a percentage of total net revenues  communications expenses were for each of the years ended december  and general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december   primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt expense of approximately million related uncollectable customer losses related to corporate action processing  trading errors and software errors  in addition to increases in advertising expenditures 
income tax expense 
ibg llc historically operated in the united states as a limited liability company that was treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  ibg llc s income was not subject to us federal income taxes 
subsequent to the ipo in may  income taxes have been provided for our proportionate share of ibg llc s income that is subject to federal and state income taxes 
as a result  income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million 
net income excluding the adjustment for minority interest increased million or to  million for the year ended december   as compared to million on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  net income excluding the adjustment for minority interest as a percentage of net revenues was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues total net revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the year ended december  trading volume is the most important driver of revenues and costs for both our market making and electronic brokerage segments 
based on data published by the fia and options exchanges worldwide  global equity options volume increased by approximately  as compared to for the year ended december   equity option contracts executed by our subsidiaries increased by million  or  to million contracts from million contracts for the year ended december  trading gains 
trading gains increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   our market making operations executed million trades  a increase over the million trades executed during the year ended december  the second half of the year was marked by high market volumes combined with high volatility  which allowed us to leverage our automated trading systems 
in contrast  trading gains during the first half of the year were negatively affected by an unusual  non recurring loss and by unexpectedly heavy options activity in advance of certain corporate announcements 
the latter has a negative impact because  when we trade with others who have different information than we do  we may accumulate unfavorable positions preceding large price movements in the stocks of companies that announce corporate actions 
we maintain a portion of our capital in foreign currencies 
in the second half of  we observed broad based gains in the value of foreign currencies measured in us dollars 
translation gains of million were recognized in the year ended december  on foreign currency balances held primarily by our european subsidiaries  compared to translation losses of million  for the year ended december  a discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
commissions and execution fees 
commissions and execution fees increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher customer trading volume on an expanded customer base 
total darts for cleared and execution only customers increased  to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  darts for cleared customers  a subset that refers to those customers for whom we execute trades as well as clear and carry positions  increased to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the number of customer accounts grew by to approximately  at december   compared to approximately  at december  average commission per dart for cleared customers increased by  or  to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december   primarily due to larger average trades from our cleared customers 
interest income and interest expense 
net interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  growth in net interest income was primarily attributable to higher net interest from securities lending and increases in net customer cash and margin balances in addition to a higher capital base in the business 
net interest income from market making  which accounted for of total net interest income  grew to million during the year ended december   an increase of for the year ended december  this was driven by the continuing integration of our market making systems with our securities lending systems  which allow us to maintain a profitable interest rate spread despite reduced positions 
average securities borrowed decreased by  to billion  and average securities loaned decreased  to billion  for the year ended december  these decreases reflect a reduction in stock positions held by our market making units and the increase in our equity capital  which reduced the need to finance positions through securities lending 
customer cash balances increased by  to billion  and customer fully secured margin borrowings increased  to billion  at december   as compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  customer cash balances at december  include approximately billion from director and officer account balances 
in the third quarter  due to credit tightening in the market  the differential between the us dollar libor and fed funds interest rates widened 
on september  we changed our benchmark interest rate for interest on us dollar customer balances from the overnight us dollar libor rate to the fed funds effective rate in order to better match rates paid to customers with rates earned on our investments of customer funds 
we also shortened the target maturity on our investments of customer funds for this purpose 
net interest earned from customers cash balances and fully secured margin balances for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  as compared to the same period in other income 
other income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in rebates from market centers for liquidity provided by our us market making unit 
increases in market data fee income and payment for order flow income  which grew million and million  respectively  also contributed to the increase 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in mark to market gains on non trading securities  which primarily represents investments in exchanges 
payment for order flow income was partially offset by payment for order flow expense to our customers  as described below under non interest expenses execution and clearing 
non interest expenses non interest expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  execution and clearing expenses comprised and employee compensation and benefits were of non interest expenses 
as a percentage of total net revenues  non interest expenses fell to for the year ended december  from for the same period in execution and clearing 
execution and clearing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december   attributable to increases in trading volume 
payments for order flow  a component of execution and clearing costs decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to discontinued servicing  which took place at the end of the second quarter  of certain non cleared institutional customers who received payment for order flow 
this had a positive impact on our operating margins in the year ended december  payment for order flow expense was offset by payment for order flow revenue received from us options exchanges  as described above under net revenues other income 
employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a growth in the number of employees to at december  excluding employees of futuretrade technologies  llc from as of december   and increased employee benefits costs 
following our acquisition of futuretrade technologies  llc in december  our total staff count increased by  which had little impact on our compensation expenses for the year ended december  as we continue to grow  our focus on automation has allowed us to maintain a relatively small staff 
as a percentage of total net revenues  employee compensation and benefits expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
occupancy  depreciation and amortization 
occupancy  depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to increased office rent expenses for additional office space 
as a percentage of total net revenues  occupancy  depreciation and amortization expenses were for each of the years ended december  and communications 
communications expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by additional telecommunications bandwidth required to support increased trading volume at electronic exchanges and the expansion in the number of markets in which ibg llc operates 
as a percentage of total net revenues  communications expenses were for each of the years ended december  and general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily attributable to increased professional fees related to our ipo and public company status 
income tax expense 
ibg llc historically operated in the united states as a limited liability company that was treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  ibg llc s income was not subject to us federal income taxes 
subsequent to the ipo  income taxes have been provided for our proportionate share of the ibg llc s income that is subject to federal and state income taxes 
as a result  income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million 
this represents of the earnings prior to our ipo and actual earnings attributable to ibg  inc following the ipo 
as a result of our ipo  we recognized million in minority interest expense in net income excluding the adjustment for minority interest increased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  net income excluding the adjustment for minority interest as a percentage of net revenues was for each of the years ended december  and supplemental information the following tables present historical trading volumes for our business

in the following tables  revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining income before income taxes 
due to the integrated nature of the business segments  estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items 
transactions between segments generally result from one subsidiary facilitating the business of another subsidiary through the use of its existing trading memberships and clearing arrangements 
in such cases  certain revenue and expense items are eliminated in order to accurately reflect the external business conducted in each segment 
rates on transactions between segments are designed to approximate full costs 
in addition to execution and clearing expenses  which are the main cost driver for both the market making segment and the electronic brokerage segment  each segment s operating expenses include i employee compensation and benefits expenses that are incurred directly in support of the businesses  ii general and administrative expenses  which include directly incurred expenses for property leases  professional fees  travel and entertainment  communications and information services  equipment  and iii indirect support costs including compensation and other related operating expenses for administrative services provided by ibg llc 
such administrative services include  but are not limited to  computer software development and support  accounting  tax  legal and facilities management

trading gains also include translation gains and losses 
translation losses  for the year ended december   were million  as compared to translation gains of million  for the year ended december  net interest income  for the year ended december   decreased by million  or 
as described above  our trading income and our net interest income are interchangeable and depend on the mix of market making positions in our portfolio and on the relative interest rates in the stock and options markets 
in these factors produced more trading income and less interest income 
market making non interest expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  this small change resulted from a million decrease in execution and clearing costs offset by a million increase in employee compensation and benefits expenses and a million increase in general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in execution and clearing expenses reflects the reduction in exchange mandated payment for order flow program costs as more options are traded in pennies 
in addition  greater options volume was executed on us option exchanges that use the make or take model  where as a market maker we are paid for providing liquidity instead of paying exchange fees

liquidity and capital resources we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet 
the majority of our assets consist of exchange listed marketable securities inventories  which are marked to market daily  and collateralized receivables arising from customer related and proprietary securities transactions 
collateralized receivables consist primarily of securities borrowed  receivables from clearing houses for settlement of securities transactions and  to a lesser extent  customer margin loans and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
at december   total assets were billion of which approximately billion  or were considered liquid and consisted predominantly of marketable securities and collateralized receivables 
daily monitoring of liquidity needs and available collateral levels is undertaken to help ensure that an appropriate liquidity cushion  in the form of unpledged collateral  is maintained at all times 
our ability to quickly reduce funding needs by balance sheet contraction without adversely affecting our core businesses and to pledge additional collateral in support of secured borrowings is continuously evaluated to ascertain the adequacy of our capital base 
we actively manage or excess liquidity and we maintain significant borrowing facilities through the securities lending markets and with banks 
in response to changes in the credit market environment during late  we have substantially increased cash on hand 
this provides us with a buffer should we need immediately available funds for any reason 
in order to provide additional liquidity and to further increase our regulatory capital reserves  we issue senior notes and we maintain a committed senior secured revolving credit facility from a syndicate of banks see principal indebtedness below 
as of december   borrowings under these facilities totaled million  which represented of ibg llc s total capitalization 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flows from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for more than the next twelve months 
historically  our consolidated equity has consisted primarily of accumulated retained earnings  which to date have been sufficient to fund our operations and growth 
the consolidated equity of ibg llc grew from billion at december  to billion at december   representing an increase of 
cash flows the following table sets forth our cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions cash provided by used in operating activities  cash used in investing activities  cash used in provided by financing activities   effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our cash flows from operating activities are largely a reflection of the size and composition of trading positions held by our market making subsidiaries  and of the changes in customer cash and margin debit balances in our electronic brokerage business 
our cash flows from investing activities are primarily related to the purchase of interests in ibg llc from existing members  capitalized internal software development  purchases and sales of memberships at exchanges where we trade and strategic investments in exchanges where such investments will enable us to offer better execution alternatives to our current and prospective customers  or create new opportunities for ourselves as market makers or where we can influence exchanges to provide competing products at better prices using sophisticated technology 
our cash flows from financing activities are comprised of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the ipo  short term borrowings  long term borrowings and capital transactions 
short term borrowings from banks are part of our daily cash management in support of operating activities 
long term borrowings provide us with flexible sources of excess liquidity and regulatory capital  and they include a committed senior secured revolving credit facility from a syndicate of banks that was initiated in may  and senior notes issued in private placements to certain qualified customers of ib llc

the facility is secured by a first priority interest in all of the capital stock of each entity owned directly by ibg llc subject to customary limitations with respect to foreign subsidiaries 
the facility may be used to finance working capital needs and general corporate purposes  including downstreaming funds to ibg llc s regulated broker dealer subsidiaries as regulatory capital

since we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet  this will not have a material impact on our future cash needs 
senior notes ibg llc periodically issues senior notes in private placements to certain qualified customers of ib llc 
ibg llc uses the proceeds from sales of the senior notes to provide capital to ibg llc s broker dealer subsidiaries in the form of subordinated loans and for other general purposes 
the outstanding senior notes have a per annum interest rate  and either a month or an month maturity 
ibg llc may  solely at its option  redeem the senior notes at any time on or after a specified date in the third month or the sixth month  respectively  after the date on which the senior notes are issued and sold  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed plus accrued interest 
ibg llc had million and million of senior notes outstanding at december  and  respectively 
during the period from january through december   total senior notes issued were million  and senior notes redeemed totaled million 
the senior notes are secured  as is the senior secured revolving credit facility  by a first priority interest in all of the capital stock of each entity owned directly by ibg llc subject to customary limitations with respect to foreign subsidiaries 
the senior notes contain covenants that may limit ibg llc s ability to incur  or permit its subsidiaries to incur  additional indebtedness  create  or permit its subsidiaries to create  liens on any capital stock or equity interests of its subsidiaries  declare and pay dividends or make other equity distributions  and consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures are comprised of compensation costs of our software engineering staff for development of software for internal use and expenditures for computer  networking and communications hardware 
these expenditure items are reported as property and equipment 
capital expenditures for property and equipment were approximately million for each of the years ended december  and we anticipate that our gross capital expenditures to be at a similar level  including costs related to expansion of our data center and backup facilities 
we expect our future capital expenditures to rise as we continue our focus on technology infrastructure initiatives in order to further enhance our competitive position 
we anticipate that we will fund capital expenditures with cash from operations and cash on hand 
in response to changing economic conditions  we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them either upward or downward to match our actual performance 
if we pursue any strategic acquisitions  we may incur additional capital expenditures 
contractual obligations summary our contractual obligations principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and interest payments as of december  payments due by year total thereafter in millions senior notes interest payments on senior notes senior secured credit facili interest payments on senior secured credit facility operating leases total contractual cash obligations future principal and interest payments are calculated based on the assumption that all debt is outstanding until maturity 
additionally  as of december   we maintained standby letters of credit in the amount of million  of which million expire on demand and million expire in april seasonality our businesses are subject to seasonal fluctuations  reflecting varying numbers of market participants at times during the year and varying numbers of trading days from quarter to quarter  including declines in trading activity due to holidays 
typical seasonal trends may be superseded by market or world events  which can have a significant impact on prices and trading volume 
inflation although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we believe that inflation has not had for the three most recent years  and is not likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on our results of operations 
strategic investments and acquisitions we periodically engage in evaluations of potential strategic investments and acquisitions 
the company has made strategic investments in electronic trading exchanges including boston options exchange  llc  onechicago llc and cboe stock exchange  llc 
at december   the company had loans to and holds warrants to purchase approximately of wr hambrecht co 
inc see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k

during  the company also sold of its investment in cboe stock exchange llc for proceeds of million realizing a gain of thousand 
on november   the company closed on an acquisition of moriai securities  inc  a japanese broker dealer 
this acquisition is expected to facilitate our membership applications on japanese exchanges and clearing houses  as well as serve as a platform for customer business from japanese traders 
on december   ib llc closed on its acquisition of futuretrade technologies  llc ftt  a technology solutions provider to hedge funds and other institutional investors  and its wholly owned subsidiary  futuretrade securities  llc  which is an sec registered broker dealer 
we intend to continue making acquisitions on an opportunistic basis  generally only when the acquisition candidate will  in our opinion  enable us to acquire either technology or customers faster than we could develop them on our own 
at december   there were no definitive agreements with respect to any material acquisition 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements ibg  inc may be exposed to a risk of loss not reflected in the consolidated financial statements for futures products  which represent obligations of ibg  inc to settle at contracted prices  which may require repurchase or sale in the market at prevailing prices 
accordingly  these transactions result in off balance sheet risk as ibg  inc s cost to liquidate such futures contracts may exceed the amounts reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
critical accounting policies valuation of financial instruments due to the nature of our operations  substantially all of our financial instrument assets  comprised of securities owned  securities purchased under agreements to resell  securities borrowed and receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations are carried at fair value based on market prices  as published by exchanges and clearinghouses  and are marked to market daily  or are assets which are short term in nature such as u 
s 
government treasury bills or spot foreign exchange and are reflected at amounts approximating fair value 
similarly  all of our financial instrument liabilities that arise from securities sold but not yet purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  securities loaned and payables to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations are short term in nature and are reported at quoted market prices or at amounts approximating fair value 
our long and short positions are valued at either the last consolidated trade price or the last consolidated bid offer mid point where applicable at the close of regular trading hours  in the respective markets 
given that we manage a globally integrated market making portfolio  we have large and substantially offsetting positions in securities and commodities that trade on different exchanges that close at different times of the trading day 
as a result  there may be large and anomalous swings in the value of our positions daily and  accordingly  in our earnings in any period 
this is especially true on the last business day of each calendar quarter  although such swings tend to come back into equilibrium on the first business day of the succeeding calendar quarter 
contingencies our policy is to estimate and accrue for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings  to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
potential losses that might arise out of tax audits  to the extent that such losses are more likely than not  would be estimated and accrued in accordance with fasb interpretation fin no 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability accrued with respect to litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses based on  among other factors  the progress of each case  our experience with and industry experience with similar cases and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  or where cases or proceedings are in the early stages  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
we have been from time to time subject to litigation and other legal proceedings 
as of december   we  along with certain of our subsidiaries  have been named parties to legal actions  which we and or such subsidiaries intend to defend vigorously 
although the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty  it is the opinion of management that the resolution of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect  if any  on our business or financial condition  but may have a material impact on the results of operations for a given period 
as of december  and  reserves provided for potential losses related to litigation matters were not material 
use of estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in applying these principles  management is required to use certain assumptions and make estimates that could materially affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions  estimates and or judgments  however  are often subjective and our actual results may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates  the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
these estimates are periodically reevaluated by management 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions  estimates and or judgments

the company cannot anticipate whether adoption of sfas no

the ifrs roadmap would require sec registrants to prepare their financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board in ifrs is increasingly being applied by financial statement preparers in countries outside the us one of the stated purposes of the ifrs roadmap is that adopting ifrs will provide a global set of high quality accounting standards so that us investors would have an enhanced ability to compare financial information of us companies with that of non us companies 
in issuing the ifrs roadmap  the sec stated that  in  it will determine whether to proceed with rulemaking to require the use of ifrs by us registrants beginning in management is assessing the potential impact of adopting ifrs on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
our exposures to market risks arise from assumptions built into our pricing models  equity price risk  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations  changes in interest rates which impact our variable rate debt obligations  and risks relating to the extension of margin credit to our customers 
pricing model exposure our strategy as a market maker is to calculate quotes a few seconds ahead of the market and execute small trades at tiny but favorable differentials as a result 
this is made possible by our proprietary pricing model  which continuously evaluates and monitors the risks inherent in our portfolio  assimilates market data and reevaluates the outstanding quotes in our entire portfolio each second 
certain aspects of the model rely on historical prices of securities 
if the behavior of price movements of individual securities diverges substantially from what their historical behavior would predict  we might incur trading losses 
we attempt to limit such risks by diversifying our portfolio across many different options  futures and underlying securities and avoiding concentrations of positions based on the same underlying security 
historically  our losses from these events have been immaterial in comparison to our annual trading profits 
foreign currency exposure as a result of our international market making activities and accumulated earnings in our foreign subsidiaries  our income and net worth is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our european operations and some of our asian operations are conducted by our swiss subsidiary  the 
the is regulated by the swiss federal banking commission as a securities dealer and its financial statements are presented in swiss francs 
accordingly  the is exposed to certain foreign exchange risks as described below the buys and sells futures contracts and securities denominated in various currencies and carries bank balances and borrows and lends such currencies in its regular course of business 
at the end of each accounting period the s assets and liabilities are translated into swiss francs for presentation in its financial statements 
the resulting gains or losses are reported as translation gain or loss in the s income statement 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  the s swiss franc balances are translated into us dollars for us gaap purposes 
the s translation gains or losses appear as such on ibg  inc s income statement  included in trading gains 
the s net worth is carried on the s books in swiss francs in accordance with swiss accounting standards 
at the end of each accounting period  the s net worth is translated at the then prevailing exchange rate into us dollars and the resulting gain or loss is reported in our consolidated statement of financial condition as other comprehensive income  which is neither an income nor an expense item in our statement of income  in accordance with us gaap 
historically  we have taken the approach of not hedging the above exposures  based on the notion that the cost of constantly hedging over the years would amount to more than the random impact of rate changes on our non us dollar balances 
for instance  an increase in the value of the swiss franc would be unfavorable to the earnings of the but would be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that the yearly translation gain or loss into us dollars is likely to move in the opposite direction 
in late  we began to expand our market making systems to incorporate cash forex and forex options in order to hedge our currency exposure at little or no cost 
in september  we began hedging our currency exposure throughout the day on a continuous basis 
in connection with the development of our currency hedging strategy  we have determined to base our net worth in globals 
we define global as consisting of a basket of major currencies that currently includes us dollar  euro  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar 
with the growth of our international operations  we foresee including other currencies in our definition of the global 
as our forex market making systems continue to develop  and as more exchanges trade more forex based products electronically  we expect more trading volume to flow through this system and  accordingly  we expect to be able to manage the risks in forex in the same low cost manner as we currently manage the risks of our market making in equity based products 
interest rate risk we had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  these debt obligations are subject to fluctuations in interest rates at the end of each borrowing term  which impact the amount of interest we must pay 
if the debt were to remain at this level and variable interest rates were to increase by per annum  the annual impact to our net income from debt obligations of this amount would be a reduction of million 
under our senior secured revolving credit facility  we have the ability to choose borrowing tenors from overnight to twelve months  which permits us to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
we pay our electronic brokerage customers interest based on benchmark overnight interest rates in various currencies 
in a normal rate environment  we typically invest a portion of these funds in us government treasury securities with maturities of up to three months 
under these circumstances  if interest rates were to increase rapidly and substantially  in increments that were not reflected in the yields on these treasury securities  our net interest income from customer deposits would decrease 
based upon investments outstanding at december   we had no exposure of this nature 
we also face the potential for reduced net interest income from customer deposits due to interest rate spread compression in a low rate environment 
a decrease of in benchmark interest rates below would reduce our net interest income by approximately million on an annualized basis 
we also face substantial interest rate risk due to positions carried in our market making business to the extent that long or short stock positions may have been established for future or forward dates on options or futures contracts and the value of such positions are impacted by interest rates 
we hedge such risks by entering into interest rate futures contracts 
to the extent that these futures positions do not perfectly hedge this interest rate risk  our trading gains may be adversely affected 
the amount of such risk cannot be quantified 
dividend risk we face dividend risk in our market making business as we derive significant revenues and incur significant expenses in the form of dividend income and expense  respectively  from our substantial inventory of equity securities  and must make significant payments in lieu of dividends on short positions in securities in our portfolio 
projected future dividends are an important component of pricing equity options and other derivatives  and incorrect projections may lead to trading losses 
the amount of these risks cannot be quantified 
margin credit we extend margin credit to our customers  which is subject to various regulatory requirements 
margin credit is collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
the risks associated with margin credit increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where collateral is concentrated and market movements occur 
during such times  customers who utilize margin credit and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of a liquidation 
we are also exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions  such as short sales of options and equities  that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital 
we expect this kind of exposure to increase with growth in our overall business 
because we indemnify and hold harmless our clearing firms from certain liabilities or claims  the use of margin credit and short sales may expose us to significant off balance sheet risk in the event that collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers fail to satisfy their obligations 
as of december   we had billion in margin credit extended to our customers 
the amount of risk to which we are exposed from the margin credit we extend to our customers and from short sale transactions by our customers is unlimited and not quantifiable as the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices 
our account level margin credit requirements meet or exceed those required by regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve 
as a matter of practice  we enforce real time margin compliance monitoring and liquidate customers positions if their equity falls below required margin requirements 
we have a comprehensive policy implemented in accordance with regulatory standards to assess and monitor the suitability of investors to engage in various trading activities 
to mitigate our risk  we also continuously monitor customer accounts to detect excessive concentration  large orders or positions  patterns of day trading and other activities that indicate increased risk to us 
our credit exposure is to a great extent mitigated by our policy of automatically evaluating each account throughout the trading day and closing out positions automatically for accounts that are found to be under margined 
while this methodology is effective in most situations  it may not be effective in situations where no liquid market exists for the relevant securities or commodities or where  for any reason  automatic liquidation for certain accounts has been disabled
