item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we provide intelligent robotics systems  the core of which are our motion controls systems  integrated vision guidance technology and application software  which are sold in combination with our own proprietary or third parties robot mechanisms 
our vision guidance technology is tightly integrated with our motion controls technology  and this is a key differentiator for adept 
in addition  we provide a full complement of robotics services and support for our customers 
through sales to system integrators  oem partners and end user companies  we sell our robotics systems and services into a few broad industries where we believe we can provide the best solutions for particular applications 
growth strategy our growth strategy focuses on a few specific industries where the use of automation is growing or is expected to grow over the long term and where we can provide significant product differentiation 
the industries we have selected are packaging  solar  medical and disk drive electronics 
currently  we are focusing the majority of our investments on the global packaging and solar markets  which we believe provide the greatest opportunity for us over the next few years 
additionally  we continue to focus our sales efforts on traditional markets  such as the german automotive electronics and industrial industries  where our products are well received and we believe that significant long term opportunity exists 
because much of the demand for our products in the last few years has come from europe  during fiscal we intensified our efforts to strengthen our operational and sales capabilities in this region 
while recent economic trends have resulted in decreased demand from the established european automotive industrial and emerging solar industries during fiscal  we believe europe will continue to be an important long term market for our products  both in traditional sectors such as automotive electronics and industrial  and in our target growth markets  including packaging and solar 
consequently  during fiscal we opted to preserve the operational and sales infrastructure that we had built up over the preceding quarters  despite restructuring activities and other cost cutting measures taken 
included in our growth strategy is an ongoing active search for possible merger and acquisition targets 
our focus is on pursuing business combinations that would broaden our solutions capabilities  further strengthen our position in key markets  increase our revenues and expand our operational scale 
trends in our business global recession and the escalation of economic uncertainty worldwide created a broader cautionary environment for us and for our customers during fiscal  which resulted in decreased demand or delayed orders for our products in nearly all markets and geographies 
one exception to this trend was in france  where demand for our quattro robot and other packaging solutions for the food  cosmetics and pharmaceuticals sectors increased during fiscal  resulting in a annual increase in french robotics sales 
the combination of our strategic focus on the packaging market and the ability of french manufacturers to continue their capital investments during this period of economic weakness also helped boost sales from the worldwide packaging market to of total revenue in fiscal  compared with of total revenue in fiscal sales in the us packaging market also remained relatively stable in fiscal another target market  medical  also increased as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared with the prior year 
we expect the increase in relative percentage of our revenues from sales into these target industries to continue in fiscal 
table of contents during fiscal  we experienced significantly decreased demand from the automotive electronics and industrial industries in germany  which traditionally have been relatively stable markets for us 
these traditional markets are a significant component of revenue for adept 
demand from the disk drive market in the us and asia remained weak during fiscal  with the exception of a large order received in the first quarter of the year 
additionally  sales to the worldwide solar market did not increase as we had anticipated  but actually decreased both in dollars and as a percent of revenue in fiscal  as solar cell manufacturers reduced both production and new capital investment in reaction to the global recession and lower end user demand 
cycles of investment and absorption are common in the solar manufacturing industry  and we believe that such cycles provide opportunity for manufacturers to revisit their automation requirements and plan for the integration of new solutions 
in general  we believe such cycles are beneficial to adept in the long term  as the additional time for evaluation makes it easier for customers to initiate significant changes in their automation programs 
in recent months  we have achieved new design wins with solar cell manufacturers that we believe will provide significant opportunity for adept  once these manufacturers begin to equip their automation environments and ramp up their production operations 
however  we believe sales to the solar market will continue to be constricted until the global economic environment strengthens  end user demand increases and the lending environment for capital purchases improves 
despite continued weakness in the global economy  we experienced modest sequential growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal we also had stronger and more stable order patterns among our customers in the fourth fiscal quarter and continued to achieve design wins within the solar segment  which we believe will translate into meaningful revenue growth once manufacturing spending increases 
during fiscal  we were impacted by the weakening of the euro against the us dollar  which resulted in a negative impact to our revenues  as approximately half of our sales are invoiced in euros but reported in us dollars 
we were also negatively affected by the strengthening of the japanese yen versus the us dollar as certain of our inventory is sourced from japan 
we expect that our revenues may continue to be adversely affected to the extent such trends in international currencies persist 
restructuring and cost reduction actions in response to economic uncertainty and the more cautious outlook of our customers  during fiscal we implemented a comprehensive restructuring program as part of an overall initiative to focus on generating cash flow while maintaining investment in our target markets 
beginning in the second quarter of  we began implementing restructuring actions designed to reduce our quarterly expenses by approximately million 
over the course of the year  we reduced headcount by approximately  implemented company wide salary reductions  including a reduction for our ceo and a reduction for our other executive officers  pay reductions for our employees in the us and singapore and a work share program in europe  phased out discontinued remanufactured robots in our services business and wrote off the associated inventory  wrote off remaining goodwill and intangibles associated with the acquisition of cerebellum  consolidated some facilities and certain operating functions  and outsourced additional non core activities 
these actions resulted in savings of million per quarter and were fully realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we expect that operating expense levels may increase slightly from fourth quarter levels  as we continue to invest in specific programs and opportunities to support our strategy for growth in the packaging and solar markets and  as our revenues and the market allows  restore base salary levels for our employees 

table of contents additionally  beginning in the third quarter of  we began to experience the benefit of cost reductions previously implemented in our quattro product that we expect will continue to positively impact gross margin going forward 
we remain committed to managing our business to generate cash 
this discussion summarizes significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flow during the two year period ended june   each year therein referred to as fiscal and  reflecting requirements applicable to adept as a smaller reporting company 
unless otherwise indicated  references to any year in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to our fiscal year ended june this discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and financial statement footnotes included in this annual report on form k 
product developments to better address the needs of the packaging and solar markets  in fiscal we introduced an important new robot to our portfolio  quattro  which offers industry leading speed and performance for high speed automation applications 
the quattro robot is a unique robot design licensed exclusively to adept and protected by patents in adept s key geographic markets 
over the last two years  quattro has grown to comprise a significant and increasing portion of our sales 
in may  we introduced a new inverted scara robot  the adept cobra s  to address applications in the packaging market such as mechanical assembly  material handling and packaging of packaged goods 
in november  we introduced two new robots for packaging automation  the adept cobra scara and the adept quattro s parallel robot 
at the same time  we also introduced and began selling a new packaging management software system  ace packxpert  designed for the rapid development and deployment of packaging applications 
currently  ace packxpert software is included with every quattro robot shipped for packaging applications  which further enhances and differentiates the capabilities of quattro in this target market 
acquisitions on january  the effective date  adept acquired percent of the outstanding common shares of cerebellum automation sas 
the results of cerebellum s operations have been included in adept s consolidated financial statements since that date 
cerebellum  based in france  is a provider of custom robotics and motion control products and components 
the initial purchase price paid at closing  excluding all items tied to retention compensation  totaled  this included an initial cash payment of  the assumption of accrued liabilities of  due within one year and direct acquisition costs of  the payment of additional contingent deferred cash consideration of  in cash and  payable in shares of adept common stock was paid on the first anniversary of the effective date provided that certain employees remain employed by cerebellum 
these amounts were amortized monthly through january  and paid on january  additional contingent consideration of  in cash and  payable in shares of adept common stock may be paid on the second anniversary of the acquisition in january  provided that certain employees remain employed by cerebellum  and will be amortized monthly during the second year following the acquisition months to 
additionally  there are contingent amounts payable up to a maximum aggregate amount of  in adept common stock based on cerebellum s meeting of certain revenue milestones in each of the first and second years after the effective date 
the first revenue milestone payment was paid in january in the amount of  representing of the total maximum amount payable on the first anniversary 
we have determined that contingent amounts payable on the second anniversary up to  in common stock related to revenue goals will not be met in the second year after the effective date 
the contingent payments were expensed instead of added to goodwill since the goodwill related to cerebellum was fully impaired in the fourth quarter of fiscal all common stock references as payments related to this acquisition are calculated based on the day average share price of adept prior to the anniversary of the effective date 

table of contents results of operations revenues the following table sets forth our annual revenues and year to year change in revenues by business segment for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenue by segment robotics revenues percentage of total revenues services and support revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues revenues were million in fiscal  down million  or  from million in fiscal the decline in total revenues resulted from sales decreases both in our robotics segment and our service and support segment  as both production activities and capital investment slowed as a result of the weak global economic environment 
robotics segment revenues were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal lower robotics revenues in fiscal were primarily the result of significantly reduced demand from the automotive electronics and industrial markets in germany  continued weak demand from the disk drive market in the us and asia  and decreased demand from the worldwide solar market 
in contrast  demand from our target packaging market increased in france during fiscal and remained stable in the us services and support segment revenues were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower demand for remanufactured robotics from disk drive and consumer electronics manufacturers in the us and asia  as well as lower demand from the automotive electronics and industrial markets in germany 

table of contents the following table sets forth our annual revenues and year to year change in revenues by geographic region for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenue by geography united states revenues percentage of total revenues europe revenues percentage of total revenues asia revenues percentage of total revenues other countries revenues percentage of total revenues total international revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues our us revenues were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal this decrease reflects reduced sales of both new robotic systems and refurbished robots to the disk drive and general industrial markets  partially offset by increased sales of our quattro robots and other solutions for applications in the packaging market 
our international revenues were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal lower international revenues primarily resulted from decreased sales in europe 
european sales fell  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of decreased demand from the automotive electronics and industrial markets in germany 
sales to european solar cell manufacturers also decreased during fiscal  as the worldwide solar market slowed capital spending in light of the global recession 
in france  however  sales rose in fiscal as a result of increased demand for solutions to address packaging applications such as food  cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 
sales in asia increased to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal this increase was due to the receipt of a large order for new robotic systems in the first quarter of fiscal  however  demand from the overall disk drive market continued to decline during the second half of fiscal sales to other countries fell to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal this decrease primarily occurred in regions where in the past we have experienced increasing demand for our packaging solutions  but which have become impacted by a weaker economic environment 
in canada  production was slowed at a large pharmaceutical packaging program and in south america  sales levels declined primarily as a result of currency trends discouraging capital investment 

table of contents gross margin 
the following table sets forth our gross margin and year to year change in gross margin by business segment for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenues gross margin gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin in fiscal was the result of several factors  including a less favorable product mix  primarily as a result of lower sales volumes in europe  unfavorable currency impact associated with lower european sales and the weakening of the euro against the us dollar  a decrease in our higher margin service business  and in the fourth quarter of  the write down of inventory related to decreased economic demand  and lower of cost or market adjustments related to remanufactured robots 
partly offsetting these factors was higher product margin for our quattro robot 
additionally  we recognized one time software license revenue that accounted for an incremental two percentage points of gross margin in fiscal that was not replicated in fiscal we expect that gross margin in future periods will normalize to approach historical levels with stabilization of order levels and increased sales of higher margin products but continue to be affected by currency trends  particularly regarding the value of the euro versus the us dollar 
we further expect that the level of inventory write downs recorded in fiscal will decrease in future periods as the economic environment improves 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our gross margin percentage from period to period due to changes in volume  changes in availability of components  changes in product configuration  increased price based competition  changes in sales mix of products and or changes in operating costs 
operating expenses research  development and engineering the following table sets forth our research  development and engineering expenses and year to year change in these expenses for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands expenses percentage of revenue research  development and engineering r d costs are expensed as incurred  with the exception of software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and up to the general release of the software products that are capitalized 
technological feasibility is demonstrated by the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over either two or three years  whichever term is the estimated life of the software product 
r d expenses in fiscal were million  or of revenues  an increase of from million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in r d expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily the result of the inclusion of a full year of incremental expenses from cerebellum  which adept 
table of contents acquired during the third quarter of  the inclusion of software development expenses that previously had been capitalized  and a first anniversary contingent payment related to our acquisition of cerebellum  partially offset by reduced headcount expenses as a result of fiscal restructuring activities 
we expect that fixed r d expenses will remain relatively stable on a quarterly basis in fiscal in comparison with the million recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of the restructuring and expense reduction actions implemented during fiscal adept s capitalization of software costs was  in fiscal and  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table sets forth our selling  general and administrative expenses and year to year change in these expenses for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands expenses percentage of revenue selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  professional fees arising from legal  auditing and other consulting services  as well as tradeshow participation and other marketing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues in fiscal  down from million  or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in sg a in fiscal compared with the prior year primarily resulted from reductions in headcount and salaries initiated during the second quarter and reduced amounts spent on advertising offset by increases of  in reserves for doubtful accounts taken in the second quarter of related mostly to two specifically identified accounts whose which have been negatively affected by the downturn in the economy causing cash constraints and delayed payments  million in lease dispute and settlement costs and associated legal fees  and  of expenses related to the relocation of our principal corporate offices 
we expect that fixed sg a expenses will increase slightly during fiscal quarters in from the fourth fiscal quarter expense of million but decrease compared to fiscal full year levels 
the quarterly increase is expected to happen in fiscal as we continue to invest in specific programs and opportunities to support our strategy for growth in the packaging and solar markets and as we restore prior salary levels for our employees as business conditions  and accordingly revenues  improve 
amortization 
amortization of intangible assets was  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal higher levels of amortization in fiscal resulted from a full year of amortization of additional intangible assets acquired with the purchase of cerebellum in the third quarter of fiscal impairment of goodwill and intangibles 
as required under sfas  adept evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets at least annually and we record a charge for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
on january   adept acquired all outstanding common shares of cerebellum 
of the  of acquired intangible assets  all was assigned to cerebellum s approflex software system  with an approximate useful life of three years 
at the end of fiscal the remaining amount of intangible assets and goodwill related to 
table of contents cerebellum was  and  respectively and  of acquired developed technology non related to cerebellum 
due to decreased demand for this product as a result of the economic decline  we wrote off the remaining balances related to this intangible asset and goodwill during fiscal therefore  we recorded an impairment of  during fiscal for remaining goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquisition of cerebellum 
stock compensation expense 
under the provisions of sfas r  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal and  in fiscal for our stock options  espp and restricted stock grants 
higher stock based compensation expense in the fiscal period reflects a higher level of expense related to accounting for restricted stock grants made to adept s executives in september and  related to accelerated vesting due to restructuring actions 
we did not record an income tax benefit for the stock based compensation expense in either period because of the extent of our net operating loss carry forwards 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our recognition of stock compensation expense 
restructuring charges 
we recorded million in net restructuring charges in related to restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter of and continued during the remainder of the fiscal year  as further described under restructuring and cost reduction actions in the overview above 
of this net amount  the majority related to  of employee severance amounts  the write down of inventory of million associated with the phase out of discontinued remanufactured robots in our services business and  related to expense associated with the acceleration of the unvested portion of a restricted stock grant for our former ceo pursuant to the terms of his separation agreement  partially offset by a reversal of lease termination expense of  in the first quarter of in fiscal  we recorded  in restructuring charges  primarily related to lease terminations 
operating income loss 
we recorded an operating loss of million in fiscal  compared with operating income of million in fiscal our operating loss in fiscal primarily resulted from lower revenues and gross margin compared with the prior year  higher expenses for restructuring and the impairment of goodwill  and continued investment in adept s business 
operating income in fiscal was the result of increased revenues and gross margin and lower operating expenses 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  was  in fiscal  compared with interest income of  in fiscal the decrease in interest income  net is due to a decline in our overall cash balance in fiscal compared to the previous year 
foreign currency transaction gain loss 
adept s foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operation accounts are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we recorded a loss on foreign currency transactions of  in fiscal  compared with a gain on foreign currency transactions of  in fiscal the foreign currency loss was primarily the result of unrealized losses from the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro related to the remeasurement of cash  intercompany debt and accounts receivable balances in our european subsidiaries 
the loss was also affected by the strengthening of the japanese yen versus the us dollar for inventory purchases sourced in japan 
the foreign currency gain resulted primarily from the settlement of previously considered permanent usd denominated inter company balances 
provision for income taxes 
adept reviews its provision for income tax expense quarterly based on the results of operations on a legal entity basis 
based on this review  when appropriate  adept will record income tax expense based on current year income or record a liability that reflects additional tax expense for tax return filings or tax audits conducted by each jurisdiction in which tax returns have been filed 
the tax expense adjustments may arise due to various factors including adjustments to legal entity profitability or different interpretations of statute and regulations of a taxing jurisdiction 
we recorded a provision for income taxes for fiscal of  as compared with a provision for taxes of  for fiscal in both periods  the tax provision is principally 
table of contents comprised of foreign tax expense and miscellaneous state alternative minimum taxes 
the federal tax expense for fiscal was an estimate of the federal alternative minimum tax that was adjusted when the fiscal tax return was filed in fiscal we have net operating losses that are sufficient to offset a significant portion of our domestic and potentially some portion of our foreign tax obligations  except when yearly net operating loss limitations exist for domestic and foreign jurisdictions that result in some tax expense 
backlog 
our product backlog related to continuing operations at june  was approximately million  compared with million at june  backlog is calculated based on orders that are expected to ship during the twelve months following each fiscal year end 
customers who have placed orders with delivery dates beyond twelve months from the end of the fiscal period are not included in backlog  and thus we expect a substantial amount of the backlog at june  to ship during fiscal because orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and in certain instances may be subject to cancellation without significant penalty to the customer  our backlog at any date may not be indicative of demand for our products or actual net revenues for any period in the future 
liquidity and capital resources changes in the company s liquidity during the years ended june  is primarily the net effect of funds used in operations  capital expenditures and principal payments on outstanding notes payable and capital leases 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at june  and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted from cash used in operations of million  including a net loss for the year ended june  of million 
this loss was partially offset by a net increase in cash items of  including a decrease of million in accounts receivable  a net change in inventories and other assets of million and a decrease of  in other long term liabilities partially offset by a decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
this loss also was partially offset by non cash items of million including million of software amortization  depreciation and loss on disposal of property and equipment  million of stock based compensation  million of goodwill and intangible assets impairment and amortization and  of deferred tax 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased during in fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities of million was attributable to our net income of million augmented by million of non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation 
in fiscal year  cash used in investing activities of  includes  of purchases of property and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property and  of capitalized software which began to be amortized during the year 
in fiscal year  cash provided by investing activities of  primarily reflects the redemption of short term investments of million  offset by the purchase of intangibles as part of our acquisition of cerebellum  as well as capital expenditures for computer hardware and software  including capitalized software development costs 
cash used in fiscal by financing activities of  includes  of payments on capital leases and loan payments   used for repurchases of common stock   used to pay taxes for stock surrendered by employees to satisfy tax obligations for restricted stock incentive plans and  received for employee stock incentive program and employee stock purchase plans 
cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal year  represent proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options of  in fiscal year offset by payments of  on capital leases in fiscal in fiscal  the adept board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to million of adept stock over an unspecified time period 
the timing and amount of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including the stock price  corporate and contractual and regulatory requirements  alternative investment opportunities and other market and economic conditions 
adept acquired  shares of common stock for  in fiscal the company has no obligation to purchase a specific amount of common stock 
table of contents under its program and  to preserve our liquidity  we do not currently anticipate acquiring our common stock in the near future 
if stock were acquired  adept expects that it would fund its purchases from its working capital 
on may   adept entered into a loan and security agreement and certain related agreements with silicon valley bank  or svb  for a revolving line of credit 
under the terms of the loan and security agreement  adept may borrow  in us dollars  amounts not to exceed the lesser of million  or of adept s eligible accounts receivable the revolving line borrowing base 
the criteria for determining eligible accounts receivable are specified in the loan and security agreement 
foreign accounts receivable are only considered eligible accounts receivable if they meet the same requirements as domestic accounts receivable and are accompanied by specified types of credit support acceptable to svb  or svb has an enforceable first priority security interest in or other lien on such accounts 
the loan and security agreement authorizes adept to enter into foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts with svb fx forward contracts up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of  adept also may use the revolving line for certain cash management services  and request that svb issue letters of credit to others for the company s account 
letters of credit payable in a foreign currency are subject to a reserve equal to of the us dollar equivalent of the face amount of such letters of credit the letter of credit reserve 
the aggregate amount available under the revolving line at any time is equal to the revolving line borrowing base minus the face amount of outstanding letters of credit  the letter of credit reserve  an amount equal to of the outstanding fx forward contracts  any amounts used for cash management services and the principal balance of all outstanding advances 
no amounts have been drawn down under the revolving line as of the date of this filing 
borrowings bear interest at an interest rate per annum equal to the greater of  or the prime rate announced from time to time by svb plus 
adept s ability to make borrowings under the revolving line is subject to ongoing conditions precedent that its representations and warranties set forth in the loan and security agreement are true  in all material respects  on the date on which adept requests the borrowing and on the funding date  and that svb determines  in its sole discretion  that there has not been any material impairment in adept s business  results of operation  financial condition  or the prospect of repayment of adept s obligations to svb  or any material adverse deviation from adept s most recent business plan submitted to svb 
pursuant to the loan and security agreement and related agreements  adept granted svb a security interest in substantially all of adept s assets  and pledged certain of its shares of certain wholly owned subsidiaries to svb 
certain adept subsidiaries also guarantied adept s obligations under the loan and security agreement  granted svb a security interest in substantially all of their respective assets  and pledged their shares of certain indirect  wholly owned adept subsidiaries 
the revolving line will mature on may   unless adept terminates it earlier upon written notice to svb 
adept must meet certain financial covenants during the term of the loan and security agreement 
adept is required to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of to the adjusted quick ratio is the ratio of adept s cash and cash equivalents held at svb and at any other banks that have entered into a control agreement with svb  plus adept s accounts receivable  to adept s current liabilities and certain consolidated debt obligations

adept also must remain in compliance with various other covenants during the term of the loan and security agreement 
for example  adept must maintain its primary operating deposit accounts with svb  and must cause all of its us customers to transmit payments to a lockbox account at svb 
svb will transfer amounts collected from customers in the lockbox account to adept s designated deposit account at svb  unless adept s adjusted quick ratio is below to  or there is any default under the loan and security agreement  in which case svb will first apply collections from the lockbox account toward repayment of adept s obligations to svb  and then transfer any excess to svb s designated deposit account 
adept may not permit or suffer any specified change in control  
table of contents including any change in the beneficial ownership of or more or or more  in the case of shares held by one specified major shareholder group of adept s outstanding shares  without svb s prior written consent 
various other covenants place restrictions on the manner in which adept conducts its business  adept s ability to pay dividends to stockholders  incur additional indebtedness or encumber its assets  the types of transactions including mergers and acquisitions adept may enter into and adept s ability to transfer funds to subsidiaries 
adept would be deemed to be in default under the loan and security agreement if adept failed to timely pay any amount owed to svb  if adept failed to comply with specified financial and other covenants  including those listed above  if adept otherwise materially breached  without cure  any of its representations under or other provisions in the loan documents  if there occurs a material adverse change in adept s or any guarantor subsidiary s business  operations or condition  or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of adept s obligations to svb  or a material impairment in the perfection or priority of svb s security interests or the value of svb s security interest in adept s or any guarantor subsidiary s assets  or if svb determines there is a reasonable likelihood that adept will not meet its financial covenants in the next succeeding quarter  if any involuntary lien or attachment is issued against adept s or any guarantor subsidiary s assets  or any judgment or order in excess of  is entered against adept or any guarantor subsidiary  that is not discharged  vacated or satisfied within ten days  if adept or any guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent or is generally not paying its debts as they become due  if adept or any guarantor subsidiary makes any material written misrepresentation to svb  if adept fails to pay amounts due under or otherwise materially breaches any agreements with third parties  or if a default occurs under such agreements which permits indebtedness in excess of  to be accelerated  if breaches occur under agreements related to subordinated debt that may be outstanding during the term of the loan  if there is any revocation or termination of  or nonperformance of any obligation or covenant under  any guaranty of adept s obligations  or if adept loses government approvals or becomes subject to certain governmental actions that could materially adversely affect adept in the manner specified in the agreement 
in the event of a default under the loan and security agreement  svb may  among other things  cease making loans to adept  accelerate and declare all or any part of adept s obligations to be immediately due and payable  and enforce its security interest against the collateral 
adept was in compliance with the covenants of the loan and security agreement as of june  adept paid a facility fee of  upon entering into the loan and security agreement  and will pay an additional facility fee of  on the first anniversary of the effective date or upon early termination of the loan and security agreement prior to such anniversary date 
adept will pay a fee  quarterly in arrears  equal to 
per annum of the average unused portion of the credit line amounts reserved for cash management services and an amount equal to of outstanding foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts being treated as unused portions of the line for this purpose 
during periods when there are outstanding balances of principal and interest under the revolving line  svb is entitled to charge a float charge  payable on the last calendar day of each month  in an amount equal to one extra day of interest on each payment received by svb from adept during the month 
adept will pay a collateral monitoring fee of per month if adept s adjusted quick ratio as defined above is less than to during the month  and there were outstanding balances of principal and interest or outstanding issued letters of credit during the month 
adept also will pay a letter of credit fee of per annum of the us dollar equivalent face amount of issued letters of credit  and all other bank fees and expenses related to the loan transaction 
we have not used our revolving line of credit since its inception 
however  based on operating needs  strategic planning and other factors  we may utilize the line of credit in the future 
see the discussion under the heading restructuring and cost reduction actions above which discusses adept s actions with respect to its reduction in operating expenses and anticipated trends for fiscal we believe that our future cash from operations together with our access to funds available under our revolving line of credit will provide adequate resources to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations is not required for adept as a smaller reporting company 

table of contents long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of fixed assets of million and million net of depreciation at june  and  respectively 
financial information regarding the geographic breakdown of our long lived assets is included in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
litigation from time to time  adept is subject to various other lawsuits and claims relating to issues such as contract disputes  product liability  and employee and other matters 
although the results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters  to the extent not previously provided for  will not have a material adverse effect  individually or in the aggregate  on the company s consolidated financial statements taken as a whole 
we have in the past received communications from third parties asserting that we have infringed certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others  or seeking indemnification against alleged infringement 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the likelihood or outcome of any actual or potential actions from such assertions against us  we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of adept s financial condition and results of operations are based upon adept s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to warranty obligations  bad debt  inventories  cancellation costs associated with long term commitments  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring expenses  service contracts  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates and judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and it is possible that such changes could occur in the near term 
reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to present the financial statements on a consistent basis with current year presentation 
such reclassifications have not changed previously reported net income loss or stockholders equity 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our consolidated financial statements while considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
these critical accounting policies described below include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  
table of contents warranties  capitalization of software development costs  accounting for income taxes  foreign currency accounting  long lived assets and goodwill  valuation of stock based awards  and commitments and contingencies 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from sales of production automation equipment and parts  and to a lesser extent from support and service activities associated with this equipment 
non software product revenue consists primarily of sales of robots  refurbished robots and spare parts 
we recognize non software product revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer  and when an economic exchange has taken place 
we use the signed purchase contract or purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
product revenues are normally recognized at the point of shipment from adept facilities since title and risk of loss passes to the customers at that time 
customers generally have no right of return other than for product defects covered by our warranty 
adept maintains a warranty liability based on our historical warranty experience and managements best estimate of adept s warranty liability at each balance sheet date 
there are no acceptance criteria on our standard non software products 
we do not deem the fee to be fixed or determinable where a significant portion of the price is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from the invoice date 
in recording revenue  management exercises judgment about the collectibility of receivables based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we conclude that collection is not reasonably assured  then the revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed  generally upon receipt of payment 
our experience is that we have been able to reliably determine whether collection is reasonably assured 
adept s robots and controllers have features that are enabled or enhanced through the use of software enabling tools and other software elements  which are embedded within our robot and controller products 
our software enabling tools or other software elements do not operate independently of the robots or controllers  and they are not sold separately and cannot be used without the robots or controllers 
we also sell optional software used to enhance capability of our products 
we believe that the software component of our products is incidental to our products and services taken as a whole 
we recognize software revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  and software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  iv collectibility is probable and v the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
license revenue is recognized on shipment of the product provided that no significant vendor or post contract support obligations remain and that collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable by management 
insignificant vendor and post contract support obligations are accrued upon shipment of the licensed product 
for software that is installed and integrated by the customer  revenue is recognized upon shipment assuming functionality has already been proven in prior sales and there are no customizations that would cause a substantial acceptance risk 

table of contents service and support revenue consists primarily of sales of spare parts and refurbished robots 
service revenue also includes training  consulting and customer support  the latter of which includes all field service activities  ie  maintenance  repairs  system modifications or upgrades 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized at the time the service is performed and the customer has accepted the work 
these revenues are not essential to the product functionality and  therefore  do not bear on the revenue recognition policy for adept s component products 
deferred revenues represent payments received from customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements enumerated above  as well as cases in which we have invoiced the customer but cannot yet recognize the revenue for the same reasons discussed above 
revenue for robot refurbishment relates to adept owned or customer owned remanufactured robots and components 
adept receives parts returned from customers under warranty contracts  or adept purchases surplus used parts available from customers or suppliers 
these parts traditionally have lower cost  and internal analysis indicates that on average  we pay a percentage of the new part cost to acquire these components 
the standard cost for acquired parts is therefore set at such percentage of cost in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  as reflected in sab  restructuring charges  impairments  and related issues  pronouncement requiring valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market 
by contrast  the cost basis starting point for customer owned remanufactured or repaired robots is zero since adept does not own the robots 
for all refurbishment and remanufacturing  we track all related costs and activities materials and labor required to bring the robots up to standard using work orders 
this revenue stream is included within our services and support segment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for doubtful accounts 
adept performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not generally request collateral from our customers 
however  adept may require customers to make payments in advance of shipment or provide a letter of credit under certain circumstances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our policy is to record specific allowances against known doubtful accounts 
an additional allowance is also calculated based on the greater of of consolidated accounts receivable or of consolidated accounts receivable more than days past due 
specific allowances are netted out of the respective receivable balances for purposes of calculating this additional allowance 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and  should the default rate change or the financial positions of our customers change  we may increase this additional allowance percentage 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or market value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes  among other factors  a review of component demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans  and quality issues 
as a result of this assessment  we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated liquidation value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
manufacturing inventory includes raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
the inventory valuation provisions are based on an excess and obsolete systems report  which captures all obsolete parts and products and all other inventory  which have quantities on hand in excess of one year s projected demand 
individual line item 
table of contents exceptions are identified for either inclusion or exclusion from the inventory valuation provision 
the materials control group and cost accounting function monitor the line item exceptions and make periodic adjustments as necessary 
warranties 
our warranty policy is included in our terms of sale  generally as a two year parts and one year labor limited warranty on most hardware and component products  and states that there are no rights of return  and that a refund may be made at adept s discretion  and only if there is an identified fault in the product and the customer has complied with adept s approved maintenance schedules and procedures  and the product has not been subject to abuse 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and costs per claim for repair or replacement 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our components suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service labor and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  service labor or delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
capitalization of software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we begin capitalizing software development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility  which is established upon the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
costs incurred prior to technological feasibility are charged to expense as incurred 
capitalization ceases when the product is considered available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs are amortized to costs of revenues over the estimated economic lives of the software products based on product life expectancy 
generally  estimated economic lives of the software products do not exceed three years 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 
our net deferred tax assets relate predominantly to our united states tax jurisdiction 
we currently maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
our us loss  among other considerations  provides negative evidence under sfas no 
and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
we adopted fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  on july  we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including related interest  is adequate 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents foreign currency accounting 
adept applies sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  with respect to our international operations  which include manufacturing  sales and service entities 
each of our non us operations uses its respective local currency as the functional currency 
our foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations accounts are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from transactions  including intercompany balances not considered to be a permanent investment  denominated in currencies other than an entity s functional currency are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we do not currently apply a hedging strategy against our currency positions as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
long lived assets and goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment with respect to future sales and production volumes  revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital use  foreign exchange rates and selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit 
an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the intangibles and goodwill were acquired and valued in the third quarter of fiscal we test our intangible assets annually unless there are indications during an interim period that such assets may have become impaired 
we use our judgment in assessing whether intangible assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities may signal that an intangible asset has become impaired 
valuation of stock based awards 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period of the individual equity instrument 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes calculation for option grants is based on historical volatility as options on our stock are not traded 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
commitments and contingencies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate potential commitments and contingencies based on their anticipated outcome 
if we determine  after consideration of all known facts and consultation with legal counsel  that a loss related to the potential matter is neither probable or cannot be reasonably estimated as of the date of issuance of our fiscal period end reports  we do not accrue for the potential liability 
if a loss is reasonably possible related to the matter  we will disclose the relevant facts of the matter along with an estimated loss amount or range if such amount or range can be reasonably estimated 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of certain other recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition
