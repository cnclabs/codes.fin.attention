overview stereotaxis designs  manufactures and markets an advanced cardiology instrument control system for use in a hospital s interventional surgical suite to enhance the treatment of arrhythmias and coronary artery disease 
the niobe system is designed to enable physicians to complete more complex interventional procedures by providing image guided delivery of catheters and guidewires through the blood vessels and chambers of the heart to treatment sites 
this is achieved using externally applied magnetic fields that govern the motion of the working tip of the catheter or guidewire  resulting in improved navigation  efficient procedures and reduced x ray exposure 
the core components of the niobe system have received regulatory clearance in the us  canada europe  china and various other countries 
we believe that our system represents a revolutionary technology in the interventional surgical suite  or interventional lab  and has the potential to become the standard of care for a broad range of complex cardiology procedures 
we also believe that our system is the only technology to be commercialized that allows remote  computerized control of catheters and guidewires directly at their working tip 
we also believe that our technology represents an important advance in the ongoing trend toward digital instrumentation in the interventional lab and provides substantial  clinically important improvements and cost efficiencies over manual interventional methods  which require years of physician training and often result in long and unpredictable procedure times and sub optimal therapeutic outcomes 
in addition to the niobe system and its components  stereotaxis also has developed the odyssey total information solution  which consolidates the multiple sources of diagnostic and imaging information found in the interventional lab into a large screen user interface with single mouse control  which can be connected via a private network line to other interventional labs or to a remote clinical call center 
the system also features a remote viewing and recording capability  called odyssey cinema  that simultaneously captures procedure data from multiple sources 
the tool includes an archiving capability that will allow clinicians to store and replay entire procedures or segments of procedures 
this information can be accessed from locations throughout the hospital local area network and over the global odyssey network providing physicians with a tool for clinical collaboration  remote consultation and training 
the odyssey total information solution may be acquired in conjunction with a niobe system or on a stand alone basis for installation in interventional labs and other 
table of contents locations where clinicians often desire the benefits of odyssey s consolidated large screen single mouse control  and potential real time access to networked call center support that we believe can improve clinical workflows and related efficiencies 
from its inception in  the company s initial focus was on the development of neurosurgical applications for our technology  including delivery of devices to specific sites within the brain 
during that time  we primarily devoted our resources to developing prototypes and performing research and development activities in this area 
following receipt of fda approval to begin human clinical trials in the field of brain biopsies  we successfully completed our initial human clinical procedures in this area in late over the next two years  we shifted our primary focus to developing applications for our technology to treat cardiovascular diseases because of the significantly larger market opportunities for these applications 
during  following receipt of marketing clearance from the fda for our current system  we emerged from the development stage and began to generate revenue from the placement of investigational systems and the commercial launch of our cardiology system in the us and europe 
in august  we completed an initial public offering in which we issued and sold  shares of our common stock  including the overallotment  at per share  raising approximately million in net proceeds 
in february  we completed an underwritten take down of our common stock from our shelf registration in which we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at per share including the underwriters overallotment option  raising approximately million in net proceeds 
in march  we completed an offering of  shares of our common stock at per share  receiving approximately million in net proceeds 
in december we completed two concurrent registered direct offerings of our common stock 
in one of the offerings  affiliates of two members of our board of directors purchased a total of  shares of our common stock at per share including warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share exercisable through june in the other offering  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share including warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at per share exercisable through june and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at per share with an expiration date in june in addition  in the second offering  we issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock which are exerciseable under certain defined conditions at an exercise price of per share through may the investors in this transaction became entitled to exercise and did exercise  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in march in conjunction with these transactions  we received approximately million in net proceeds after deducting offering expenses 
we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of the niobe and odyssey systems as well as recurring revenue from the sale of our proprietary disposable devices  from ongoing license and service contracts  and from royalties paid to the company on the sale by biosense webster of co partnered catheters 
we market our products to a broad base of hospitals in the united states and internationally as detailed in note to the financial statements 
due to an increase in our installed base and to the introduction and regulatory approval of a broader range of catheters and guidewires for use with the niobe system  recurring revenue has increased from of total revenues in to in and in we expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional losses into as we continue the development and commercialization of our products  conduct our research and development activities and advance new products into clinical development from our existing research programs and fund our sales and marketing initiatives 
our goal is to achieve break even in our quarterly operating earnings at a quarterly revenue level of less than million 

table of contents we have alliances with each of siemens ag medical solutions  philips medical systems and biosense webster  inc  through which we integrate our niobe system with market leading digital imaging and d catheter location sensing technology  as well as disposable interventional devices  in order to continue to develop new solutions in the interventional lab 
each of these alliances provides for coordination of our sales and marketing activities with those of our partners 
in addition  siemens is our product distributor in certain countries and has agreed to provide worldwide service for our integrated systems 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements 
revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the total revenue to each deliverable based on the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and recognize revenue for each separate element as the criteria are met 
under eitf  we are required to continually evaluate whether we have separate units of accounting for deliverables within certain contractual arrangements we have made with customers  specifically as it relates to the sale and installation of our magnetic navigation system 
prior to the quarter ended june   we had met the first criterion for separation of multiple elements under eitf  which was that the niobe system has stand alone value but had not yet accumulated sufficient evidence to support the determination of fair value on the undelivered installation element 
by the second quarter of  we had accumulated sufficient experience to conclude that installation had been and could be performed by several independent vendors such that fair value could be determined 
as such  we determined in the second quarter of that installation met the criteria under sab and eitf issue no 
for recognition as a separate element or unit of accounting and began to recognize revenue on the delivery and installation of the niobe system as two separate elements 
as of december   revenue is recognized on the sale of the odyssey system upon completion of installation 
under our revenue recognition policy  revenue for niobe system sales is recognized for the portion of sales price due upon delivery  provided that delivery has occurred  title has passed  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the greater of the fair market value or the amount of the sales price due upon installation is recognized as revenue when the standard installation process is complete 
when installation is the responsibility of the customer  revenue from system sales is recognized upon shipment since these arrangements do not include an installation element or right of return privileges 
we may deliver systems to a non hospital site at the customer s request 
we evaluate whether delivery has occurred considering the guidance under sab with respect to bill and hold 
revenue is recognized for odyssey systems upon completion of installation 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
revenue from services and license fees  whether sold individually or as a separate unit of accounting in a multi element arrangement  is deferred and amortized over the service or license fee period  which is typically one year 
revenue from services is derived primarily from the sale of annual product maintenance plans 
we recognize revenue from disposable device sales or accessories upon shipment and establish an appropriate reserve for returns 
the return reserve  which is applicable only to disposable devices  is 
table of contents estimated based on historical experience which is periodically reviewed and updated as necessary 
in the past  changes in estimate have had only a de minimus affect on revenue recognized in the period 
we believe that the estimate is not likely to change significantly in the future 
stock based compensation stock compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  results from stock option and stock appreciation rights grants made to employees  directors and consultants at the fair value of the option granted  from grants of restricted shares to employees and from share purchases by employees under our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted was determined using the black scholes valuation method which gives consideration to the estimated value of the underlying stock at the date of grant  the exercise price of the option  the expected dividend yield and volatility of the underlying stock  the expected life of the option and the corresponding risk free interest rate 
the fair value of the grants of restricted shares  all of which were granted after we became a public company  was determined based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant 
stock compensation expense for options  stock appreciation rights and for time based restricted share grants is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying issue  generally over four years except for grants to directors which generally vest over one to two years 
stock compensation expense for performance based restricted shares is amortized on a straight line basis over the anticipated vesting period and is subject to adjustment based on the actual achievement of objectives 
compensation expenses related to option grants to non employees is periodically remeasured through the vesting date 
compensation expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest  net of estimated forfeitures 
estimates of the expected life of options has been based on the average of the vesting and expiration periods  the simplified method under sfas r 
estimates of volatility and forfeiture rates utilized in calculating stock based compensation have been prepared based on historical data and future expectations and actual experience to date has been consistent with these estimates 
the amount of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may increase if we make additional grants of options  stock appreciation rights or restricted shares or if employees continue to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan or if we determine that actual forfeiture rates are less than anticipated 
the amount of expense to be recorded in future periods may decrease if we do not achieve the performance objectives by which certain restricted shares are contingent  if the requisite service periods are not completed or if the actual forfeiture rates are greater than anticipated 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of our inventory  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or its current estimated market value 
we periodically review our physical inventory for excess  obsolete items and potential impaired items and reserve accordingly 
our reserve estimate for excess and obsolete is based on expected future use 
our reserve estimates have historically been consistent with our actual experience as evidenced by actual disposal of the goods 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we have established a valuation allowance against the entire amount of our deferred tax assets because we are not able to conclude  due to our history of operating losses  that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize any portion of the deferred tax assets 
in assessing whether and to what extent deferred tax assets are realizable  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of 
table of contents deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable losses  limitations imposed by section of the internal revenue code and projections for future losses over periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we determined that a valuation allowance of deferred tax assets was appropriate

interest expense decreased approximately to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased primarily due to the amortization of commitment fees related to the line of credit received from affiliates of certain members of our board of directors impacting the year 
income taxes realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by valuation allowances as of december   and to reflect these uncertainties 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million of which approximately million will expire between and and approximately million will expire between and as of december   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which will expire at various dates between and if not utilized 
we may not be able to utilize certain of these loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
liquidity and capital resources in february  we completed an underwritten take down of our common stock from our shelf registration in which we issued and sold  shares of our common stock  including overallotment  at per share  receiving approximately million in net proceeds 
in august  we filed a universal shelf registration statement for the issuance and sale from time to time to the public of up to million in securities  including debt  preferred stock  common stock and warrants 
in march we sold approximately million shares under this shelf registration in a registered direct offering  raising approximately million 
we used the remaining available amount under this shelf registration in the two registered direct offerings completed in december  as described below 
in february we entered into a loan and warrant purchase agreement with current stockholders who are affiliates of two members of our board of directors  providing for a million commitment of funds to be provided either as direct loans to us or as a guarantee of amounts borrowed by us under our working capital facility with our primary lending bank 
in connection with this transaction  in march we amended our loan agreement with our primary lender to increase availability under the working capital line to million subject to qualifying receivable and inventory balance limitations  including up to million to be secured by guarantees from such stockholders  and to extend the maturity of the line to march  under the revised facility we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the agreement

in november  the stockholders described above committed to extend their february agreement to loan us an aggregate of million on an unsecured basis 
as amended  the commitment will expire on the earlier of march  or the date we receive at least million of third party  non bank financing 
this facility may also be used by us to guarantee the loan commitments of our primary bank lender  through the same extended term 
in february we issued the stockholders warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share in exchange for the extension of the commitment

in march  we entered into an agreement with our primary lending bank to amend the revolving line of credit to provide for million in total capacity  including million to be supported by guarantees from stockholders who are affiliates of two members of our board of directors 
the revolving line expires on march   contains tangible net worth measurements and provides for availability based outstanding accounts receivable balances and inventory  subject to certain limitations 
liquidity refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near term obligations 
these liquid financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents  as well as short term investments 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances  we maintained million of investments in commercial paper and auction rate securities at december  we had no short term investments at december  
table of contents the following table summarizes our cash flow by operating  investing and financing activities for each of years ended december   and in thousands cash flow used in operating activities cash flow provided by used in investing activities cash flow provided by financing activities net cash used in operating activities 
we used approximately million  million and million of cash in operating activities during the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily as a result of operating losses during these periods 
cash generated from operating assets and liabilities increased to million during the year ended december  from million generated during the year ended december  primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash provided by used in investing activities 
we generated approximately million of cash from investing activities during the year ended december  compared to million provided by investing activities during the year ended december  and million used during the year ended december  the cash generated from and investing activities was substantially from the sale of investments 
the cash used for investing activities was principally for the purchase of investments 
we used million during the year ended december  for the purchase of property and equipment compared to million and million respectively in and net cash provided by financing activities 
we realized approximately million from financing activities during the year ended december  principally from the borrowings under our line of credit and our agreement with biosense as described above 
in addition  we realized approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock during the year ended december  we realized approximately million from financing activities during the year ended december  principally from the sale of our common stock in which we realized approximately million in net proceeds and from a million borrowing under our line of credit

as of december   we had million outstanding under the revolving line of credit and had an unused line of approximately million with current borrowing capacity of million  including amounts already drawn 
as such  we had the ability to borrow an additional million under the revolving line of credit at december  as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants of the bank loan agreement 
these credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreements include customary affirmative  negative and financial covenants 
for example  we are restricted from incurring additional debt  disposing of or pledging our assets  entering into merger or acquisition agreements  making certain investments  allowing fundamental changes to our business  ownership  management or business locations  and from making certain payments in respect of stock or other ownership interests  such as dividends and stock repurchases 
under our loan arrangements  as in effect at december  and as modified in march  we are required to maintain various levels of tangible net worth as defined in the loan agreement 
we are also required under the credit agreements to maintain our primary operating account and the majority of our cash and investment balances in accounts with the lender 
as of december  and as of the amendment date we were in compliance with all covenants of this agreement 

table of contents we expect to have negative cash flow from operations into throughout  we expect to continue the development and commercialization of our existing products and  to a lesser extent  our research and development programs and the advancement of new products into clinical development 
we expect that our research and development expenditures will decrease in and our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in order to support our product commercialization efforts 
until we can generate significant cash flow from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of our public offerings  private sales of our equity securities and working capital and equipment financing loans 
in the future  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financings 
we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our utilization of capital  which will depend on a number of factors outside of our control 
while we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements through the next months  we cannot assure that we will not require additional financing before that time 
we also cannot assure that such additional financing will be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us or at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available to us  we could be required to delay development or commercialization of new products  to license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize ourselves or to reduce the sales  marketing  customer support or other resources devoted to our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes all significant contractual payment obligations by payment due date payments by period contractual obligations under year years years over years total in thousands long term debt operating leases capital leases total we have not included interest payable on our term notes or our revolving credit agreement in these amounts because the interest on these obligations is calculated at a variable rate 
commercial commitments we have entered into a letter of credit to support certain commitments in the amount of approximately million which expires in december 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we operate mainly in the us  europe and asia and we expect to continue to sell our products both within and outside of the us although the majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us dollars  a portion of our operations are conducted in euros and to a lesser extent  in other currencies 
as such  we have foreign exchange exposure with respect to non us dollar revenues and expenses as well as cash balances  accounts receivable and accounts payable balances denominated in non us dollar currencies 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
future fluctuations in the value of these currencies may affect the price competitiveness of our products 
in addition  because we have a relatively long installation cycle for our systems  we will be subject to risk of currency fluctuations between the time we execute a purchase order and the time we deliver the system and collect payments under the order  which could adversely affect our operating margins 
as of december  we have not hedged exposures in foreign currencies or entered into any other derivative instruments 
for the year ended december   sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately of total revenue 
for the year ended december   our revenue would have decreased by approximately million if the us dollar exchange rate used would have strengthened by 
for the year ended december   expenses denominated in foreign currencies were approximately of our total expenses 
for the year ended december   our operating expenses would have decreased by approximately million if the us dollar exchange rate used would have strengthened by 
in addition  we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which we have exposure at december  would not have materially affected the carrying amounts of those net assets 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing the risk of loss 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term debt instruments 
we invest our excess cash primarily in us government securities and marketable debt securities of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings
