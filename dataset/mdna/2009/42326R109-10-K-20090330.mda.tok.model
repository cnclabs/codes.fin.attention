the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements which are included in item of part ii of this form k 
business overview helicos biosciences corporation is a life sciences company focused on innovative genetic analysis technologies for the research  drug discovery and clinical diagnostics markets 
our products are based on our proprietary true single molecule sequencing tsms technology which enables rapid analysis of large quantities of genetic material by directly sequencing single molecules of dna or single dna copies of rna 
this approach differs from current methods of sequencing dna because it analyzes 
table of contents individual molecules of dna directly instead of analyzing a large number of copies of the molecule produced through complex sample preparation techniques 
our tsms technology eliminates the need for costly  labor intensive and time consuming sample preparation techniques  such as amplification or cloning  which are required by other methods to produce a sufficient quantity of genetic material for analysis 
we believe that our tsms technology will represent the first comprehensive and universal solution for single molecule genetic analysis and that its adoption can expand the market for genetic analysis while substantially lowering the cost of individual analyses 
our goal is to enable production level genetic analysis on an unprecedented scale by providing scientists and clinicians with the ability to compare genes and genomes from thousands of individuals 
if our tsms based products are successful  the information generated from using these products may lead to improved drug therapies  personalized medical treatments and more accurate diagnostics for cancer and other diseases 
our helicos genetic analysis platform is designed to obtain sequencing information by repetitively performing a cycle of biochemical reactions on individual dna molecules and imaging the results after each cycle 
the platform consists of an instrument called the heliscope single molecule sequencer  an image analysis computer tower called the heliscope analysis engine  associated reagents  which are chemicals used in the sequencing process  and disposable supplies 
the imaging capability of the heliscope sequencer is designed to accommodate performance beyond what is needed to meet the platform s initial goals  providing the flexibility to introduce substantial throughput and cost improvements in the future without major changes to or replacement of the instrument 
we believe that the helicos genetic analysis platform will ultimately enable the automated  parallel sequencing of billions of individual dna molecules at orders of magnitude of greater speed and lower cost than other sequencing systems 
we shipped our first two helicos systems in  one of which was ultimately returned 
we believe that we have incurred the substantial majority of the costs related to the development of the initial version of our helicos system 
in anticipation of future orders  shipments and placements  we are assembling and are testing multiple production units of our helicos system 
these future shipments of the helicos systems will be subject to various customer evaluation periods with acceptance criteria  and we expect the customer evaluation period to extend beyond the fiscal quarters in which commercial units are shipped 
we continue to secure orders for the helicos system and expect to recognize revenue from one of our initial instrument shipments in future revenues from sales of our instruments  proprietary reagents and disposable supplies will depend on individual customer agreements  timing of the installation and turnover to customer  customers use of the system and our ability to maintain our proprietary position on the reagents and disposable supplies 
because we have limited experience in the commercialization of our helicos system  we cannot predict the percentage of our revenues that we will derive from sales of proprietary reagents and disposable supplies 
however  over time we would expect the sales of the reagents and disposable supplies to increase as our installed base of instruments grows and usage of these instruments increases 
in december  we raised approximately million  after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses  through the issuance of  units  each unit consisting of i one share of common stock and ii one warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for a purchase price of per unit 
as of december   we had million in cash 
we believe that our existing cash and interest income we expect to earn on invested cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first quarter of we expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next two years  and will need additional financing to support our activities 
we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources  such as collaborations and licensing arrangements or partnerships 
the worldwide financial markets are currently experiencing turmoil 
these events have materially and 
table of contents adversely impacted the availability of financing to a wide variety of companies  particularly early stage companies such as helicos 
we do not know whether the additional capital which we will require will be available when and as needed  on favorable terms if at all  or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue business strategies 
in december  we implemented a reduction in the company s workforce and took other measures to reduce our future operating costs 
if our current operating plan including forecasted sales in does not materialize or if adequate additional funds are not available to us when required  we will be required to further delay  reduce or eliminate research and development programs  reduce or eliminate commercialization efforts  obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others on terms unfavorable to us  or pursue merger or divestiture strategies 
we were incorporated in delaware in may under the name rareevent medical corporation  renamed newco ls  inc in september and ultimately renamed helicos biosciences corporation in november our activities to date have consisted primarily of conducting research and development 
accordingly  we are considered to be in the development stage at december   as defined by the financial accounting standards board fasb in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises 
our fiscal year ends on december  and we operate as one reportable segment 
our corporate offices are located at one kendall square  building  cambridge  massachusetts financial overview grant revenue in september  we were awarded a grant from the national human genome research institute  a branch of the national institutes of health  pursuant to which we are eligible to receive reimbursement of our research expenses of up to million through august we recognized revenue during the years ended december  and of  and  respectively  in connection with this award 
we will continue to recognize revenue under this grant as the related expenses are incurred 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs associated with scientific research activities  and engineering development efforts 
such costs primarily include salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  lab and engineering supplies  investment in equipment  consulting fees  and facility related costs  including rent and depreciation 
during the year ended december   research and development expenses also included labor and overhead costs associated with the under utilization of the manufacturing facility  as well as a write off of excess and obsolete inventory 
during  we were focused on preparing for the launch of the initial version of the helicos genetic analysis system 
substantially all research and development expenses since our inception have been in connection with this project and we believe that we have incurred the substantial majority of the development costs associated with the commercial launch of the first generation of the helicos 
table of contents system through december however  additional costs were incurred during to both maintain and enhance the initial version of the helicos system in addition to development of new and different genetic analysis assays which will extend the capability of the initial version 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
while research and development expenses decreased only slightly from to  we experienced a shift in the focus of our activities during to manufacturing activities 
in addition to our ongoing research and development efforts  we have incurred start up manufacturing costs related to the assembly  testing and performance validation of the helicos system 
these costs were accounted for as research and development expenses in our pre commercialization phase as we prepared to ship the first helicos system  which occurred on march  we reached technological feasibility of the helicos system in december and  as a result  we began to record the cost of the helicos system in inventory 
we believe that the helicos system can potentially access a wide range of genetic analysis tests useful to the basic  pharmaceutical  and biomedical research and diagnostic markets 
in addition  we have envisioned a series of performance enhancements to the chemistries and consumables used on the initial helicos system which potentially serve to greatly enhance the sequencing throughput 
each of these research and development projects is dependent upon achieving technical objectives  which are inherently uncertain 
as a result of these uncertainties  we are unable to predict to what extent we will receive additional cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of these future tests or from the future enhanced throughput 
our inability to complete these new research and development projects in a timely manner would significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  consulting and professional fees  including patent related costs  general corporate costs and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses or cost of product revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
prior to the reduction in force  we expanded our sales and marketing functions during and incurred additional expenses for the costs associated with erp system enhancements  public company expenses  investor relations programs  and sarbanes oxley compliance 
restructuring in december  we implemented a work force reduction plan that resulted in the reduction of approximately of our workforce the reduction in force plan 
the reduction in force plan was designed to reduce our operating costs and direct our resources to continue advancing towards our near term goals 
employees directly affected by the reduction in force plan were provided with severance payments and outplacement assistance 
we incurred restructuring charges relating to one time termination benefits of approximately  in the fourth quarter of these charges represent employee severance and termination costs which were paid out during the fourth quarter of and will continue into the first quarter of 
table of contents we estimate that this restructuring will result in annual cost savings of approximately million  including salaries and benefits 
a summary of restructuring activity at december  is as follows year ended december  in thousands charge payments settlements current liability at december  employee severance  benefits and related costs research and development selling  general and administrative total results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  grant revenue

product revenue 
we recognized  of product revenue during the year ended december  product revenue recognized during the year ended december  related to the sale of proprietary reagents to a customer 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses during the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  in thousands change research and development research and development expenses decreased by  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the million decrease in product development costs  which included lab expenses  materials  supplies  temporary help and prototype expenses 
our product development costs decreased as we moved toward manufacturing and production activities 
prior to reaching technological feasibility  our start up manufacturing costs  such as those relating to the assembly  testing and performance validation of the helicos system  were expensed to research and development expense as the costs were incurred 
when management determined that the helicos system was ready for commercial launch in december  we began capitalizing our manufacturing costs to inventory 
the overall decrease was offset by a million charge for labor and overhead costs associated with the under utilization of the manufacturing facility  as well as a million write off for excess and obsolete inventory 
in addition  our salary and benefit expenses increased by million and our stock based compensation expense increased by  due primarily to the hiring of additional personnel to support the manufacturing and production activity 
the salary and benefit expense increase includes  related to the reduction in force plan implemented in december additionally  
table of contents occupancy costs increased by million due to the build out of our reagents consumables manufacturing infrastructure and a data center for our bioinformatics and computational biology efforts 
after implementing the reduction in force plan  we expect our research and development expenses to decline in however  as we gain commercial traction we will need to invest in future versions of our system 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  in thousands change selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel  which led to a million increase in our salary and benefit expenses and an  increase in our stock based compensation expense 
the salary increase includes  related to the reduction in force plan implemented in december certain legal expenses increased by  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  primarily as a result of an increase in costs associated with our intellectual property portfolio 
the increase also included an additional  related to public company activities  including investor relations expenses  business insurance and consulting fees 
in addition  increased headcount prior to the reduction in force plan led to additional space requirements which raised our occupancy costs by  from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  after our reduction in force plan  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease 
however  as we gain commercial traction we will need to expand our sales and marketing functions 
interest income 
interest income for the years ended december  and was as follows year ended december  in thousands change interest income the decrease in interest income from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to higher cash balances during the year ended december  in connection with the receipt of proceeds from the initial public offering ipo

interest income 
interest income for the years ended december  and was as follows year ended december  in thousands change interest income the increase in interest income from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to higher cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  in connection with the receipt of proceeds from the ipo 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december   respectively 
the interest expense was related to interest paid on a term loan under a line of credit facility and security agreement entered into in june  and interest expense related to the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants that were issued in connection with the line of credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred losses since our inception in may and  as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements to date  we have shipped two helicos genetic analysis systems  one of which was returned  and have not achieved profitability 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for at least two years as we continue our efforts in commercializing the helicos system and develop the corporate infrastructure required to manufacture and sell our products 
we continue to secure orders for the helicos system  and we expect to generate instrument revenue in as of december   we had million in cash 
we believe that our existing cash and interest income we expect to earn on invested cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first quarter of at some point prior to the end of the first quarter of  we expect that we will need additional financing to support our activities 
we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources  such as collaborations and licensing arrangements or partnerships 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred or debt securities  these securities would have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  given the current economic turmoil and restricted access to capital markets 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue business strategies 
in december  we implemented a reduction in the company s workforce and took other measures to reduce our future operating costs 
if our current operating plan including forecasted sales in does not materialize or if adequate additional funds are not available to us when required  we will be required to further delay  reduce or eliminate research and development programs  reduce or eliminate commercialization efforts  obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others on terms unfavorable to us  or pursue merger or divestiture strategies 

table of contents our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  the costs to complete development of products and the cost to commercialize our future products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this report 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of our future products and successfully deliver any such products to the market 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the following the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization activities  the success of our research and development efforts  the expenses we incur in marketing and selling our products  the revenue generated by future sales of our products  the timeliness of payments from our customers  the emergence of competing or complementary technological developments  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing or other arrangements that we may establish  and the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our outstanding obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases long term debt including interest license agreements total consists of fixed payments that we believe we are reasonably likely to make under the license agreements over the lives of the underlying existing patents 

table of contents the table above does not include possible royalties payable under our license agreements 
our commitments for operating leases relate to the lease for our corporate headquarters in cambridge  massachusetts 
license agreements and patents we have fixed annual costs associated with license agreements into which we have entered 
in addition  we may have to make contingent payments in the future upon realization of certain milestones or royalties payable under these agreements 
line of credit facility and security agreement in june  we entered into a line of credit facility and security agreement with general electric capital corporation ge capital 
the credit facility provided that we may borrow up to million at an interest rate based on the federal reserve s three year treasury constant maturities rate 
the advance period ended on december  the proceeds of the credit facility may be used for the purchase of equipment and are collateralized by specific equipment assets 
payments are required to be made on a monthly basis 
for the first six months interest only payments were required 
thereafter  for the following months  payments of principal and interest will be due for each advance 
the outstanding balance is collateralized by the equipment purchased with the proceeds from each equipment advance 
as of december   advances on the credit facility were million at a weighted average interest rate of 
loan and security agreement in december  we entered into a loan and security agreement with two lenders including ge capital corporation  which is serving as agent 
the loan agreement provided that we may borrow up to million at an interest rate equal to the sum of i the greater of a an interest rate based on the federal reserve s three year treasury constant maturities rate and b plus ii 
the initial term loan was made on the closing date in an aggregate principal amount equal to million 
in june  we entered into an amendment to the loan and security agreement with two lenders including ge capital corporation 
a subsequent term loan was made upon execution of the amendment in an aggregate principal amount equal to million 
the loan amendment provided that the interest rate for the subsequent term loan is equal to the sum of i the greater of a an interest rate based on the federal reserve s three year treasury constant maturities rate and b plus ii 
the loan agreement  as amended  contained affirmative and negative covenants to which we and our subsidiaries were required to adhere 
pursuant to the amendment  we were required to maintain  at all times  unrestricted cash in our bank account equal to at least million 
the borrowings under the loan agreement were collateralized by essentially all of our assets 
payments are required to be made on a monthly basis 
for the initial term loan  interest only payments were required for the first five months 
thereafter  for the following months  payments of principal and interest will be due 
for the subsequent term loan  principal and interest payments are required for the month term of the loan 
in connection with the execution of the june amendment to the loan and security agreement with two lenders including ge capital corporation  we issued warrants to the two lenders to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in june the fair value of the warrants was estimated at  using a black scholes model with the following assumptions expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of  expected life of six years and no dividends 
expected volatility was based on the volatility of similar entities in the life sciences industry of comparable size of market capitalization and financial 
table of contents position that completed initial public offerings within the last ten years 
the fair value of the warrants was recorded as equity and a debt discount and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan 
in december  we entered into an additional amendment to the loan and security agreement with certain lenders including ge capital corporation 
the amendment amended the prepayment provisions of the loan and security agreement to allow us to make a prepayment of million the pay down amount without incurring any prepayment penalties 
pursuant to the amendment  we made a prepayment  equal to the pay down amount  before december  in connection with such prepayment  and in lieu of the final payment fee with respect to the pay down amount  the amendment provides that we will pay a fee equal to of the initial million term loan  payable on the earlier of a january  and b the maturity date for the subsequent term loan 
the amendment further provides that our obligations under the loan agreement  as amended  are no longer secured by a cash amount of million 
as such  this amount in no longer classified as restricted cash as of december  such obligations continue to be secured under various collateral documents by interests in substantially all of our personal property  including the pledge of the stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  and proceeds of any intellectual property  but not by our intellectual property 
as of december   advances on the loan agreement  as amended  were million at an interest rate of 
as of december  and  the outstanding balance on the loan agreement was million and million  respectively 
private placement in public equity offering in december  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors pursuant to which we sold a total of  units the units  each unit consisting of i one share of common stock collectively  the shares and ii one warrant collectively  the warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for a purchase price of per unit representing the closing bid price plus an additional amount for the warrants the offering 
the warrants have a five year term and became exercisable immediately following the closing of the transaction 
the closing of the transaction occurred on december  in connection with the offering  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds 
we paid  in placement agent fees and offering expenses and expect to use the remaining net proceeds of million for general corporate purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents inventory prior to reaching technological feasibility  our start up manufacturing costs  such as those relating to the assembly  testing and performance validation of the helicos genetic analysis system  were expensed to research and development as the costs were incurred 
when management determined that the helicos system was ready for commercial launch during december  we began capitalizing our manufacturing costs to inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
included in inventory are raw materials  work in process and finished goods used in the production of our first commercial product  the heliscope system and related reagents 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs will be required 
we value inventory in accordance with sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb  chapter  or sfas no 
sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we have concluded that because we are not yet functioning under normal capacity  our production level is abnormally low 
as such  abnormal costs such as the unfavorable labor  overhead and absorption variances were recognized as current period charges  rather than as a portion of the inventory cost  during the year ended december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
and emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements 
sab no 
requires that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery of goods occurs through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
eitf no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
in instances where we sell instruments with a related installation obligation  we will allocate the revenue between the instrument and the installation based on relative fair value at the time of the sale 
the instrument revenue will be recognized when title and risk of loss passes 
the installation revenue will be recognized when the installation is performed 
if fair value is not available for any undelivered element  revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery and installation are complete 
in instances where we sell an instrument with specified acceptance criteria  we will defer revenue recognition until such acceptance has been obtained 
the customer may also purchase a service contract 
revenue from service contracts will be recognized ratably over the service period 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets long lived assets primarily include property and equipment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
determining the fair value of long lived assets includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we plan to perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments to estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the underlying receivables and our experiences of specific collection issues
