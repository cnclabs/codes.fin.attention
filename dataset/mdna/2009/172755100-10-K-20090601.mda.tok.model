overview we were incorporated in california in  became a public company in and were reincorporated in the state of delaware in february through most of our corporate existence  we provided ics for personal computer applications  including personal computer pc graphics and storage 
in  we refocused our business efforts away from these areas  which we believed had become commodity like in terms of pricing and offered diminished opportunities for sustained product differentiation and profitability 
we reinforced our commitment to operate efficiently and profitably by taking strategic actions beginning in to improve our top and bottom line growth  including improving efficiencies by focusing on our product lines including mixed signal audio  audio dsp  and energy products  divesting ourselves of our digital page of 
table of contents video product line assets and non core products to focus on our core strengths  and enhancing our capital structure by completing a million stock repurchase program in fiscal year to increase long term stockholder value 
we continued this process in fiscal year with focusing on winning new designs  growing our market share in portable audio products in particular  and by laying the foundation for growth in our dsp and energy products 
the credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the global economy impacted both the semiconductor industry and our own results of operations in fiscal year the recession reduced both business and consumer spending  which impacted sales of end user products that incorporate our components 
consequently  for fiscal year net sales were down approximately percent from the preceding year 
however  our strength in revenue from new products and prudent expense management were key drivers in the company maintaining bottom line profitability for the year as a whole while establishing a solid base for future growth 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we announced a million stock repurchase program 
no share repurchases under this program have occurred as of march  during fiscal year  we acquired percent of the outstanding stock of apex for a purchase price of approximately million  consisting primarily of cash and direct acquisition costs 
apex designs and produces integrated circuits  hybrids and modules used in a wide range of industrial and aerospace applications that require high power precision analog products  such as pwm s and power amplifiers 
these precision amplifiers are used for driving motors and piezoelectric devices  programmable power supplies and other devices requiring high power and precision control 
in fiscal year we took additional steps to improve our competitive cost structure 
first  we committed to a plan to close caretta integrated circuits caretta  a subsidiary based in shanghai  china 
we also made a strategic decision to further streamline our organization structure which resulted in an additional headcount reduction of employees 
finally  on january   we announced that our board authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 
the company completed this share repurchase program on april  and purchased a total of million shares  or approximately of the total number of shares outstanding prior to the program 
all shares of our common stock that were repurchased were cancelled as of june  results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations for each of the past three fiscal years as a percentage of net sales 
all percentage amounts were calculated using the underlying data in thousands fiscal years ended march  march  march  net sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring costs and other  net impairment of non marketable securities acquired in process research and development provision for litigation expenses impairment of intangible assets income loss from operations realized gain on marketable securities interest income other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss page of 
table of contents net sales commencing with fiscal year  we report sales in two product categories audio products and energy products 
the energy product category had previously been referred to as industrial  but has been revised to reflect our focus on integrated circuits designed for a variety of energy exploration  measurement and control applications 
revenue in the new energy product line category includes certain product revenue such as arm and communication that is not an ongoing focus or typically considered an energy related product 
our sales by product line is as follows in thousands march  march  march  audio products energy products total net sales for fiscal year decreased percent  to million from million in fiscal year the drop in net sales reflects a million decrease in energy product sales and a million decrease in audio product sales 
within the energy product group  sales decreases were primarily attributable to seismic  industrial a d converters and amplifiers  communications  and arm processor based products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in apex precision power product sales  primarily attributable to a full years contributions in fiscal year  as apex was acquired by the company on july  the audio products group experienced substantial growth from its portable products  which were partially offset by decreases in dac and adc product sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  virtually unchanged versus sales of million in fiscal year fiscal year net sales were impacted by a contribution of million from apex precision power products  which were acquired by the company on july   and by a million increase in sales of portable products from our audio product line 
these sales increases were offset by unfavorable sales variances from various products within the audio and energy product lines 
in particular  dac  interface  and adc products within the audio products group experienced sales reductions in fiscal year versus fiscal year  while seismic and communications products incurred unfavorable sales variances within the energy product group 
export sales  principally to asia  including sales to us based customers with manufacturing plants overseas  were approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year export sales to customers located in asia were percent of net sales in fiscal year  percent of net sales in fiscal year  and percent of net sales in fiscal year all other export sales represented percent  percent  and percent of net sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars 
during fiscal years   and  we did not enter into any foreign currency hedging contracts 
sales to avnet  inc  our largest distributor  represented percent  percent  and percent of net sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in sales to avnet from fiscal year to fiscal year is partially related to avnet s acquisition of azzurri technology ltd  a former distributor for cirrus logic  early in fiscal year we had one end customer whose sales revenues represented more than of the company s net sales for the fiscal year ending march   while sales to our ten largest customers represented approximately of our revenues 
no other customer or distributor represented more than percent of net sales in fiscal years   or the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in their orders could have an adverse affect on our sales 
gross margin gross margin was percent in fiscal year  down from percent in fiscal year the decrease in margin from fiscal year was mainly due to changes in both customer and product mix 
the audio product group experienced a reduction in margin from fiscal year to fiscal year  which was partially page of 
table of contents offset by an increase in energy product margin for this same period 
the sale of product that had been written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent  to gross margin compared to contribution of approximately million  or percent  in fiscal year in total  excess and obsolete inventory charges decreased by million from fiscal year  which increased gross margin by percentage points 
gross margin was percent in fiscal year  down from percent in fiscal year the decrease in margins from fiscal year was mainly due to changes in both customer and product mix 
both the audio product group margin and energy product group margin experienced slight decreases in fiscal year versus fiscal year the sale of product that had been written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent  to gross margin compared to contribution of approximately million  or percent  in fiscal year in total  excess and obsolete inventory charges increased by million from fiscal year  which decreased gross margin by percentage points 
research and development expenses fiscal year research and development expenses decreased million from fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in product development expenses of million  as a result of lower mask expenses and engineering wafer costs 
in addition  salary and benefit costs associated with research and development personnel decreased by million 
finally  non recurring engineering worked performed and billed to third parties resulted in an additional million reduction in research and development expenses 
fiscal year research and development expenses increased million from fiscal year depreciation and amortization charges increased million  substantially due to the acquisition of apex on july   and also due to the acquisition of certain assets from tripath technologies  inc for million in the first quarter of fiscal year salary and benefits costs increased by million  largely attributable to the acquisition of apex 
finally  product development expenses increased by million due to higher spending for outsourced firmware  engineering test time  and tape outs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal year  or percent  compared to fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in professional expenses caused by the absence of fees associated with the internal stock option investigation performed in fiscal year and the reduction in silvaco lawsuit expenses 
see also part item legal proceedings for additional discussion regarding the silvaco data systems lawsuit 
commission expense decreased million due primarily to lower sales and fluctuations in commissionable product mix in fiscal year versus fiscal year salaries and benefits costs were million lower in fiscal year versus fiscal year  primarily due to reduced headcount and other associated employee costs 
finally  occupancy costs in fiscal year were million lower than in fiscal year  primarily due to the termination of a lease in fremont  california 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  largely due to a million increase in professional expenses  primarily legal fees attributable to the sec stock option investigation and the silvaco lawsuit 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in fees attributable to our internal stock option investigation expenses incurred in fiscal year restructuring costs and other  net during fiscal year  we recorded net restructuring charges of million as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption restructuring costs and other  net 
this net charge was comprised primarily of two separate steps taken to improve our competitive cost structure 
first  we committed to a plan to close caretta  a subsidiary based in shanghai  china 
this action eliminated approximately positions in china during the company s fourth fiscal quarter  and resulted in the company recording primarily a non cash charge for the assets and goodwill related to caretta of million  as well as million in cash payments for the affected employees 
also in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we page of 
table of contents reduced headcount by employees 
the restructuring charge associated with this activity amounted to million  and were primarily related to employee severance costs 
also in fiscal year  in connection with the expiration of a lease agreement in fremont  california in december  we recorded a million reduction to the fiscal year and restructuring liabilities to reduce the accrual to the estimated final settlement amounts 
see also note restructuring costs and other of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item for additional discussion on these restructuring activities 
during fiscal year  we recorded restructuring charges of million to operating expenses primarily related to the transition of design activities from our boulder  colorado office to our headquarters in austin  texas 
the restructuring costs for the closure of the boulder design center were composed of million in severance and relocation costs and million in facility related charges 
approximately employees were affected by this action  five of whom relocated to our austin headquarters 
as of march   we have a remaining restructuring accrual for all of our past restructurings of million  primarily related to future lease payments net of anticipated subleases that will be paid over the respective lease terms through fiscal year we have classified million of this restructuring accrual as long term 
impairment of non marketable securities during the second quarter of fiscal year  we determined an impairment indicator existed related to our remaining cost method investment in magnum semiconductor  inc magnum  as magnum had received additional capital funding from other sources  and our portion of the investment was diluted 
we performed a fair value analysis of our cost method investment in magnum in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
based on the results of the analysis on september   we recognized an impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of the magnum cost method investment to zero 
the impairment was recorded as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of non marketable securities 
we previously determined  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  an impairment indicator existed related to our cost method investment in magnum 
we obtained an independent valuation of the fair value of our cost method investment in magnum in accordance with eitf based on the results of the independent valuation  at march   we recognized an impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of the magnum cost method investment to million 
the impairment was recorded as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of non marketable securities 
for more details regarding our investment in magnum  please see note non marketable securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item acquired in process research and development on july   we acquired percent of the outstanding stock of apex 
the results of apex s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
we acquired apex for a purchase price of approximately million  consisting primarily of cash and direct acquisition costs 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and was included in total operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations under the caption acquired in process research and development 
of the remaining purchase price  million was allocated to acquired intangible assets  million was allocated to identified assets including fixed assets  accounts receivable  and inventory  million was allocated to goodwill  and million was allocated to net liabilities assumed 
in fiscal year  a refund of million related to income taxes was received  which reduced goodwill to million 
during fiscal year  we acquired percent of the voting equity interests in caretta  a company based in shanghai  china that specialized in designing power management integrated circuits for the single cell lithium ion battery market 
in allocating the million purchase price  we immediately recognized an expense of million for research and development that was defined as in process at the time of page of 
table of contents acquisition 
this charge is included in total operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations under the caption acquired in process research and development 
of the remaining purchase price  million was allocated to acquired technology  million was allocated to goodwill and million was allocated to net liabilities assumed 
due to the closure of this office  all technology and goodwill was written off in the fourth quarter of fiscal year see note restructuring costs and other of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item for further discussion 
provision for litigation expenses during the second quarter of fiscal year  we recognized a million charge related to previously incurred and current legal fees and expenses associated with our ongoing derivative lawsuits 
approximately million of those costs were capitalized in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of march  based on a proposed settlement of the derivative lawsuits in december  the company believed that it was more likely than not that previously incurred and current legal fees and expenses of million related to this matter would not ultimately be recovered under the company s directors and officers insurance policy and should be expensed 
the charge was recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses under the heading provision for litigation expenses  with a corresponding reduction in other current assets 
additional costs were incurred throughout fiscal year related to this matter resulting in a cumulative amount of million in provisions for litigation expenses as of march  on december   the initial stipulation of settlement the original stipulation between the parties with respect to the derivative lawsuit was filed with the federal court 
on december   the federal court denied the parties proposed stipulation 
on march   a revised stipulation of settlement the revised stipulation was filed with the federal court 
the revised stipulation modified the terms of the original stipulation to address the concerns of the court raised in the court s denial of the original stipulation 
on march   the court preliminarily approved the settlement and scheduled a hearing for may   to consider whether to provide final approval of the settlement and enter judgment thereon 
the ultimate disposition of the case may result in additional financial consequences  which we are unable to predict at this time  and any such adjustments will be recorded in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for contingencies 
see note  legal matters  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
impairment of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we noted several impairment indicators surrounding our patents acquired from tripath in june  we performed an impairment analysis under statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and noted that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated from these patents were less than the carrying amount of the assets 
we then compared the estimated fair value of these assets to their carrying amount and recognized an impairment loss of million 
these assets have a remaining carrying value of million at march  the impairment was recorded as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of intangible assets 
realized gain on marketable securities during the first quarter of fiscal year  we sold all of our shares in prudential financial inc prudential and realized a gain of million 
we received these shares as we were a policy holder at the time of prudential s demutualization 
interest income interest income in fiscal years   and was million  million  and million respectively 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal year compared to fiscal years and was attributable to two factors to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances on which interest was earned  principally attributable to the cash requirements associated with the company s common stock repurchases occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  and also to lower page of 
table of contents yields on invested capital 
on january  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 
the company completed the stock repurchase program on april   for a total of million with million shares repurchased 
income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal year on a pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory rate of percent primarily due to a million charge to tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to increase the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
this increase in the valuation allowance was based on an evaluation of the net us deferred tax assets we expect to utilize in the upcoming year as a result of projected tax basis net income 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal year on a pre tax loss of million  yielding an effective tax rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory rate of percent primarily due to a million charge to tax expense to increase the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
in fiscal year  we released million of the valuation allowance that had been placed on our us deferred tax assets 
this release was based on our history of utilizing deferred tax assets and our expectation to do so again in fiscal year we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year on pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax benefit rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of percent primarily as a result of the realization of deferred tax assets that had been fully reserved and the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that have not yet been utilized 
our effective tax rate also reflected a nonrecurring tax benefit of million that was generated by the reversal of prior year non us tax liabilities due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for the years in which certain potential non us tax liabilities had existed 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we have deferred tax assets generated in non us jurisdictions that we have recognized since it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
outlook the credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the global economy impacted both the semiconductor industry and our own results of operations in fiscal year global business and consumer spending decreased  resulting in lower end user demand for our products particularly during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year in turn  our customers reacted to the lower end user demand by reducing their orders for many of our products 
since we cannot predict the severity  duration or precise impact of the economic downturn on our future financial results  our reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year may not be indicative of our future results 
our outlook for fiscal year reinforces our commitment to drive to consistent operating profitability exclusive of any unusual  non recurring events  such as acquisitions  divestures  impairments  or litigation events 
given current indicators  we expect to maintain operating profitability  exclusive of unforeseen events or a further deterioration in the macro economic environment  by achieving design wins and market share growth and continuing to focus on developing outstanding analog and digital signal processing components for the audio and energy markets 
we remain committed to being a profitable company and utilizing our engineering and intellectual property resources to achieve growth 
we are focused on building a leadership position in our audio and energy product lines 
we believe that we will continue to build on our success in portable audio applications  as we focus on expanding our market reach to include smart phone applications 
in addition  we have new products that support home audio applications  such as sound bars  as well as new automotive audio applications 
during fiscal year  we also launched new energy products which provide new market opportunities related to motor control 
we look to expand our reach into the smart energy markets  as we begin sampling new power factor correction products this year

table of contents overall  we believe that we are well positioned to face the challenges presented by the current economic environment  but future sales  costs  margins  profits and profitability are all influenced by numerous factors  all of which are inherently difficult to forecast 
please refer to item a risk factors for additional information on these factors

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts 
we evaluate the estimates on an on going basis 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we also have policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues and cost of sales on sales to our distributors  and our stock option granting practices  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for purposes of determining the variables used in the calculation of stock compensation expense under the provisions of the financial accounting standard board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment sfas no

with the exception of the expected forfeiture rate  which is not an input  we use these estimates as variables in the black scholes option pricing model 
depending upon the number of stock options granted  any fluctuations in these calculations could have a material effect on the results presented in our consolidated statement of operations

if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we test for impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
an impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of these assets exceeds the fair value of the applicable assets 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note intangibles  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

goodwill is recorded at the time of an acquisition and is calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  or if business conditions change  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluations 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 
our available for sale investments  non marketable securities and other investments are subject to a periodic impairment review pursuant to fsp and fsp investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
this determination requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different than our estimate 
marketable securities are evaluated for impairment if the decline in fair value below cost basis is significant and or has lasted for an extended period of time 
non marketable securities or other investments are page of 
table of contents considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
for investments accounted for using the cost method of accounting  we evaluate information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements  etc 
in addition to quoted market price  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults  and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of the investment 
this list is not all inclusive and we weigh all quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period s operating results to the extent of the decline 
actual values could be different from those estimated by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position

 accounting for income taxes  we provide for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we have provided a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our net us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis by determining whether or not the anticipated pre tax income for the upcoming twelve months is expected to be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized 
if our future income is not sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized  we increase the valuation allowance to the point at which all of the remaining recognized deferred tax assets will be utilized by the anticipated future pre tax income for the next twelve months 
an increase in the valuation allowance results in a simultaneous increase to income tax expense or  in some cases  a decrease in contributed capital 
if our anticipated future pre tax income is sufficient to conclude that additional deferred tax assets should be recognized  we decrease the valuation allowance 
this results in a simultaneous decrease to income tax expense or  possibly  an increase in contributed capital 
see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item restructuring charges for workforce reductions and facilities consolidations reflected in the accompanying financial statements were accrued based upon specific plans established by management  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we use an estimated borrowing rate as the discount rate for all of our restructuring accruals made under sfas no 
our facilities consolidation accruals are based upon our estimates as to the length of time a facility would be vacant  as well as the amount of sublease income we would receive once we sublet the facility  after considering current and projected market conditions 
changes in these estimates could result in an adjustment to our restructuring accruals in a future quarter  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note restructuring costs and other of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies for various legal matters 
see note legal matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether any accruals should be made based on the status of the case  the results of the discovery process and other factors 
if we ultimately determine that an accrual should be made for a legal matter  this accrual could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position and the ultimate outcome may be materially different than our estimate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates on our debt securities  currency movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  and the affect of market factors on the value of our non marketable equity securities 
we assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses as of march  actual results may differ materially 
page of 
table of contents interest rate risk at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could result in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could have resulted in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could have resulted in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
for all of these fiscal years  the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates were limited to our annual interest income and not the underlying principal as we generally have the ability to hold debt related investments to maturity 
the decreased interest rate risk is based solely on a decrease in total cash and marketable securities 
the amounts disclosed in this paragraph are based on a basis point fluctuation in interest rates applied to the average cash balance for that fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange risk our revenue and spending is transacted primarily in us dollars  however  in fiscal years   and  we entered into minimal transactions in other currencies to fund the operating needs of our design  technical support and sales offices outside of the us as of march  and march   a ten percent change in the value of the related currencies would not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates on the value of open exchange contracts  we may  from time to time  have changes in exchange rates that can also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices of our products and the relative costs of operations based overseas 
non marketable securities risk our investments in non marketable securities are affected by many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of market prices  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
such a movement and the underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in  their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings  mergers or private sales 
these types of investments involve a great deal of risk  and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful  consequently  we could lose all or part of our investment 
as of march   our investments in non marketable securities had a carrying value of million 
this carrying amount approximated fair value as of march  during the second quarter of fiscal year  we determined an impairment indicator existed related to our remaining cost method investment in magnum  as magnum had participated in another round of capital funding from other sources  and our portion of the investment was diluted 
we performed a fair value analysis of our cost method investment in magnum in accordance with eitf based on the results of that analysis as of september   we recognized an impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of the magnum cost method investment to zero 
the impairment is recorded as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of non marketable securities 
at march   we had no remaining investments in non marketable securities that have not been fully impaired
