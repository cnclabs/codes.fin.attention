item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in item a of part i  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents overview our business we are engaged in the development  manufacturing  marketing and sale of minimally invasive treatments for aortic disorders 
our primary focus is the marketing and sale of the powerlink system  a catheter based alternative treatment to surgery for aaa 
aaa is a weakening of the wall of the aorta  the largest artery of the body 
once aaa develops  it continues to enlarge and if left untreated becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture 
the overall patient mortality rate for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms is approximately  making it a leading cause of death in the united states 
prior to the acquisition of former endologix and the restructuring that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of  we were researching  developing and marketing a radiation therapy catheter for the treatment of blockages in arteries after angioplasty  or restenosis 
between and  our source of revenues shifted gradually from direct sales of previous catheter and stent products to royalties from licenses of our stent delivery technology 
in june  we licensed to guidant rights to manufacture and distribute products using our focus technology for the delivery of stents in exchange for milestone and royalty payments 
in april  abbott acquired guidant s vascular business  including all rights and obligations under the license 
our license revenue decreased in from in  under our licensing agreement with biolucent  inc  we received  in royalties and fees  including a one time payment of  in exchange for a fully paid up license to certain of our patents 
license revenue from abbott remained at the contractual minimum level of  for and the minimum payment requirement under the agreement expired at december  in  we received de minimus royalties under this agreement prior to its expiration in june sales of our powerlink system are now our only material source of revenue 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe that our current cash balance  in combination with cash receipts generated from sales of the powerlink system and borrowings available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations through at least december  if we do not realize expected revenue and gross margin levels  or if we are unable to manage our operating expenses in line with our revenues  or if we cannot maintain our days sales outstanding accounts receivable ratio  we may not be able to fund our operations through december  in the event that we require additional funding to continue our operations  we will attempt to raise the required capital through either debt or equity arrangements 
we cannot provide any assurance that the required capital would be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that any financing activity would not be dilutive to our current stockholders 
if we are not able to raise additional funds  we may be required to significantly curtail our operations and this would have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
summary of accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collectibility of customer accounts  whether the cost of inventories can be recovered  the value assigned to and estimated useful life of intangible assets  the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities  contingent liabilities and the potential outcome of litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the following critical accounting policies and estimates were used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and accounts receivable we comply with the revenue recognition guidelines in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the relevant receivable is probable at the time of sale  and products have been shipped or used and the customer has taken ownership and assumed risk of loss 
in the past  we have earned royalty revenue  which was included in license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations  as a result of the sale of product rights and technologies to third parties 
royalties were recognized upon the sale of products subject to the royalty by the third party 
we do not offer rights of return and we have no post delivery obligations other than our specified warranty 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on our review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer s payment history 
if additional information becomes available to us indicating the financial condition of the customer is deteriorating  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product s shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record an impairment charge  or expense  for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value recorded for the asset may not be recoverable 
future changes in operations could cause us to write down the asset value and record an expense to better reflect our current estimate of its value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
factors that may impact whether there is potential goodwill impairment include a significant decrease in our stock price and our evaluation of a control premium that may be used when estimating our total fair value 
our stock price may decline  or other factors may arise  which could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential impairment to our indefinite lived intangible assets include legal and regulatory considerations 
income taxes we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the financial statements  as well as operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to zero  because we believe that  based upon a number of factors  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fin fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose  in their financial statements  uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts 
stock based compensation effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payments  or sfas r 
this statement requires us to recognize the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for stock options awarded 
under sfas r  we are required to recognize compensation expense over an award s vesting period based on the award s fair value at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock option grants 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is net of an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and the option s expected life 
the financial statements include such amounts based on our best estimates and judgments 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to the increased productivity of our domestic field sales personnel  and the introduction of our suprarenal proximal extensions and powerlink xl products 
domestic sales increased from million to million  and sales to distributors outside the united states increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to sales to our distributor cosmotec in japan  as well as an increase in sales to distributors in latin america 
we expect that product sales will increase in by an estimated to from to million to million in in the us market the increase is expected due to increased productivity from our sales representatives and the introduction of two new products in the second and third quarters of  and the full year effect of two new products launched in the fourth quarter of outside the us  we expect growth in each of our major markets of europe  japan  and latin america 
license revenue 
license revenue decreased to  in from  in license revenue from abbott remained at the contractual minimum level of  for  and expectedly declined sharply in as the minimum royalty provision of the agreement expired at december  the license expired and was fully paid up in june additionally in  due to our licensing agreement with biolucent  we received  in royalties and fees  including a one time payment of  in exchange for a fully paid up license to certain of our patents in a certain field of use 
beginning january   sales of our powerlink system were our only material source of revenue 
cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue  which includes labor  overhead  materials and parts  rent  depreciation  small tools and supplies  samples for destructive testing  and utilities  among other items  decreased to million from million in this decrease is directly attributable to the substitution of lower cost in house produced graft material in a majority of the products sold in gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher product sales in as compared to and a reduction in the per unit cost of product due to substitution of lower cost in house produced graft material in a majority of the products sold in gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in for these reasons 

table of contents we believe that gross profit dollars will increase marginally in due to higher commercial sales of the powerlink system both in and outside of the united states 
we also expect that gross profit as a percentage of product revenues will increase due to efficiencies from higher manufacturing volumes required to support sales growth 
research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses decreased by to million from million in the decrease primarily resulted from lower costs associated with clinical trials in the period 
we recorded  in and  in  of stock compensation expense 
research  development  and clinical expense has decreased in two consecutive years for the reasons noted in this discussion 
we expect that these expenses will now increase in and future years as we pursue opportunities to develop additional new products for the treatment of aortic disorders 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to higher sales commission payouts on the growth in domestic sales revenue  severance payments  and the implementation of an in depth sales training program 
we recorded million in and  in  respectively  of stock compensation expense 
we expect that marketing and sales expense will increase in for three reasons the marketing related costs to launch two significant new products in the intuitrak delivery system for powerlink in the second quarter and the intuitrak express delivery system for powerlink xl in the third quarter  expenses related to more intensive training of sales representatives  and higher commission expense on the expected increase in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million in the increase was due primarily to increases in patent and legal fees  settlement of the legal dispute with cook medical products  inc  our chief executive officer succession process  and our analysis and response to the unsolicited acquisition proposal from elliott associates 
in addition  stock based compensation expense totaled million in as compared to  in we expect general and administrative expense to decline by approximately million in relative to termination of supply agreement 
termination of supply agreement expense was  in the expense was due to the third amendment to our supply agreement for eptfe graft material with bard peripheral  dated september   which reduced the minimum purchase requirement for the year from million to million  and wherein both parties agreed to terminate the agreement on december  in consideration for the reduction in the minimum purchase requirement for the year  we paid  to bard peripheral 
other income 
other income decreased to  from million in the decrease in other income was primarily the result of a realized gain of  on our investment in biolucent in  lower interest income  and higher interest expense in due to drawing down on the term loan and revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank in september comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to the expansion and increased productivity of our domestic field sales personnel  and increased market acceptance of the powerlink system 
domestic sales increased from million to million  and sales to distributors outside the united states doubled from million in to million in our distribution agreement with edwards lifesciences ag  or edwards lifesciences  was not renewed beyond the original expiration of december  sales to edwards lifesciences in were million 
we replaced the edwards lifesciences distribution agreement with a three year distribution agreement with lemaitre vascular 
this agreement named lemaitre vascular as the exclusive distributor of the powerlink system in ten european countries  including austria  belgium  the czech republic  france  germany  luxembourg  the netherlands  sweden  switzerland  and the united kingdom 
sales to lemaitre in were million 

table of contents license revenue 
license revenue increased to  in from  in  due to our licensing agreement with biolucent 
under that agreement  we received  in royalties and fees  including a one time payment of  in exchange for a fully paid up license to certain of our patents in a certain field of use 
license revenue from abbott and guidant remained at the contractual minimum level of  for  equal to cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue increased to million from million in this increase is directly attributable to the higher unit volume of product sales in compared to gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher product sales in as compared to  license revenue from biolucent  and a reduction in the per unit cost of product due to substitution of lower cost in house produced graft material in a portion of the products sold in gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in for these reasons 
also  the percentage in was impacted by a second quarter charge of  related to the final phase of an earlier limited  voluntary product recall 
research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses decreased by to million from million in the decrease primarily resulted from lower costs associated with clinical trials in the period 
we incurred a charge of  in and  in  for stock compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january  marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to staffing increases in sales and marketing functions in support of the commercial sales of the infrarenal powerlink system in the united states market 
we incurred a charge of  in and  in  respectively  for stock compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million in the increase was due primarily to increases in patent and legal fees and insurance expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense totaling  in as compared to  in  pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january  termination of supply agreement 
termination of supply agreement expense was  in the expense was due to the third amendment to our supply agreement for eptfe graft material with bard peripheral  dated september   which reduced the minimum purchase requirement for the year from million to million  and wherein both parties agreed to terminate the agreement on december  in consideration for the reduction in the minimum purchase requirement for the year  we paid  to bard peripheral 
other income 
other income increased to million from million in the increase in other income was a result of a realized gain of  on our investment in biolucent  offset by less interest income due to a lower invested cash balance 
in  we had a higher cash balance due to a registered direct public offering of our common stock that resulted in net proceeds of million in june liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
historically  we have relied on the sale and issuance of equity securities to provide a significant portion of funding for our operations 
in april  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that would permit us to sell from time to time  up to a total of million of common stock 
in june  we completed an offering of our common stock  which resulted in net proceeds of million  leaving million available under the shelf registration 
in february  we entered into a revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank  under which we may borrow up to million 
all outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus  which is payable on a monthly basis 
the unused portion is subject to an unused 
table of contents revolving line facility fee  payable quarterly  in arrears  on a calendar year basis  in an amount equal to one quarter of one percent per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving line  as determined by the bank 
the credit facility also contains customary covenants regarding operations of our business and financial covenants relating to ratios of current assets to current liabilities and tangible net worth during any calendar quarter and is collateralized by all of our assets with the exception of our intellectual property 
all amounts owing under the credit facility were to become due and payable on february  in september  we drew down million 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all of our covenants under the credit facility 
in july  we entered into an amendment to the credit facility which added a term loan whereby we may borrow up to million and which extended the repayment date for borrowings under the revolving line of credit to july  in september  we drew down the million term loan  all of which was outstanding at december  the term loan requires interest only payments at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus  which is payable on a monthly basis through march  the term loan principal is due in monthly installments beginning in april our existing credit facilities with silicon valley bank contain negative covenants on the operation of our business and financial covenants  including requiring us to maintain a tangible net worth of million 
as of december   our tangible net worth was million 
if we are not able to maintain compliance with our financial covenants  certain terms of our credit facility and term loan will change including an increase in the interest rate and a limitation on the amounts available for borrowing under the credit facility based on eligible accounts receivable 
further  if we do not maintain a tangible net worth of at least million through june  and million thereafter  we will be in default under the credit facility which could allow the lender to accelerate the repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we expect that our continued growth  strong gross margins and expense controls will enable us to achieve positive cash flow from operations in the second quarter of  consequently  we believe that our current cash balance  in combination with cash receipts generated from sales of the powerlink system and borrowings available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for operating and capital expenditures through at least december  if we do not realize expected revenue and gross profit margin levels  or if we are unable to manage our operating expenses in line with our revenues  or if we cannot maintain our days sales outstanding accounts receivable ratio  we may not achieve positive cash flow from operations in the second quarter of  nor be able to fund our operations through december  we believe that the future growth of our business will depend upon our ability to successfully develop new technologies and bring these technologies to market  as well as increased market acceptance of the powerlink system 
if we pursue additional research and development opportunities or fail to increase our penetration of the aaa market  or if we fail to reduce certain discretionary expenditures  as necessary  we may need to seek additional sources of financing 
in the event that we require additional funding to continue our operations  we will attempt to raise the required capital through either debt or equity arrangements 
the timing and amount of our future capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of market acceptance of the powerlink system  our requirements for additional manufacturing capacity  our requirements for additional it infrastructure and systems  our requirements for additional facility space  and the need for additional capital to fund future development programs 
accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable  net  increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to the increase in product sales in 
table of contents inventories 
inventories decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of a lower cost basis of the eptfe graft material 
accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily attributable to legal fees and litigation matters as well as a change in the commission plan for our sales force 
cash used in operations 
cash used in operations decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the change was primarily attributed to the improved gross margin  increased production efficiencies  and higher sales volume 
cash provided by used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  this change was primarily due to decreased investment in marketable securities in as compared to cash provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   namely as a result of drawing upon our available credit facility and term loan which provided million in cash 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments as of december   expected future cash payments related to contractual obligations were as follows total in thousands contractual obligations borrowings under term loan and credit facilities operating lease obligations interest expense on borrowings other obligations total recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our revolving credit facility and our term loan with silicon valley bank 
under our revolving credit facility  all outstanding amounts bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rate under this facility was at december  under our term loan  interest only payments are due monthly at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus through march   and the principle is due in monthly installments beginning in april as of december   we had million outstanding under our term loan 
the interest rate under this loan was at december  under both the term loan and the credit facility  interest is payable on a monthly basis which may expose us to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
we estimate that a change in interest rate on our revolving credit facility would not have a material effect on our net loss for the year ended december  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and 
table of contents reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at december   our investment portfolio included only money market instruments 
foreign currency transaction risk 
we do not currently have material foreign currency exposure as the majority of our assets are denominated in us currency and our foreign currency based transaction exchange risk is not material 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded   and  respectively  of foreign currency transaction gains losses
