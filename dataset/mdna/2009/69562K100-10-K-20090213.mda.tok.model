item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that develops novel drugs 
in june  we filed an nda for remoxy with the fda 
in august  we and king announced that an nda for remoxy was accepted by the fda and granted priority review 
a priority review generally results in a reduction in the time for fda review of an nda from months to approximately months from the date of the nda submission 
in december  we received a complete response letter for our nda for remoxy in which the fda determined that the nda was not approved 
the fda indicated additional non clinical data will be required to support the approval of remoxy 
the fda has not requested or recommended additional clinical efficacy studies prior to approval 
we plan to meet with the fda in the second quarter of regarding the nda for remoxy 
we believe this fda meeting will provide us with a more reliable context in which to make projections about remoxy 
we also have the following investigational drug candidates in clinical programs pti and pti  which are proprietary  abuse resistant forms of opioid drugs 
a novel radio labeled monoclonal antibody drug candidate to treat metastatic melanoma  a deadly form of skin cancer 
we and king are engaged in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize remoxy  pti  pti and another abuse resistant opioid painkiller 
king is also obligated to fund development expenses incurred by us pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
all of our collaboration  contract and milestone revenues are recognized pursuant to our strategic alliance with king 
king made an upfront cash payment of million to us at the closing of this strategic alliance in king made milestone payments to us of million related to acceptance by the fda of the nda for remoxy and million in in connection with the acceptance by the fda of the investigational new drug application  or ind for pti and million in in connection with the acceptance by the fda of the ind for pti we could also receive from king up to million in additional milestone payments in the course of clinical development of remoxy  pti  pti and other abuse resistant opioid painkillers under the strategic alliance 
subject to certain limitations  king is also obligated to fund certain development expenses incurred by us pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
king is obligated to fund the commercialization expenses of  and has the exclusive right to market and sell  drugs developed in connection with the strategic alliance 
king is obligated to pay us a royalty on net sales of drugs developed in connection with the strategic alliance  except as to the first billion in net sales of such drugs  for which the royalty is set at 
although we were profitable in  and based on payments received from king and interest income  we have yet to generate any revenues from product sales 
through december   we have recorded an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  salaries and other personnel related costs and general corporate expenses 
research and development activities include costs of preclinical and clinical trials as well as clinical supplies associated with our drug candidates 
salaries and other personnel related costs include non cash stock based compensation associated with options granted to employees and non employees 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially from period to period as a result of the timing and enrollment rates of clinical trials for our drug candidates and our need for clinical supplies 

table of contents we expect to continue to use significant cash resources in our operations for the next several years 
our cash requirements for operating activities and capital expenditures will increase substantially in the future as we continue to conduct preclinical and clinical trials for our drug candidates  seek regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
product revenue will depend on our ability to receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully market  our drug candidates 
if our development efforts result in regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our drug candidates  we will generate revenue from direct sales of our drugs and or  if we license our drugs to future collaborators  from the receipt of license fees and royalties from sales of licensed products 
we conduct our research and development programs through a combination of internal and collaborative programs 
we rely on arrangements with universities  our collaborators  contract research organizations and clinical research sites for a significant portion of our product development efforts 
we focus substantially all our research and development efforts on the research and development of opioid drugs for the treatment of pain 
the following table summarizes expenses by category for research and development efforts in thousands years ended december  compensation contractor fees supplies other common costs contractor fees generally include expenses for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
supplies generally include costs for formulation and manufacturing activities 
other generally includes the allocation of common costs such as facilities 
our technology has been applied across certain of our portfolio of drug candidates 
data  know how  personnel  clinical results  research results and other matters related to the research and development of any one of our drug candidates also relate to  and further the development of  our other drug candidates 
for example  we expect that results of non clinical studies  such as pharmacokinetics  toxicology and other studies  regarding certain components of our drug candidate remoxy to be applicable to the other potential drug candidates that may arise out of our collaboration with king since all such potential drug candidates are expected to utilize such components 
as a result  costs allocated to a specific drug candidate may not necessarily reflect the actual costs surrounding research and development of that drug candidate due to cross application of the foregoing 
we are developing a novel antibody technology that may transform how metastatic melanoma is treated 
we spent approximately  million and million on this technology  primarily in contractor fees and supplies  during  and  respectively 
in  we announced that we licensed certain technology and are developing this technology for hemophilia and pain management 
we spent approximately and million  primarily in contractor fees and supplies during and on this technology 

table of contents estimating the dates of completion of clinical development  and the costs to complete development  of our drug candidates would be highly speculative  subjective and potentially misleading 
pharmaceutical products take a significant amount of time to research  develop and commercialize 
the clinical trial portion of the development of a new drug alone usually spans several years 
we expect to reassess our future research and development plans based on our review of data we receive from our current research and development activities 
the cost and pace of our future research and development activities are linked and subject to change 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and interest income in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those estimates related to contract agreements  research collaborations and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following items in our financial statements require significant estimates and judgments expenses for clinical trials 
expenses for clinical trials are incurred from planning through patient enrollment to reporting of the underlying data 
we estimate expenses incurred for clinical trials that are in process based on patient enrollment and based on clinical data collection and management 
costs that are associated with patient enrollment are recognized as each patient in the clinical trial completes enrollment 
estimated clinical trial costs related to enrollment can vary based on numerous factors  including expected number of patients in trials  the number of patients that do not complete participation in a trial  and when a patient drops out of a trial 
information about patient enrollment can become available significantly after we report our expenses for clinical trials  in which case we would change our estimate of the remaining cost of a trial 
costs that are based on clinical data collection and management are recognized based on estimates of unbilled goods and services received 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we would accrue an amount based on estimates of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with winding down the clinical trial 
stock based compensation 
the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  requires companies to recognize expense in the income statement for the fair value of all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee stock options and other share based awards 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method 
we record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
we use the black scholes option valuation model  or black scholes and use the single option award approach and straight line attribution method for stock options granted since january  using this approach  the compensation cost is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each respective stock option  generally four years 
we estimate forfeitures when recognizing expense under sfas r and adjust this estimate periodically based on the extent to which future actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
accordingly  we have estimated forfeiture percentages for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption and for awards granted subsequent to the date of adoption 
we have granted share based awards that vest upon achievement of certain performance criteria  or performance awards 
the value of these awards is the product of the number of shares of our common stock to be issued under the award multiplied by the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant 
these awards include future performance conditions 
we estimate an implicit service period for achieving these performance conditions 
performance awards vest and common stock 
table of contents is issued on achieving performance conditions 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for performance awards when we conclude that achieving a performance condition is probable  consistent with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we periodically review and update as appropriate our estimates of the implicit service periods and the likelihood of achieving the performance conditions 
revenue recognition and deferred program fee revenue 
in connection with our strategic alliance with king we recognize program fee revenue  collaboration revenue and milestone revenue 
program fee revenue is derived from the upfront payment from king received in december and is recognized ratably over our estimate of the development period of four drug candidates expected to be developed under the strategic alliance with king 
of those drug candidates  remoxy has completed a phase iii clinical trial  one drug candidate is in phase i clinical trials and two potential drug candidates are at the pre clinical stage 
we currently estimate the development period for all four expected drug candidates to extend through september we review the estimated development period on a quarterly basis and change it if appropriate based upon our latest expectations 
for example  in the fourth quarter of we determined that the development period should be extended from the third quarter of based upon recent clinical developments and updated communications with king regarding product development plans 
collaboration revenues from reimbursement of development expenses are generally recognized when king has completed its review of the expenses invoiced to them 
king is obligated to pay us milestone payments contingent upon the achievement of certain substantive events in the clinical development of remoxy and the other abuse resistant opioid painkillers under the strategic alliance 
we recognize milestone payments from king as revenue when we achieve the underlying developmental milestone as the milestone payments are not dependent upon any other future activities or achievement of any other future milestones and the achievement of each of the developmental milestones were substantively at risk and contingent at the effective date of the collaboration 
substantial effort is involved in achieving each of the developmental milestones 
these milestones represent the culmination of discrete earnings processes and the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation with the level of effort associated with the achievement of the milestone 
each milestone payment is non refundable and non creditable when made 
the ongoing research and development services being provided to king under the collaboration are priced at fair value based upon the reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the collaboration with king 
taxes 
we make estimates and judgments in determining our provision for benefit from income taxes 
we have accumulated significant deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any 
we are uncertain of the timing and amount of any future earnings 
accordingly  except for million of net deferred tax assets recognized on our balance sheet included in other assets as of december   we offset the net deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance 
we may in the future determine that more of our deferred tax assets will likely be realized  in which case we will reduce our valuation allowance in the quarter in which such determination is made 
if the valuation allowance is reduced  we may recognize a benefit from income taxes in our statement of operations in that period 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue program fee revenue king paid us a million upfront fee in connection with the closing of our strategic alliance with king in december revenues recognized from amortization of this upfront fee were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million from to is due to the extension of the development period over which we recognize the program fee revenue in the 
table of contents fourth quarter of based upon recent clinical developments and communications with king regarding product development plans 
we expect to recognize the rest of the program fee ratably over our estimate of the remainder of the development period under the strategic alliance with king 
we currently estimate the development period for all four expected drug candidates to extend through september revenue collaboration revenue collaboration revenues were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues related to reimbursement of our development expenses incurred pursuant to the king strategic alliance 
the decrease of million in was primarily because revenue included recognition of approximately million in costs incurred by us between september and december that were subject to completion of king s review 
king reviewed and paid for these expenses in we incurred expenses of million in  which were reimbursement by king in we incurred expenses of million in for which we expect king to complete their review and to reimburse us in we expect the amount and timing of collaboration revenue to fluctuate in relation to the amount and timing of the underlying research and development expenses  as well as the timing of completion of king s review of submitted expenses 
revenue milestone revenue milestone revenue was million in the year ended december  king made a milestone payments of million to us on acceptance of the nda for remoxy by the fda and million in connection with the acceptance by the fda of the ind for pti research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including preclinical testing  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
research and development expense decreased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to decreases in clinical and development activities for remoxy partially offset by increased activities in metastatic melanoma  hemophilia and other projects 
research and development expenses included non cash stock related compensation costs of million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
non cash stock related compensation costs in included million associated with vesting of performance awards 
we expect research and development expenses to fluctuate over the next several years as we continue our development efforts 
we expect our development efforts to result in our drug candidates progressing through various stages of clinical trials  including current and potential clinical trials for our other abuse resistant drug candidates  as well as further clinical development of our product candidates in metastatic melanoma and hemophilia 
king is obligated to reimburse development expenses for our abuse resistant drug candidates pursuant to our collaboration 
our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies 

table of contents general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increases in non cash stock related compensation costs 
general and administrative expenses included non cash stock related compensation costs of million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
non cash stock related compensation costs in included million associated with vesting of performance awards 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase over the next several years in connection with support of precommercialization and commercialization activities for our drug candidates 
the increase may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of these activities and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to decreases in prevailing interest rates on investments in marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  decreased average balances of marketable securities 
we expect our interest income to decrease in the future as we use cash to fund our operations 
benefit from income taxes in we had an income tax benefit of million comprised of a federal tax benefit of million  net of a provision for state taxes of million 
the federal income tax benefit is primarily due to the recognition in of previously generated net operating losses and tax credits 
we did not provide for income taxes in because we did not have taxable income in  primarily due to all of our program fee revenue having been recognized for tax purposes in prior years 
years ended december  and revenue program fee revenue king paid us a million upfront fee in connection with the closing of our strategic alliance with king in december revenues recognized from amortization of this upfront fee were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million in is due to the extension of the development period over which we recognize the program fee revenue in the fourth quarter of based upon recent clinical developments and communications with king regarding product development plans 
revenue collaboration revenue collaboration revenues were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues related to reimbursement of our development expenses incurred pursuant to the king strategic alliance 
the increase of million in was primarily because in we deferred recognition of approximately million in costs incurred by us between september and december that were subject to completion of king s review 
king reviewed and paid for these expenses in we incurred expenses of million in for which king completed their review and reimbursed us in revenue milestone revenue we did not have any milestone revenue in the year ended december  milestone revenue was million for the year end december  in connection with the acceptance by the fda of the investigational new drug application for pti  king made a milestone payment to us of million 

table of contents research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including preclinical testing  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
research and development expense increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increases in clinical and development activities for remoxy  metastatic melanoma and hemophilia 
research and development expenses included non cash stock related compensation costs of million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increases in non cash stock related compensation costs associated with the adoption of sfas r 
general and administrative expenses included non cash stock related compensation costs of million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
interest and other income  net interest and other income net  increased to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to increases in average balances of marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  increases in prevailing interest rates on investments in marketable securities 
provision for income taxes we did not provide for income taxes in because we did not have taxable income in  primarily due to all of our program fee revenue having been recognized for tax purposes in prior years 
in  king made an upfront cash payment of million to us in connection with our strategic alliance 
we had taxable income for primarily due to the recognition in of million of the upfront cash payment for income tax purposes 
we reduced our taxable income for with deductions related to a combination of our net operating losses and tax credits from prior years 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private stock offerings  payments received under our strategic alliance with king  and interest earned on our investments 
we intend to continue to use our capital resources to fund research and development activities  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the change was primarily due to the increase in of million received in milestone payments offset in part by a million decrease in collaboration revenue 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities was million in the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  investing activities for both years consisted primarily of the purchase and sale of marketable securities 
our investing activities to purchase property  equipment and leasehold improvements used no cash for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in the year ended december   we wrote off our property  equipment and leasehold improvements and accumulated depreciation and amortization related to our lease of office space in south san francisco because we no longer use that office space 
we expect to continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our operations 
net cash used in financing activities was million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  in  we completed a stock buyback plan for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
we used cash of million in and million in to purchase our common stock on the open market 
other cash from financing activities in both and consisted primarily of proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to stock option exercises and stock purchased by employees pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
we have million of total deferred tax assets at december  realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any 
we are uncertain about the timing and amount of any future earnings 
we have concluded that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  except for million of deferred tax assets included in other assets as of december   we offset the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance 
there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or interpretation liabilities 
our net interpretation liability at december  does not result in a material contractual obligation 
we currently lease approximately  square feet of general office space pursuant to non cancelable operating leases that will expire in and future minimum lease payments for our leases are as follows for the years ended december  in thousands total future minimum lease payments we believe that our facilities are adequate and suitable for our current needs 
we have license agreements that require us to make milestone payments upon the successful achievement of milestones  including clinical milestones 
our license agreements also require us to pay certain royalties to our licensors if we succeed in fully commercializing products under these license agreements 
all of these potential future payments are cancelable as of december  our formulation agreement with durect corporation obligates us to make certain milestone payments upon achieving clinical milestones and regulatory milestones 
king is obligated to reimburse us for any of our milestone payments and royalty payments to durect corporation 
we have an accumulated deficit of million at december  we expect our cash requirements to be significant in the future 
the amount and timing of our future cash requirements will depend on regulatory and market acceptance of our drug candidates and the resources we devote to researching and developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products 
we believe that our current resources should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we may seek additional future funding through public or private financing within this timeframe  if such funding is available and on terms acceptable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have 
table of contents been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by approximately million 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and or money market funds that invest in such securities 
we have no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments 
as of december   our investments consisted of investments in corporate and government notes and obligations or in money market accounts and checking funds with variable market rates of interest 
we believe our credit risk is immaterial
