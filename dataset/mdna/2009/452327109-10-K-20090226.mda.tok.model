item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to provide an overview of the business to help facilitate an understanding of significant factors influencing our historical operating results  financial condition and cash flows and also to convey our expectations of the potential impact of known trends  events  or uncertainties that may impact our future results 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion and analysis in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions and adequacy of resources 
words such as anticipate  believe  continue  estimate  expect  intend  may  plan  potential  predict  project or similar words or phrases  or the negatives of these words  may identify forward looking statements  but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking 
examples of forward looking statements include  among others  statements regarding the integration of our acquired technologies with our existing technology  the commercial launch of new products and the duration which our existing cash and other resources is expected to fund our operating activities 
forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in item a 
risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere 
the risk factors and other cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function 
using our proprietary technologies  we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing  genotyping and gene expression markets 
in the future  we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics 
our customers include leading genomic research centers  pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies 
our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance  throughput  cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics 
we believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function  which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research  allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients 
on january   we completed the acquisition of solexa for million shares of our common stock 
as a result of that acquisition  we develop and commercialize genetic analysis technologies used to perform a range of analyses  including whole genome re sequencing  gene expression analysis and small rna analysis 
we believe we are the only company with genome scale technology for sequencing  genotyping and gene expression  the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis 
during the first quarter of  we reorganized our operating structure into two newly created business segments  life sciences and diagnostics 
during  the diagnostics business unit had limited business activity and  accordingly  operating results were reported on an aggregate basis as one operating segment 
in the future  at each reporting period end  we will reassess our reportable operating segments  particularly as we enter the market for molecular diagnostics 
on august   we completed the acquisition of avantome 
as consideration for the acquisition  we paid million in cash and may pay up to an additional million in contingent cash consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones 
avantome is a development stage company working on developing low cost  long read sequencing technology 
we expect this technology  if and when available as a product  to have applicability to both the research and diagnostic markets 

table of contents our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high value products and service projects  the impact of seasonal spending patterns  the timing and size of research projects our customers perform  changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns 
any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products  unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines  or impacts from the other factors mentioned above  could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss  we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total stockholders equity was million 
our losses have principally occurred as a result of acquired in process research and development ipr d charges of million related to our acquisition of avantome in and million related to our acquisition of solexa in  the substantial resources required for the research  development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services and a charge of million in primarily related to settlement of our litigation with affymetrix 
we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research and development over the next several years 
we will also need to increase our selling  general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems  other products and services 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services 
product revenue consists of sales of arrays  reagents  flow cells  instrumentation  oligonucleotides oligos and associated freight charges 
service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services  extended warranty sales and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
under sab no 
 revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 
revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer  provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of instrumentation is recognized when earned  which is generally upon shipment 
revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned  which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer 

table of contents in order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable  we ensure there are no refund rights 
if payment terms are based on future performance or a right of return exists  we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
changes in judgments and estimates regarding application of sab no 
might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized 
sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one year warranty 
we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts  which are generally for one or two years  upon the expiration of the initial warranty 
revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period 
reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates  gross margins could be adversely affected 
while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine that the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
investments effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurement 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
sfas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
in october  the fasb issued fasb fsp sfas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
the fsp clarifies the application of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
we determine fair value of our financial assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
and fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 

table of contents in using this fair value hierarchy and the framework established by sfas no 
 management may be required to make assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk  specifically when using unobservable inputs to determine fair value 
these assumptions are judgmental in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding  review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
inventory valuation we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value 
we must make assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycle and development plans  product expiration and quality issues  historical experience and our current inventory levels 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters  as well as the potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation we make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and litigation settlements 
in determining the carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets arising from acquisitions  we use the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to at least annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets acquired as part of litigation settlements also requires the exercise of judgment 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets  one method used by management is the discounted cash flow method 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in this type of analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
our judgments can also change with respect to the estimated life of intangible assets which could increase or decrease related amortization expense 

table of contents sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projection and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
we have performed our annual test of goodwill as of may  noting no impairment 
no indicators have arisen since management s assessment on may  that would require further assessment 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the future discounted cash flows associated with the use of the asset and adjust the value of the asset accordingly 
certain estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of long lived assets 
these estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the recognition of an impairment charge and the magnitude of any such change 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of these assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 
factors reviewed include projections of pre tax book income over the foreseeable future  determination of cumulative pre tax book income after 
table of contents permanent differences  history of earnings  and reliability of forecasting 
as of december   we have maintained a valuation allowance only against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the more likely than not threshold required under sfas no 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach  excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and december  our fiscal year is the or weeks ending the sunday closest to december  with quarters of or weeks ending the sunday closest to march  june  and september the years ended december  and december  were both weeks 
revenue year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands product revenue service and other revenue total revenue product revenue consists of revenue from the sale of consumables  instruments  oligos and associated freight charges 
the increase in product revenue was driven primarily by sales of our infinium beadchips  sequencing systems and sequencing consumables 
consumables and instruments constituted and of product revenue for the year ended december   respectively  compared to and for the year ended december   respectively 
consumable revenue increased by million over prior year 
growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to strong demand for our infinium and sequencing products  which led to increased sales of million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenue associated with our infinium products can be mainly attributed to the strong demand for our infinium high density beadchips  particularly the human quad  which we began shipping during the first quarter of of the overall increase in infinium beadchip sales  approximately is due to new product introductions with higher average selling prices  while the remaining can be attributed to increased volume 
the increase in sequencing consumables is primarily attributable to the growth in our installed base of instruments and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale 
instrument revenue increased by million over prior year  of which million was due to increased sales of our sequencing systems 
this increase in revenue can be primarily attributed to shipments of our second generation genome analyzer  the genome analyzer ii gaii 
additionally  during the second quarter of  we launched the iscan system  our next generation beadchip scanner to replace the beadarray reader 
any increase in revenue resulting from shipments of this new system was offset by a reduction in sales of our beadarray reader as we stopped manufacturing this product upon the launch of our iscan system 
we expect to see continued growth in product revenue  which can be mainly attributed to the anticipated launch of several new products  sales of existing products and the growth of our installed base of instruments 
service and other revenue includes revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing service contracts  extended warranty contracts  and research revenue 
the increase in service and other revenue is primarily due to an increase of million in extended warranty sales coupled with an increase of million in sequencing service contracts 
this increase was substantially offset by a decline of million in our fast track genotyping service contracts as we shift more towards cspro certified customers 
cspro is a collaborative program through which we certify third party service partners using our products to ensure delivery of performance and data quality equivalent to that available from our internal service offering 
the decline in service revenue as a result of the shift to cspro certified customers has been offset by the resulting increase in our consumable sales to these third party service providers 
if product sales increase  we expect to see continued increases in the sale of our extended warranty contracts 
we also expect sales from snp genotyping and sequencing service contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis  depending on the mix  the number of contracts completed and the success of our certified service providers 
the timing of 
table of contents completion of snp genotyping and sequencing service contracts is highly dependent on the customers schedules for delivering the snps and samples to us 
cost of product and service and other revenue year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands cost of product revenue cost of service and other revenue total cost of product and service and other revenue cost of revenue  which excludes impairment of manufacturing equipment and amortization of intangible assets  represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process  including component materials  assembly labor and overhead  installation  warranty  packaging and delivery costs  as well as costs associated with performing genotyping and sequencing services on behalf of our customers 
the increase in cost of product revenue was primarily driven by higher instrument and consumable sales 
cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to favorable product mix driven by increased sales of our new high density infinium beadchips  with higher average selling prices as compared to the infinium beadchips sold in the prior year 
this was partially offset by increased provisions for inventory obsolescence of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in the inventory reserve is primarily associated with product transitions 
during the year  we recorded reserves for product obsolescence associated with the launch of our new infinium beadchips and the launch of a new sequencing kit 
instrument cost of sales as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly over the prior year due to lower average selling prices mainly associated with promotional campaigns as we launched our next generation beadarray reader  the iscan in the first half of cost of service and other revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to higher extended warranty contract revenue 
cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of related revenue stayed consistent at 
research and development expenses year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  however  there was an overall increase in research and development expenditures compared to the prior year 
costs to support our beadarray technology research activities increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an overall increase in personnel related expenses  increased lab and material expenses associated with the establishment of our manufacturing facility in singapore and the development of new products 
the continued development of our sequencing technology resulted in increased research and development expenditures of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  non cash stock based compensation expense increased by million compared to the year ended december  accrued compensation expense of million 
table of contents associated with contingent consideration for the avantome acquisition completed on august  and expenses related to the development of our newly created diagnostics business unit of million also contributed to the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets 
accordingly  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing  finance  human resources  business development  legal and general management  as well as professional fees  such as expenses for legal and accounting services 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and december  included stock based compensation expenses totaling million and million  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increases of million attributable to personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits and commissions  to support the growth of our business 
included as part of these personnel related expenses is an increase in employee travel expenses of million due to increased headcount and continued international expansion 
the remaining million variance is comprised of increases to non personnel related costs of million  consisting mainly of sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products and an increase of million of non cash stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expense increased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to increases of million in personnel related expenses associated with the growth of our business  million of non cash stock based compensation expense and million in outside consulting services offset by a decrease of million in legal costs primarily related to the settlement of the affymetrix litigation during the first quarter of we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff  add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the expected growth in our business 
impairment of manufacturing equipment year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands impairment of manufacturing equipment  n a the impairment of manufacturing equipment resulted from our assessment of recoverability on a portion of our imaging and decoding systems that were no longer being utilized due to the development of our next generation system and our transition to the infinium hd product line 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenue was and  respectively  for the year ended december  and year ended december  the increase in amortization expense is primarily due to the settlement of our lawsuit with affymetrix on january   resulting in the recording of an intangible asset of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this settlement 
we began amortizing this asset during the first quarter of  causing an increase in amortization of intangible assets of million for the year ended december  the additional increase of million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  represents an additional month of amortization associated with the assets acquired from solexa that we began amortizing in february acquired in process research and development year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands acquired in process research and development as a result of the avantome acquisition in august and the solexa acquisition in january  we recorded acquired ipr d charges of million and million  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these acquisitions 
litigation settlements year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands litigation settlements during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million associated with two settlement agreements 
the total charge is comprised primarily of million related to a million settlement with affymetrix entered into on january  for certain patent litigation between the parties 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the affymetrix settlement 
interest income year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands interest income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily driven by the overall decline in interest rates due to current market conditions coupled with a change in our cash and investment portfolio to a mix of shorter duration maturities and an increased number of agency rated investments 

table of contents interest and other expense  net year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net  consists of interest expense and other income and expenses primarily related to net foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses 
interest and other expense  net  increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest expense related to our convertible debt issued in february was million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  and the year ended december  the increase represents an additional month and a half of interest expense recorded in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  we recorded million in net foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended december  compared to immaterial losses recorded in the year ended december  the gains resulting from our net foreign currency transactions for the year ended december  are due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates coupled with a change in our foreign entity functional currency designation from the local currency to the us dollar beginning the third quarter of as a result of this change  in the third quarter we began re measuring our foreign subsidiaries nonmonetary assets and liabilities and related income and expense accounts to the us dollar and recording the resulting net gain as income 
previously  under local functional currency designation  the effects of translation were recorded within stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss 
provision benefit for income taxes year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands provision benefit for income taxes the provision consists of federal  state and foreign income tax expense for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
in addition for the year ended december   the provision was reduced by million as a result of the release of the valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in and  respectively  unless previously utilized 
in addition  we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in and  respectively  unless previously utilized 
pursuant to section and of the internal revenue code  utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our ownership structure 
these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 
previous limitations due to section and have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of december  based on the available evidence as of december   we were not able to conclude it was more likely than not certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million and million against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets  respectively 
at december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized and  accordingly  we released a portion of our valuation allowance  million  of which was recorded as a reduction to the tax provision

consumables and instruments constituted and of product revenue for the year ended december   respectively  compared to and for the year ended december   respectively 
the change in sales associated with our product mix is due to increased sales in instruments primarily attributable to the genome analyzer  which was introduced during the first quarter of growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to strong demand for our infinium products 
consumable revenue increased by million over prior year  of which million primarily represents increased sales volume of our infinium products 
the increase in revenue associated with our infinium products can be mainly attributed to our humanhap family of beadchips  the human m dna analysis beadchip and our iselect infinium beadchips for more focused content applications 
of the overall increase in infinium beadchip sales  approximately is due to a higher volume of shipments  while the remaining can be attributed to new product introductions and slightly higher average selling prices 
instrument revenue increased by million over prior year  of which million was due to increased sales of our sequencing systems  particularly the genome analyzer and cluster stations 
service and other revenue includes revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing service contracts  extended warranty contracts and research revenue 
service and other revenue increased million over prior year primarily due to the completion of several significant infinium and iselect custom snp genotyping service contracts and sequencing services contracts 
this increase in services represented million of the variance  while the remainder of the difference was generated by an increase in extended warranty contracts of million offset by a decrease in grant revenue of million 
we expect sales from snp genotyping and sequencing services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis  depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed 
the timing of completion of snp genotyping and sequencing services contracts are highly dependent on the customers schedules for delivering the snps and samples to us

at the acquisition date  solexa s ongoing research and development initiatives were primarily involved with the development of its genetic analysis platform for sequencing and expression profiling 
these in process research and development projects are comprised of solexa s reversible terminating nucleotide biochemistry platform  referred to as sequencing by synthesis sbs biochemistry  as well as solexa s reagent  analyzer and sequencing services related technologies  which were valued at million  million  million and million  respectively  at the acquisition date 
although these projects were approximately complete at the acquisition date  they had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the amounts allocated to those projects were written off in the first quarter of  the period the acquisition was consummated 
acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies by us in the future may result in substantial charges for acquired ipr d that may cause fluctuations in our interim or annual operating results 
there were no charges resulting from any acquisitions during the same period in fiscal litigation settlements year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands litigation settlements  n a

interest income year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands interest income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in interest income over the prior year was primarily driven by higher cash balances from the proceeds of our february convertible debt offering  cash acquired as part of the solexa acquisition  and improved operating cash flow 
in addition  we experienced higher effective interest rates on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest and other expense  net year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net  consists of interest expense and other income and expenses related to net foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses 
interest and other expense  net  increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to an immaterial amount for the year ended december  the increase is primarily related to our convertible debt offering in february for the years ended december  and december   we recorded million and million  respectively  in net foreign currency transaction losses  respectively 
in  these foreign currency exchange losses were offset by million of foreign currency exchange gains associated with the sale of our secured convertible debentures with genizon biosciences  inc in the fourth quarter of provision benefit for income taxes year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the provision consists of federal  state  and foreign income tax expense offset in by the release of the valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets 
during the year ended december   we utilized million and million of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  to reduce our federal and state income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in and  respectively  unless previously utilized 
in addition  we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit 
table of contents carryforwards of million and million respectively  which begin to expire in and respectively  unless previously utilized 
pursuant to section and of the internal revenue code  utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our ownership structure 
these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 
previous limitations due to section and have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of december  as of december   we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized and  accordingly we released a portion of our valuation allowance  million of which was recorded as a reduction to the tax provision 
in addition  we established current and long term deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheets of million and million  respectively  and decreased the goodwill balances recorded in conjunction with the cyvera and solexa acquisitions by million and million  respectively 
based upon the available evidence as of december   we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million and million against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cashflow year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of foreign currency translation net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents historically  our sources of cash have included issuance of equity and debt securities  including cash generated from the issuance of our convertible notes in february  our public offering of common stock in august and the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan espp  cash generated from operations  and interest income 
our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and growth of inventory  expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development infrastructure and other working capital needs  cash paid for litigation settlements  cash used for our stock repurchases  expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity and improving our manufacturing efficiency  cash paid for acquisitions  and interest payments on our debt obligations 

table of contents other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include significant increases in our product and services revenue 
as our product sales have increased significantly since  operating income has increased significantly as well  providing us with an increased source of cash to finance the expansion of our operations  and fluctuations in our working capital 
we currently invest our funds in treasury notes  commercial paper  auction rate securities  corporate bonds and us dollar based short maturity mutual funds 
we do not hold securities backed by mortgages 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million compared to million as of december  included in the investment balance as of december  were auction rate securities of million issued primarily by municipalities and universities 
the markets for auction rate securities effectively ceased when the vast majority of auctions failed in february  preventing investors from selling their auction rate securities 
as of december   the securities continued to fail auction and remained illiquid 
as a result  we have recorded an unrealized loss of million for the year ended december   resulting in a reduction to the fair value of our auction rate securities to million as of december  this value was determined in accordance with sfas no 
we used level hierarchical inputs  due to the lack of actively traded market data  including management s assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk 
we based our fair value determination on estimated discounted future cash flows of interest income over a projected period reflective of the length of time we anticipate it will take the securities to become liquid 
additionally  we classified these securities as long term investments as of december  as we believe we may not be able to liquidate our investments within the next year 
as of december   these securities were classified as short term as the failures of these auctions did not occur until february in november  we signed a settlement agreement allowing us to sell our auction rate securities at par value to ubs at our discretion during the period of june  through july  to account for this settlement agreement  we recorded a put option of million and recognized a corresponding gain in earnings during the fourth quarter of the fair value of the put option was determined using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flow  with consideration given to ubs s financial ability to repurchase the auction rate securities beginning june  the fair value of the put option approximates the difference between the par value and fair value of the auction rate securities 
the auction rate securities were previously classified as available for sale  and unrealized gains and losses were recognized in other comprehensive income 
by signing the settlement agreement  we no longer have the intent of holding the auction rate securities until recovery as we will now recover any unrealized loss through the settlement agreement 
accordingly  we elected a one time transfer of the auction rate securities from available for sale to trading and reclassified previously recorded unrealized losses from other comprehensive income to earnings 
we will continue to recognize gains and losses in earnings approximately equal to changes in the fair value of the auction rate securities at each balance sheet date 
these gains and losses will likely be offset by changes in the fair value of the put option as we elect the fair value option subject to our assessment of the counterparties ability to perform

additional cash inflows during this year resulted from the sale and maturity of our investments in available for sale securities of million and million from the exercise of our stock options 
the primary cash outflows during the year ended december  were attributable to the purchase of available for sale securities for million  the one time payment of million made to affymetrix in accordance with the settlement agreement  the repurchase of an aggregate of million shares of our 
table of contents common stock for million and million in capital expenditures primarily for construction in progress associated with the expansion of our san diego facilities  additions to manufacturing equipment as well as the development of our manufacturing facility in singapore 
additionally  on august   we completed our acquisition of avantome  inc as consideration for the acquisition  we paid million in cash  including transaction costs  and may pay up to an additional million in contingent cash consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones 
our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  include expenditures related to our facilities expansion needs  including costs of leasing additional facilities  the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities  support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources both in the united states and abroad  potential strategic acquisitions and investments  the continued advancement of research and development efforts  and improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency 
we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income  as well as the status of each of our new product development programs  will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
our outstanding convertible notes became convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock as of april  the notes continued to be convertible through december  subsequent to year end  on december   a noteholder converted notes in an aggregate principal amount of million 
generally  upon conversion of a note  we must pay the conversion value of the note in cash  up to the principal amount of the note 
any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount is payable in shares of our common stock 
to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the notes  we entered into a hedge transaction 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior notes 
beginning january  the notes ceased to be convertible since the trigger for convertibility was not met during the last calendar quarter of fluctuations in our stock price could cause the conversion feature to trigger in future quarters  resulting in an impact on our working capital 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next twelve months  barring unforeseen circumstances 
operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business  including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
at the present time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures other than development of our additional facility in little chesterford  united kingdom 
the development of this facility is estimated to cost million during although actual costs may vary significantly from our current estimate 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully evolve our sequencing and veracode technologies and to expand our sequencing and snp genotyping product lines  scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments  and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings 
as a result of the factors listed above  we may require additional funding in the future 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms  when needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio  and we believe a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not 
table of contents materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
for example  if a basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in  our interest income would change by approximately million in relation to amounts we would expect to earn  based on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as of december  market price sensitive instruments in order to potentially reduce equity dilution  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions  entitling us to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
in addition  we sold to the counterparties warrants exercisable on a net share basis  for up to  shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the anti dilutive effect of the note hedge transactions  if any  could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants  which occur during  assuming the warrants are exercised 
foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in the americas  europe and asia pacific 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currency for each of our subsidiaries is the us dollar 
accordingly  we remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries to the us dollar at month end exchange rates and remeasure the nonmonetary assets and liabilities to the us dollar at historical rates 
income and expense amounts related to monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the us dollar at the weighted average exchange rates in effect during the relevant period  and income and expense accounts related to nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the us dollar at historical exchange rates 
remeasurement gains and losses are recognized as income  or expense  in the period of occurrence 
in addition  many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity s us functional currency 
these transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
the value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates 
both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income 
the net currency exchange gain recognized on business transactions was million for the year ended december  and is included in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations
