item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
further information about each of our segments  and our business as a whole  is presented below 
our industry trucking we estimate  based on industry sources  that the highly fragmented north american for hire segment of the chemical bulk transport market generated revenues of approximately billion in we specifically operate in the for hire chemical and food grade bulk transport market estimated at billion in where we believe  based on published reports  we have achieved leading market share estimated at  based on revenues 
our competition in the for hire segment is comprised of more than smaller  primarily regional carriers 
based on revenues as reported in bulk transporter s tank truck carrier annual gross revenue report  we operate the largest for hire chemical bulk tank truck network comprising terminals  tractors and trailers in north america 
we believe being a larger carrier facilitates customer service and lane density  and provides a better cost structure 
as such  we are well positioned to expand our business by increasing our market share 
the chemical bulk tank truck industry growth is generally dependent on i volume growth in the industrial chemical industry  ii the rate at which chemical companies outsource their transportation needs  iii the overall capacity of the rail system  and  in particular iv the extent to which chemical companies make use of the rail system for their bulk chemical transportation needs 
as competitive pressures force chemical companies to reduce costs and focus on their core businesses  we believe that chemical companies will consolidate their shipping relationships and outsource a greater portion of their logistics needs to third party tank truck carriers 
we believe that large  national full service carriers will benefit from any such consolidation of relationships and outsourcing of logistics needs and will be able to grow faster than the overall bulk tank truck industry 
as a result of our leading market position  breadth of customer services  flexible business model and decentralized operating structure  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from current industry outsourcing trends 

table of contents container services the iso tank container business generally provides services that facilitate the global movement of liquid and dry bulk chemicals  pharmaceuticals and food grade products 
if the chemical industry continues the recent trend towards the globalization of petro chemical manufacturing capacity  greater quantities of chemicals will be imported into the united states 
further  chemical manufacturers have sought to efficiently transport their products by utilizing iso tank containers 
boasso is the market leader in the north american iso tank container transportation and depot services business  which we estimate is a million market 
competitive barriers our industry is characterized by high barriers to entry such as i the time and cost required to develop the operational infrastructure necessary to handle sensitive chemical cargo  ii the financial and managerial resources required to recruit and train drivers  iii substantial industry regulatory requirements  and iv the significant capital investments required to build a fleet of equipment and establish a network of terminals 
in addition  the industry continues to experience consolidation due to economic and competitive pressures  increasing operating costs for driver recruitment and insurance  and increasing capital investments for equipment and technology 
as the cost and complexity of operating a bulk tank truck business increase  we believe that large  well established carriers like ourselves will gain market share 
market opportunity trucking we expect the complexities and operational challenges faced by chemical manufacturers to continue to grow as the chemical industry evolves 
these complexities and challenges are driven by a variety of industry trends including customer demand for constantly lower prices  global import export of bulk liquid products and the need to get product into the pipeline 
in order to meet these challenges  we believe chemical producers will sell more through distribution as they look for ways to further reduce their costs by streamlining the supply chain 
we believe supply chain efficiencies will be one of the necessary fundamentals for chemical manufacturers competitiveness 
container services the proliferation of global import export of bulk liquid chemicals has driven the movement of basic manufacturing out of the united states and has resulted in an increase in chemical plant infrastructure to service these off shore industries 
driven by this globalization  the iso tank container market is a growing sector of the overall liquid bulk chemical transportation sector 
the resulting demand for distributors that can offer a broad range of services within the supply chain will drive future industry growth in this sector 
our competitive strengths following are our strengths that we believe will allow us to successfully exploit the market opportunities described above 
largest tank truck network in a fragmented industry we provide our customers with access to the largest tractor and tank trailer network in the north american bulk tank truck industry 
in addition  our nationwide network of trucking terminals  tank wash facilities and iso depot services terminals covers all major north american chemical markets and enables us to serve customers with international  national and regional shipping requirements 
our size allows us  our affiliates and our owner operators to benefit from economies of scale in the purchasing of supplies and services  including fuel  tires and insurance coverage 
our greater network density allows us to create efficiencies by increasing utilization through reduced empty miles with more opportunities to generate backhaul loads 
our size also enables us to invest in new technologies that increase our operating efficiency  improve customer service and lower our costs 

table of contents asset light business model our extensive use of affiliates and owner operators results in a highly variable cost structure and significantly reduces our capital investment  thereby allowing us to increase our asset utilization 
this model also contributes to the stability of our cash flow and margins and increases our return on capital 
affiliates are responsible for the necessary capital investments  the operating expenses related to their terminals  and most of the operating expenses related to the business they service 
typically  affiliates purchase or lease tractors for their business directly from the manufacturers and lease trailers from us 
however  some affiliates purchase their own trailers or lease trailers from independent third parties 
owner operators are independent contractors who supply one or more tractors and drivers for our own or our affiliates exclusive use 
as with affiliates  owner operators are responsible for most of the operating expenses related to the business they transport excluding costs related to the acquisition and maintenance of trailers 
with our extensive use of owner operators and affiliates  we can reduce the high capital costs of purchasing and maintaining tractors 
core carrier to most top chemical companies we provide services to most of the top chemical producers with us operations 
our ability to maintain these business relationships reflects our service performance and commitment to safety and reliability 
we have established long term customer relationships with these clients  which help us attract and retain experienced affiliate terminal operators and drivers 
we expect to continue to benefit from our existing relationships with the largest chemical companies while targeting new revenue opportunities from smaller chemical companies and will continue to explore opportunities to expand the scope of services we offer 
broad menu of complementary services our ability to provide value added services that complement our core service differentiates us from smaller competitors and enables us to gain market share  particularly with large customers that seek to use a limited number of core carriers 
by increasing the number of services offered to our customers  we enhance our position as a leading national full service provider in the industry 
these services include storage and warehousing  vendor managed inventory  load tendering and managing private fleets 
enhanced productivity  efficiency and customer service through installed technology we are proactive in our utilization of technology aimed at improving our customer service and operating efficiency 
in contrast to many of our smaller competitors  we have equipped our drivers with various mobile communications systems which enable us to monitor our tractors and communicate with our drivers in the field and enable customers to track the location and monitor the progress of their cargo through the internet 
we also have satellite tracking devices on our trailers to enable us to increase trailer utilization 
our website allows our customers to view bills and generate customized service reports 
we have a centralized order entry  dispatch and billing program system  which enhances our control over our equipment and drivers 
this technology is increasingly important when transporting sensitive cargo in today s heightened security environment 
our operations strategy we are focused on operating our business more efficiently and building a solid infrastructure in order to position ourselves for growth once the economic environment starts to improve 
our cost initiatives implemented in and early are providing us with a competitive cost structure 
we are pursuing less cyclical and less seasonal products and growing a more diversified portfolio of business 
we are focusing on yield management by reviewing high volume lanes in order to identify opportunities for re pricing or exiting business  determining which lanes are profitable for us and improving lane density on reloadable freight 
customer service is at the forefront and will be a differentiator for us in the long run 
these initiatives as described below have gained momentum and have positioned us to leverage our strengths in order to capitalize on the market opportunities that lie ahead 

table of contents opportunistic affiliate conversions and company terminal consolidations we intend to continue to focus on a less capital intensive business model based on affiliates and owner operators 
we continually evaluate our mix of affiliate and company terminals to optimize customer service  revenue growth  profitability and return on investment 
in situations where an efficient and profitable affiliate can absorb a less profitable company terminal  we may consolidate the two operations under the affiliate 
in  we expect to consolidate certain company operated terminals  and to transition other company operated terminals to affiliates 
we expect these actions to result in a larger portion of our revenue being generated by affiliates 
we believe these actions will reduce certain fixed costs and provide a more variable cost structure in our weakened economy 
continued focus on safety and training we have made safety the main focus of our organization 
we implemented several comprehensive process improvement programs to further identify and implement opportunities for sustainable safety improvement 
tangible results of this focus have already manifested themselves in a substantial decrease in preventable events and claim frequency 
we also redesigned our driver training program and updated our online training system to make safety awareness training portable and available to the driver s  dispatchers and terminal managers via the internet 
qdi is committed to conduct its operations in a manner that protects our employees  surrounding communities  customers  and the environment 
as a member of the american chemistry council acc and partner of responsible care  it is our goal to improve the quality of our service and the level of safety 
participation in responsible care is mandatory for all acc member companies 
qdi is only one of six bulk transportation service providers that have reported compliance with responsible care carrier certification management system  which determines applicability and addresses the requirements of laws  regulations  company and other requirements regarding the environmental  health  safety security of its operations 
we have obtained independent certification that our management system is in place and functions according to professional standards and we continue to evaluate and continuously improve our responsible care management system performance 
focus on driver recruitment and retention our recruitment and retention effort is focused on providing drivers a welcoming opportunity with competitive compensation  an emphasis on professional development and an understanding that most drivers first priority is getting home safely to their families 
over the four year period ended december   we have experienced a decline in driver turnover which we believe is half of the reported truckload industry average 
we continue in our commitment to being a driver focused company that provides both technical support and personal respect to drivers 
we offer competitive compensation  encourage input from our drivers when making business decisions  and utilize full time customer service professionals who field inbound calls and emails via our dedicated ask tampa link provided on each company issued blackberry  to ensure driver satisfaction 
our driver organization contains field based recruiters who augment the friendly  small business environment provided by our business model 
expand scope of service capabilities we plan to continue to expand the scope of our service capabilities in order to serve the growing needs of our customer base 
as our customers continue to focus on their core businesses  we believe that they will increasingly rely on primary service transportation companies to provide value added services such as intermodal  tank cleaning and logistics services 
we are a market leader in the iso tank container transportation and depot services business in north america 
we believe that growing our iso tank container depot business offers us the opportunity to expand our service offerings to many of our existing customers and to capitalize on this growing segment which is being driven by the trend towards the globalization of petro chemical manufacturing capacity 

table of contents optimize network we have implemented key initiatives expected to increase profitability by minimizing the number of empty miles driven by our drivers 
we are increasing the visibility of reloadable freight to our affiliate and company terminals to maximize our reload potential 
this allows terminals to increase the utilization of our combined assets and pursue additional revenue opportunities in their respective markets with competitive rates 
trucking services provided bulk transportation service we are primarily engaged in the business of bulk transportation of liquid and dry chemical products through our subsidiary  quality carriers  inc qci 
transportation services are provided through company and affiliate terminals 
as of december   of locations were company operations and the remaining locations were affiliate operations 
owner operators are heavily relied upon to fulfill driver and tractor needs at both company and affiliate terminals 
at december   of the drivers in our network were owner operators and another were affiliate drivers 
we believe the combination of the affiliate program and the emphasis on the use of owner operators results in an efficient and flexible operating structure that provides superior customer service 
affiliate program affiliates are established and maintained by their owners as independent companies with individualized  profit incentives designed to stimulate and preserve the entrepreneurial motivation common to small business owners 
each affiliate enters into a comprehensive contract with qci pursuant to which the affiliate is required to operate its bulk tank truck enterprise exclusively for and on behalf of qci  subject to limited exceptions 
each affiliate is supported by our corporate staff and is linked via computer to central management information systems located at our tampa  florida headquarters 
affiliates gain multiple benefits from their relationship with qci  such as improved equipment utilization through access to our network of operating terminals  access to our broad national and local customer relationships  national driver recruitment  standardized safety training for drivers  tankwashers and mechanics and expanded marketing and sales resources 
affiliates gain further value from qci s management information systems  which provide essential operating and financial reports while simplifying daily operating situations with system wide technology support through tmw dispatch billing platforms and various mobile communication technologies for en route electronic linkage 
affiliates also derive significant financial benefit through our purchasing leverage on items such as insurance coverage  tractors  fuel and tires 
affiliates operate under the marketing identity of qci and typically receive a percentage of gross revenues from each shipment they transport 
affiliates are responsible for their own operating expenses  such as maintenance and workers compensation insurance 
this operating model creates a variable cost structure for qci 
we pay affiliates each week on the basis of completed billings to customers from the previous week 
our weekly settlement program deducts any amounts advanced to affiliates and their individual drivers for fuel  insurance  loans or other miscellaneous operating expenses  including rental charges for qci s tank trailers 
we reimburse affiliates for certain expenses billed back to customers  including fuel  tolls and scaling charges 
affiliate contracts generally contain restrictive covenants prohibiting them from competing directly with qci for a period of one year following termination of the contract 
in addition  affiliates are required to meet all qci standard operating procedures as well as being required to submit regular financial statements 
affiliates employ their own drivers and personnel as well as engage owner operators who are contracted with qci 
all affiliate owner operators and affiliate employee drivers must meet qci s operating standards and requirements 
affiliates are required to pay for and provide evidence of their own workers compensation coverage  which must meet both company established and statutory coverage levels 
affiliates are provided  as part of their contract  property damage and general liability insurance  subject to certain deductibles per incident 
expenses exceeding the prescribed deductible limits of the affiliate are the responsibility of qci or its insurer 

table of contents owner operators qci terminals and affiliates extensively utilize owner operators 
owner operators are independent contractors who  through a contract with qci  supply one or more tractors and drivers for qci or affiliate use 
qci retains owner operators under contracts generally terminable by either party upon short notice 
in exchange for the services rendered  owner operators are normally paid a fixed percentage of the revenues generated for each load hauled or on a per mile rate 
the owner operator pays all tractor operating expenses such as fuel  physical damage insurance  tractor maintenance  fuel taxes and highway use taxes 
however  we reimburse owner operators for certain expenses passed through to our customers  such as fuel surcharges  tolls and scaling charges 
qci attempts to enhance the profitability of our owner operators through purchasing programs offered by us directly or indirectly through outsourcing arrangements that take advantage of our significant purchasing power 
these programs cover operating expenses such as tractors  fuel  tires  occupational accident insurance and physical damage insurance 
drivers utilized by qci or an affiliate must meet specified guidelines for driving experience  safety records  tank truck experience and physical examinations in accordance with dot regulations 
we emphasize safety to our owner operators  affiliate drivers and employee drivers and maintain driver safety inspection programs  safety awards  terminal safety meetings and stringent driver qualifications 
tank wash operations to maximize equipment utilization and efficiency we rely on tank wash facilities owned and operated by our subsidiaries  quality services  inc qsi and boasso  and affiliate owned tank wash facilities located throughout our operating network 
these facilities allow us to generate tank washing fees from owner operators and affiliates as well as from other carriers and shippers 
we believe that the availability of these facilities enables us to provide an integrated service package to our customers and minimizes the risk of cost escalation associated with sole reliance on third party tank wash vendors 
owner operator and affiliate services we offer purchasing programs that take advantage of our significant purchasing power for products and services such as fuel  tractors  and tires as well as physical damage  occupational accident and workers compensation insurance 
we believe that these programs strengthen our relationship with our owner operators and improve driver recruitment 
intermodal and transloading in support of our liquid and dry bulk truck operations  we offer our customers supplementary services in the areas of import export container drayage to and from major port operations  domestic intermodal door to door service  and railcar to truck transloading services 
container services provided intermodal tank container services in addition to intermodal iso tank transportation services  boasso provides tank cleaning  heating  testing  maintenance and storage services to customers in the rail  road and marine shipping industries  with particular focus on the chemical industry 
tank containers are among the most specially configured and regulated vessels in the intermodal industry  requiring experienced and specialized technicians for cleaning  inspection  repair  testing  modification and refurbishment 
boasso provides these services  plus product heating and storage services  at most of its container depots 
boasso has heavy lifting  transloading and other specialty equipment to provide a wide range of services for the tank container niche of the intermodal transportation industry 

table of contents transportation services boasso utilizes its fleet of approximately company operated and independent owner operated tractors  as well as a fleet of approximately  chassis to provide local and over the road trucking primarily within the proximity of the port cities where its depots are located  with a special emphasis on the handling of intermodal tank containers 
boasso uses radio dispatch to provide local transportation needs  at any time of the day  to meet its customers production schedule and or shipping departure requirements 
we believe that our customers are attracted to boasso s service offerings by its well maintained equipment  special training  safety programs and regulatory compliance 
equipment sales boasso s equipment sales division provides its customers with intermodal shipping containers  tank containers  special equipment or custom containers with different characteristics as to construction  sizes or types that its customers use for portable alternative storage or office space 
operations driver recruitment and retention qci and its affiliates dedicate significant resources to recruiting and retaining owner operators and employee drivers 
prospective employee drivers and owner operators are subject to specific eligibility guidelines regarding safety records and driving experience as well as a personal evaluation by our staff 
we utilize only qualified drivers who meet our standards 
these drivers are required to attend a rigorous safety training program administered by the company 
driver recruitment and retention is a primary focus for all operations personnel 
each terminal manager has direct responsibility for hiring and retaining drivers 
qci also has centralized recruiting departments at our tampa corporate office and regional field offices 
we use many of the traditional methods of driver recruitment as well as using many newer methods of driver recruitment  including the use of the internet 
from time to time  we facilitate driver recruitment by offering tractors through lease or purchase agreements 
we also offer assistance to owner operators and affiliate drivers to purchase the specialized equipment needed to handle liquid chemicals 
drivers and owner operators at december   we utilized  drivers 
of this total   were owner operators  were affiliate drivers  and were company employee drivers 
company personnel at december   we employed  personnel  approximately fewer than at december  we provide our employees with health  dental  vision  life  and other insurance coverage subject to certain premium sharing and deductible provisions 
union labor at december   we had employees drivers in trucking  maintenance or tank wash facilities and approximately drivers at three affiliate terminals who were members of the international brotherhood of teamsters 

table of contents tractors and trailers as of december   we managed a fleet of approximately  tractors and  tank trailers 
the majority of our tanks are single compartment  chemical hauling trailers 
the balance of the fleet is made up of multi compartment trailers  dry bulk trailers  and special use equipment 
the chemical transport units typically have a capacity between  and  gallons and are designed to meet dot specifications for transporting hazardous materials 
each trailer is designed for a useful service life of to years  though this can be extended through upgrades and modifications 
each tractor is designed for a useful life of five to seven years  though this can be extended through upgrades and modifications 
we acquire new tractors for an initial utilization period of seven years 
many of our terminals and our affiliate terminals perform preventative maintenance and receive computer generated reports that indicate when inspection and servicing of units are required 
our maintenance facilities are registered with the dot and are qualified to perform trailer inspections and repairs for our fleet and for equipment owned by third parties 
we also rely on unaffiliated repair shops for many major repairs the following tables show the approximate number and age of trailers and tractors we managed as of december  trailers less than years years years years years greater than years total company affiliate owner operator shipper owned total tractors less than years years years greater than years total company affiliate owner operator total age based upon original date of manufacture  tractor trailer may be substantially refurbished or re manufactured 
leasing we lease and sub lease tractors to owner operators and affiliates and also lease and sub lease trailers to affiliates and other third parties  including shippers 
tractor lease and sub lease terms range from to months and generally include a purchase option 
trailer lease and sub lease terms range from day to months and may include a purchase option 
we derive a portion of our income from leasing these units to owner operators  customers and affiliates 
customer service  quality assurance and billing our quality assurance program is designed to achieve superior customer service through the development and implementation of standardized operating procedures for each area within our company 
the procedures provide guidance in such areas as marketing  contracts  dispatch and terminal operations  driver hiring  safety and training  trailer operations  tractor operations  administrative functions  payroll  settlements  insurance  data processing and fuel tax administration 
we also have an internal audit department that helps monitor and ensure 
table of contents compliance with company policies and procedures 
we have also implemented a quality corrective action procedure to identify  document and correct safety and service non conformance 
we collect data on all incidents in order to better understand what occurred and  where appropriate  analyze where processes broke down  causing a non conformance 
this information is also reported back to many of our customers in the form of monthly service reports 
service reporting is required by an increasing number of chemical shippers 
technology we utilize mobile communications that enhance our ability to efficiently manage assets through dispatch and track our drivers and tractors 
our mobile systems handle order entry  resource planning  dispatch and communications through various network platforms including qualcomm omnitracs  edge proprietary software  and skybitz trailer tracking 
we tie all this information together using back end operational software  powersuite by tmw  allowing terminals to effectively manage their resources 
we utilize document imaging  enabling us to streamline business processes and make information accessible to customers through our website at www 
qualitydistribution 
com 
information contained on our website does not constitute a part of this form k 
these systems add to the productivity of our employees and increase integration of our equipment  which we believe results in improved value to our customers 
sales and marketing we conduct our marketing activities at both the national and local levels 
we employ geographically dispersed sales managers who market our services primarily to regional accounts 
these sales managers have extensive experience in marketing specialized tank truck transportation services 
the national sales staff concentrates on selling to a defined national account base 
in addition  portions of our marketing activities are conducted by regional sales directors in conjunction with our terminal managers and dispatchers who act as local customer service representatives 
these managers and dispatchers maintain regular contact with shippers and are well positioned to identify the changing transportation needs of customers in their respective geographic areas 
administration as of december   we operated approximately trucking terminals  tank wash facilities and iso depot services terminals throughout the united states as well as in canada 
company and affiliate terminals operate as separate profit centers and terminal managers are responsible and accountable for most operational decisions 
effective supervision requires maximum personal contact with customers and drivers 
therefore  to accomplish mutually defined operating objectives  the functions of customer service  dispatch and general administration typically rest within each terminal 
cooperation and coordination is further encouraged by our backhaul program 
from the corporate offices in tampa  florida  management monitors each terminal s operating and financial performance  safety and training record  accounts receivable and customer service efforts 
terminal managers are responsible for ensuring their terminals remain in compliance with safety  maintenance  customer service and other operating procedures 
senior corporate executives  safety department personnel and audit department personnel conduct unannounced visits to verify terminal compliance 
we strive to achieve uniform service and safety at all company and affiliate terminals  while simultaneously affording terminal managers the freedom to focus on generating business in their regions 
customers our revenue base consists of customers located throughout north america  including many fortune companies such as dow chemical company  procter gamble  ppg industries  and dupont 
in   and our largest customers accounted for   and  respectively of total trucking revenues 

table of contents competition the tank truck business is competitive and fragmented 
we compete primarily with other tank truck carriers and dedicated private fleets in various states within the united states and canada 
with respect to certain aspects of our business  we also compete with intermodal transportation and railroads 
intermodal transportation has increased in recent years 
competition for the freight transported by us is based primarily on rates and service 
management believes that we enjoy significant competitive advantages over other tank truck carriers because of our variable cost structure  overall fleet size  national terminal network and tank wash facilities 
our largest competitors are trimac transportation services ltd  superior carriers  inc  groendyke transport  inc  schneider national  inc and the dana companies 
however  there are many other smaller recognized tank truck carriers  most of which are primarily regional operators 
we also compete with other motor carriers for the services of our drivers and owner operators 
our overall size and our reputation for good relations with affiliates and owner operators have enabled us to attract qualified professional drivers and owner operators 
competition from non trucking modes of transportation and from intermodal transportation would likely increase if state or federal fuel taxes were to increase without a corresponding increase in taxes imposed upon other modes of transportation 
risk management  insurance and safety the primary insurable risks associated with our business are motor vehicle related bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation and cargo loss and damage which includes spills and chemical releases 
we maintain insurance against these risks and are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of the deductible under each policy 
we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage with an aggregate limit on the coverage in the amount of million  with a million per incident deductible 
qdi currently maintains a million per incident deductible for workers compensation insurance coverage 
we are insured over our deductible up to the statutory requirement by state and we are self insured for damage or loss to the equipment we own or lease and for cargo losses 
we employ personnel to perform compliance checks and conduct safety tests throughout our operations 
a number of safety programs are conducted that are designed to promote compliance with rules and regulations and to reduce accidents and cargo claims 
these programs include training programs  driver recognition programs  safety awards  driver safety meetings  distribution of safety bulletins to drivers and participation in national safety associations 
environmental matters it is our policy to comply with all applicable environmental  safety  and health laws 
we also are committed to the principles of responsible care  an international chemical industry initiative to enhance the industry s responsible management of chemicals 
we have obtained independent certification that our management system is in place and functions according to professional standards and we continue to evaluate and continuously improve our responsible care management system performance 
our activities involve the handling  transportation and storage of bulk chemicals  both liquid and dry  many of which are classified as hazardous materials or hazardous substances 
our tank wash and terminal operations engage in the generation  storage  discharge and disposal of wastewater that may contain hazardous substances  the inventory and use of cleaning materials that may contain hazardous substances and the control and discharge 
table of contents of storm water from industrial sites 
in addition  we may store diesel fuel  materials containing oil and other hazardous products at our terminals 
as such  we and others who operate in our industry are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulation by us federal  state and local agencies as well as foreign governmental authorities 
environmental laws and regulations are complex  and address emissions to the air  discharge onto land or water  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
these laws change frequently and generally require us to obtain and maintain various licenses and permits 
environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time  and most provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
under certain of these laws  we could also be subject to allegations of liability for the activities of our affiliates or owner operators 
we are potentially subject to strict  joint and several liability for investigating and rectifying the consequences of spills and other releases of such substances 
from time to time  we have incurred remedial costs and regulatory penalties with respect to chemical or wastewater spills and releases at our facilities and on the road  and  notwithstanding the existence of our environmental management program  we cannot assure that such obligations will not be incurred in the future  predict with certainty the extent of future liabilities and costs under environmental  health  and safety laws  or assure that such liabilities will not result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flow 
we have established reserves for remediation expenses at known contamination sites when it is probable that such efforts will be required of us and the related expenses can be reasonably estimated 
additional information about our reserves  our estimates underlying them and the known contamination sites may be found at note to our consolidated financial statements contained herein  commitments and contingencies environmental matters 
we have also incurred in the past  and expect to incur in the future  capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance for current and planned operations 
such expenditures are generally included in our overall capital and operating budgets and are not accounted for separately 
however  we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws in conducting current and planned operations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
reserves our policy is to accrue remediation expenses when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related expenses can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of costs for future environmental compliance and remediation may be adversely affected by such factors as changes in environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of currently unknown potential remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the potentially responsible parties under the applicable statutes 
the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
as of december  and december   we had reserves in the amount of million and million  respectively  for all environmental matters of which the more significant are discussed below 
the balances presented include both long term and current environmental reserves 
we expect these environmental obligations to be paid over the next five years 
additions to the environmental liability reserves are classified on the consolidated statements of operations within the selling and administrative category 
property contamination liabilities we have been named as or are alleged to be a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla and similar state laws at approximately sites 
at two of the sites  we will be participating in the initial studies to determine site remediation objectives 
since our overall liability cannot be estimated at this time  we have set reserves for 
table of contents only the initial remedial investigation phase 
at of the sites  we are one of many parties with alleged liability and are negotiating with federal  state or private parties on the scope of our obligations  if any 
at four of the sites  we have explicitly denied any liability and since there has been no subsequent demand for payment we have not established a reserve for these matters 
at two of the sites  we have recently settled our obligations 
we have estimated future expenditures for these off site multi party environmental matters to be in the range of million to million 
at six sites  we are the only responsible party and are in the process of conducting investigations and or remediation projects 
four of these projects relate to operations conducted by chemical leaman corporation and its subsidiaries clc prior to our acquisition of and merger with clc in these four sites are bridgeport  new jersey  william dick  pennsylvania  tonawanda  new york  and scary creek  west virginia 
the remaining two investigations and potential remediation were triggered by the new jersey industrial site remediation act isra  which requires such investigations and remediation following the sale of industrial facilities 
each of these sites is discussed in more detail below 
we have estimated future expenditures for these six properties to be in the range of million to million 
bridgeport  new jersey qdi is required under the terms of two federal consent decrees to perform remediation at this operating truck terminal and tank wash site 
clc entered into consent orders with the us environmental protection agency usepa in may for the treatment of groundwater and in october for the removal of contamination in the wetlands 
in addition  we were required to assess the removal of contaminated soils 
the groundwater treatment remedy negotiated with usepa calls for a treatment facility for in place treatment of groundwater contamination and a local discharge 
treatment facility construction was completed in early after various start up issues  we expect the treatment facility to begin operating in wetlands contamination has been remediated with localized restoration expected to be completed in in regard to contaminated soils  we believe that usepa is now in the process of finalizing a feasibility study for the limited areas that show contamination and warrant additional investigation or work 
we have estimated expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
william dick  pennsylvania clc entered into a consent order with the pennsylvania dep and usepa in october obligating it to provide a replacement water supply to area residents  treat contaminated groundwater  and perform remediation of contaminated soils at this former wastewater disposal site 
the replacement water supply is complete 
we completed construction of a treatment facility with local discharge for groundwater treatment in the fourth quarter of plant start up issues are on going 
the agencies have approved a contaminated soils remedy  which requires both thermal treatment of contaminated soils and treatment of residuals via soil vapor extraction 
the remedy expanded to include off site shipment of contaminated soils 
soil treatment was completed in september site sampling has been conducted and the results indicate that the soil clean up objectives have not been fully achieved 
negotiations are on going with usepa over further remedial actions that may be needed at the site 
we have estimated expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
other properties scary creek  west virginia clc received a clean up notice from the state environmental authority in august the state and we have agreed that remediation can be conducted under the state s voluntary clean up program instead of the state superfund enforcement program 
we are currently completing the originally planned remedial investigation and the additional site investigation work 

table of contents tonawanda  new york clc entered into a consent order with the new york department of environmental conservation on june  obligating it to perform soil and groundwater remediation at this former truck terminal and tank wash site 
we have completed a remedial investigation and a feasibility study 
the state issued a record of decision in may the site is currently in remedial design phase 
isra new jersey facilities we are obliged to conduct investigations and remediation at two current or former new jersey tank wash and terminal sites pursuant to the state s industrial sites remediation act  which requires such remediation following the sale of facilities after these sites are in the process of remedial investigation with projections set in contemplation of limited soil remediation expense for contaminated areas 
the former owner of a third site has agreed to take responsibility for it so we are not currently taking action under isra for the site 
we have estimated future expenditures for scary creek  tonawanda and isra to be in the range of million to million 
other legal matters we are from time to time involved in routine litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
we believe that no such routine litigation currently pending against us  if adversely determined  would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
motor carrier regulation as a motor carrier  we are subject to regulation by the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa  and the surface transportation board  or stb  both of which are units of the department of transportation dot 
the fmcsa enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations and performs certain functions relating to such matters as motor carrier registration  cargo and liability insurance  extension of credit to motor carrier customers  and leasing of equipment by motor carriers from owner operators 
the stb has authority to resolve certain types of pricing disputes and authorize certain types of intercarrier agreements 
there are additional regulations specifically relating to the tank truck industry  including testing and specifications of equipment and product handling requirements 
we may transport most types of freight to and from any point in the united states over any route selected by us 
the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services 
some of these possible changes may include increasingly stringent environmental regulations  increasing control over the transportation of hazardous materials  changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period of time  mandatory onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size 
in addition  our tank wash facilities are subject to stringent local  state and federal environmental regulation 
interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the dot 
to a large degree  intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to safety and hazardous material transportation regulations that mirror federal regulations 
such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations 
dot regulations mandate drug and alcohol testing of drivers and other safety personnel 
title vi of the federal aviation administration authorization act of  generally prohibits individual states  political subdivisions thereof and combinations of states from regulating price  entry  routes or service levels of most motor carriers 
however  the states retained the right to continue to require certification of carriers  based upon two primary fitness criteria safety and insurance and retained certain other limited regulatory rights 
prior to january   we held intra state authority in several states 
since that date  we have either been grandfathered or have obtained the necessary certification to continue to operate in those states 
in states in which we were not previously authorized to operate intra state  we have obtained certificates or permits allowing us to operate 

table of contents we are subject to compliance with cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration and by the department of homeland security  including regulation by the new bureau of customs and border protection 
we believe that we will be able to comply with pending bureau of customs and border protection rules  which will require pre notification of cross border shipments  with no material effect on our operations 
we are also subject to the motor carrier laws of canada and mexico 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced including proposals to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels  which may increase our costs and adversely impact the recruitment of drivers 
we cannot predict whether  or in what form  any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted 
seasonality due to the nature of our customers business  our revenues generally decline during winter months  namely the first and fourth fiscal quarters and over holidays 
highway transportation can be adversely affected depending upon the severity of the weather in various sections of the country during the winter months 
our operating expenses also have been somewhat higher in the winter months  due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency  increased utility costs and increased maintenance costs of equipment in colder months

risk factors risks related to our business our business is subject to general and industry specific economic factors that are largely out of our control and could affect our operations and profitability 
our business is dependent on various economic factors over which we have little control  that include the availability of qualified drivers  access to the credit and capital markets  changes in regulations concerning shipment and storage of material we transport and depot  increases in fuel taxes and tolls  interest rate fluctuations  excess capacity in the tank trucking industry  changes in license and regulatory fees  potential disruptions at us ports of entry  downturns in customers business cycles  reductions in customers shipping requirements  and 
table of contents the us economy generally 
as a result  we may experience periods of overcapacity  declining prices  lower profit margins  and less availability of cash in the future 
we have a large number of customers in the chemical processing and consumer goods industries 
if these customers experience fluctuations in their business activity due to an economic downturn  work stoppages or other industry conditions  the volume of freight transported by us or container services provided by us on behalf of those customers may decrease 
the trucking industry has recently experienced a slowdown due to lower demand resulting from slowing economic conditions 
our substantial leverage and restrictions contained in our debt agreements  including our credit facility and our indentures  could hamper our operations 
at december   we had consolidated long term indebtedness and capital lease obligations  including current maturities  of million 
the amount of our indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following using a portion of our cash flow to pay interest on our indebtedness will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other business activities  it increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  it limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  it limits our ability to exploit business opportunities  and it limits our operational flexibility  including our ability to borrow additional funds 
in addition  covenants in our debt agreements limit the use of proceeds from our ordinary operations and from extraordinary transactions 
these limits may require us to apply proceeds in a certain manner or prohibit us from utilizing the proceeds in our operations or from prepaying or retiring indebtedness that we desire 
our variable interest rate debt was million as of december  therefore  increases in market rates of interest will increase our interest expense  which would decrease our earnings 
a increase in the interest rate for our variable debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
recent turmoil in the credit and capital markets and in the financial services industry may increase our borrowing costs and may negatively impact our liquidity 
recently  the credit markets  capital markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  they may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to borrow money to finance our operations from our existing lenders under our bank credit agreements or obtain credit from trade creditors were to be impaired 
we may also be unable to refinance existing indebtedness in the capital markets if we desire or to do so only at unfavorable rates as a result of capital markets turmoil 
in addition  the recent economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers ability to finance their operations  which may negatively impact our business and results of operations 
one consequence of these upheavals has been sudden and dramatic changes in libor 
at december   million in principal amount of our outstanding borrowings have interest based solely or alternatively on a margin over libor 
increases in libor could therefore materially increase the cost of our borrowings 
in addition  capital markets have recently experienced significant volatility and disruption 
a 
table of contents majority of our existing indebtedness was sold through capital markets transactions 
we anticipate that the capital markets could be a source of refinancing of our existing indebtedness in the future 
this source of refinancing may not be available if capital markets volatility and disruption continues  which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
loss of affiliates and owner operators could adversely affect our operations and profitability 
we rely on participants in our affiliate program and independent owner operators 
a reduction in the number of owner operators  whether due to capital requirements related to the expense of obtaining  operating and maintaining equipment or for other reasons  could have a negative effect on our operations and profitability 
similarly the loss of our more robust affiliates could adversely affect our profitability 
contracts with affiliates are for various terms and contracts with owner operators may be terminated by either party on short notice 
although affiliates and owner operators are responsible for paying for their own equipment and other operating costs  significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek a higher percentage of the revenue generated if we are unable to increase our rates commensurately 
conversely  a continued decline in the rates we pay to our affiliates and owner operators could adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing affiliates and owner operators and attract new affiliates  owner operators and drivers 
we are self insured and have exposure to certain claims and are subject to the insurance marketplace  all of which could affect our profitability 
the primary accident risks associated with our business are motor vehicle related bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation claims  cargo loss and damage  and general liability claims 
we currently maintain insurance for motor vehicle related bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  owner operators and affiliates  workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers  and general liability claims 
our insurance program includes a self insured deductible of million per incident for bodily injury and property damage and a million deductible for workers compensation 
in addition  we currently maintain insurance policies with a total limit of million 
the million deductible per incident could adversely affect our profitability  particularly in the event of an increase in the number or severity of incidents 
additionally  we are self insured for damage to the equipment that we own and lease  for cargo losses  and for non trucking pollution legal liability and such self insurance is not subject to any maximum limitation 
we extend insurance coverage to our affiliates for i motor vehicle related bodily injury  ii property damage  iii general liability coverage  and iv cargo loss and damage 
under this extended coverage  affiliates are responsible for only a small portion of the applicable deductibles 
we are subject to changing conditions and pricing in the insurance marketplace and we cannot assure you that the cost or availability of various types of insurance may not change dramatically in the future 
to the extent these costs cannot be passed on to our customers in increased freight rates  increases in insurance costs could reduce our future profitability and cash flow 

table of contents the trucking industry is subject to regulation  and changes in trucking regulations may increase costs 
as a motor carrier  we are subject to regulation by the federal motor carrier safety administration  or fmcsa  and the us department of transportation or dot  and by various state  federal and provincial agencies 
these regulatory authorities exercise broad powers governing activities such as operating authority  safety  hours of service  hazardous materials transportation  financial reporting and acquisitions 
there are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry  including testing and specification of equipment  product handling requirements and drug testing of drivers 
the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services 
possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations  increasing control over the transportation of hazardous materials  changes in the hours of service regulations  which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period  onboard black box recorder devices  requirements leading to accelerated purchases of new trailers  mandatory limits on vehicle weight and size  and mandatory regulations imposed by the department of homeland security 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced  including proposals to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels  which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers 
increased unionization could increase our operating costs or constrain operating flexibility 
although only approximately of our driver workforce  including owner operators and employees of affiliates  were subject to collective bargaining agreements at december   unions such as the international brotherhood of teamsters have traditionally been active in the us trucking industry 
unionized workers could disrupt our operations by strike  work stoppage or other slowdown 
in addition  our non union workforce has been subject to unionization efforts in the past  and we could be subject to future unionization 
increased unionization of our workforce could result in higher compensation and working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility 
our operations involve hazardous materials  which could create environmental liabilities 
our activities  particularly those relating to our handling  transporting and storage of bulk chemicals  are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulation by governmental authorities in the united states as well as foreign governmental authorities 
among other things  those environmental laws address emissions to the air  discharges to land or water  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials  and the health and safety of our employees 
these laws generally require us to obtain and maintain various licenses and permits 
most environmental laws provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations 
environmental laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
there can be no assurance that violations of such laws or regulations will not be identified or occur in the future  or that such laws and regulations will not change in a manner that could impose material costs on us 
as a handler of hazardous substances  we are potentially subject to strict  joint and several liability for investigating and rectifying the consequences of spills and other environmental releases of these substances 
we 
table of contents have incurred remedial costs and regulatory penalties for chemical or wastewater spills and releases at our facilities or over the road  and  notwithstanding the existence of our environmental management program and insurance applicable to these risks  we expect that additional similar obligations will be incurred in the future 
as a result of environmental studies conducted at our facilities or at third party sites  we have identified environmental contamination at certain sites that will require remediation and we are currently conducting investigation and remediation projects at eight of our facilities 
future liabilities and costs under environmental  health  and safety laws are not easily predicted  and such liabilities could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or business reputation 
in addition  we have been named a potentially responsible party at various sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of our current reserves provided for these sites may prove insufficient  which would result in future charges against earnings 
further  we could be named a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites could be material 
potential disruptions at us ports of entry could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any disruption of the delivery of iso tank containers to those ports where we do business would reduce the number of iso tank containers that we transport  store  clean or maintain 
this reduced activity may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
if fuel prices increase significantly  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are subject to risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
political events in the middle east  venezuela  and elsewhere  as well as hurricanes and other weather related events  also may cause the price of fuel to increase 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have recovered the majority of the increases in fuel prices from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected may not always fully offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
to the extent fuel surcharges are insufficient to offset our fuel costs  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
loss of qualified drivers or other personnel could limit our growth and negatively affect operations 
during periods of high trucking volumes  there is substantial competition for qualified drivers in the trucking industry 
furthermore  certain geographic areas have a greater shortage of qualified drivers than other areas 
we operate in many of the geographic areas where there have been driver shortages in the past and have turned down new business opportunities as a result of the lack of qualified new drivers 
difficulty in attracting qualified personnel  particularly qualified drivers  could require us to increase driver compensation  forego available customer opportunities and underutilize the tractors and trailers in our network 
these actions could result in increased costs and decreased revenues 
in addition  we may not be able to recruit other qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of one or more significant customers may adversely affect our business 
we are dependent upon a limited number of large customers 
our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues during in particular  our largest customer  dow chemical company  accounted for of our total qci revenues during the loss of dow chemical company or one or more of our other major customers  or a material reduction in services performed for such customers  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents our business may be harmed by terrorist attacks  future war or anti terrorism measures 
in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september   federal  state and municipal authorities have implemented and are implementing various security measures  including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks and fingerprinting of drivers in connection with new hazardous materials endorsements on their licenses 
such existing measures and future measures may have significant costs associated with them which a motor carrier is forced to bear 
moreover  large trucks carrying toxic chemicals are a potential terrorist target  and we will be obligated to take measures  including possible capital expenditures  to harden our trucks 
in addition  the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could continue to increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future 
we depend on members of our senior management 
we believe that our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to operate profitably depends in large part on the continued employment of our senior management team 
if members of senior management become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business or financial results could be adversely affected 
our long lived assets are subject to potential asset impairment a significant portion of our assets consist of goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately million  or approximately of our total assets 
in addition  net property and equipment totaled approximately million  or approximately of our total assets 
we review for potential goodwill impairment on an annual basis as part of our goodwill impairment testing in the second quarter of each year  and more often  if a triggering event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists 
in addition  we test for the recoverability of long lived assets at year end  and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
the annual goodwill impairment review performed in june indicated no goodwill impairments 
no impairment charges were recorded during if actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations  the company could incur future unanticipated impairment charges 
our restructuring involves risks to our business operations and may not reduce our costs 
during  we eliminated non driver positions  consolidated and closed under performing company terminals and implemented certain contract terminations 
these steps have placed  and will continue to place  pressures on our management  administrative and operational infrastructure as well as on our results of operations 
employees that departed in connection with the restructuring possessed knowledge of our business  skills and relationships with our customers  affiliates  drivers and other employees that were not replaced 
as a result  our remaining employees may be required to serve new operational roles in which they have limited experience  which may reduce employee satisfaction and productivity 
new relationships may also reduce customer  affiliate or driver satisfaction 
additionally  our restructuring plans and related efforts may divert management s and other employee s attention from other business concerns 
due to the restructuring  we took pre tax charges in which represent severance related costs and costs associated with lease and contract terminations 
the majority of these costs were cash expenditures paid during 
table of contents or costs that we expect to pay in the future 
actual costs may exceed our estimates 
furthermore  we have formulated this restructuring plan with the goal of reducing our future operating expenses 
our future operating expenses may not be reduced as we expect  or reductions may be offset in the future by other expenses 
in addition  risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and or operating results 
interests of apollo may conflict with your interests 
at march   apollo and its affiliated funds owned or controlled approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  apollo can influence substantially all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as acquisitions  the ability to block an unsolicited tender offer and any other matter requiring a vote of shareholders 
the interests of apollo may conflict with your interests 
for example  if we encounter financial difficulties  or are unable to pay our debts as they mature  apollo may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions  divestitures  financings or other transactions that  in their judgment  could enhance their equity investment  even though these transactions might involve risk to our shareholders or debt holders 
similarly  if our financial performance and creditworthiness significantly improve in the future  apollo may have an interest in pursuing reorganizations  restructurings  or other transactions that could increase our leverage or impair our creditworthiness or otherwise  in their judgment  enhance apollo s equity investment in qdi  even though these transactions might involve risk to our shareholders or debtholders 
we may be unable to identify potential acquisition candidates or realize the intended benefits of consummated acquisitions 
we evaluate potential acquisitions from time to time  some of which could be material  and engage in discussions with acquisition candidates 
we cannot assure you that suitable acquisition candidates will be identified and acquired in the future  that the financing of any such acquisition will be available on satisfactory terms  that we will be able to complete any such acquisition or that we will be able to accomplish our strategic objectives as a result of any such acquisition 
nor can we assure you that our past acquisitions  including our acquisition of boasso  will be successfully received by customers or achieve their intended benefits 
often acquisitions are undertaken to improve operating results of either or both of the acquirer or the acquired company  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in this regard 
we may be held liable for risks and liabilities including for environmental related costs or liabilities as a result of acquisitions which we are not aware of at the present time  some of which may not have been discoverable from our due diligence efforts 
we will encounter various risks in acquiring other companies  including the possible inability to integrate an acquired business into our operations  diversion of management s attention and unanticipated problems or liabilities  some or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our common stock we have a majority shareholder who can substantially influence the outcome of all matters voted upon by our shareholders and prevent actions which a shareholder may otherwise view favorably 
as of march   apollo and its affiliated funds owned or controlled approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  apollo can influence substantially all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as acquisitions  the ability to block an unsolicited tender offer and any other matter requiring a vote of shareholders 
this concentration of ownership could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination which a shareholder  may otherwise view favorably 

table of contents our ability to issue blank check preferred stock and florida law may prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and florida law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares in order to control a takeover attempt which the board viewed unfavorably  elimination of the voting rights of shareholders with respect to shares that are acquired without prior board approval that would otherwise entitle such shareholder to exercise certain amounts of voting power in the election of directors  and prohibition on business combinations with interested shareholders unless particular conditions are met 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing shareholders of a large number of shares of our common stock 
these sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell additional equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of march   there are approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
approximately million shares of common stock are restricted securities as defined in rule under the securities act of or are held by affiliates 
in addition  as of march   we have million shares of common stock registered for issuance under our stock option plan 
options representing million shares were outstanding as of march  we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock 
we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the agreements and indentures governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to pay dividends 
accordingly  the price of our common stock must appreciate in order to realize a gain on one s investment 
this may not occur

overview we operate the largest for hire chemical bulk tank truck network in north america based on bulk service revenues  and we believe we have more than twice the revenues of our closest competitor in our primary chemical bulk transport market in the us the bulk tank truck market in north america includes all products shipped by bulk tank truck carriers and consists primarily of liquid and dry bulk chemicals which includes plastics and bulk dry and liquid food grade products 
we primarily transport a broad range of chemical products and provide our customers with tank wash facilities  logistics and other value added services 
we are a core carrier for many of the fortune companies engaged in chemical processing  including dow chemical  procter gamble  arclin usa  ppg industries and ashland chemical company  and we provide services to most of the top chemical producers with us operations 
our revenue is principally a function of the volume of shipments by the bulk chemical industry  the number of miles driven per load  our market share  and the allocation of shipments between tank truck transportation and other modes of transportation such as rail 
the volume of shipments of chemical products is  in turn  affected by many other industries  including consumer and industrial products  automotive  paints and coatings  and paper  and tends to vary with changing economic conditions 
economic conditions and differences among the laws and currencies of nations may impact the volume of shipments imported into the united states 
additionally  we provide leasing  tank cleaning  logistics and transloading services 
our bulk service network consists primarily of company operated terminals  independently owned third party affiliate terminals and independent owner operator drivers 
affiliates are independent companies we contract with to operate trucking terminals and tank washes exclusively on our behalf in defined markets 
the affiliates provide the capital necessary to service their contracted business and are also responsible for most of the operating costs associated with servicing the contracted business 
owner operators are generally individual drivers who own or lease their tractors and agree to drive exclusively for us and our affiliate partners 
we believe the use of affiliates and independent owner operators provides the following key competitive advantages to us in the marketplace locally owned and operated affiliate terminals can provide superior  tailored customer service 
affiliates and independent owner operators are paid a fixed  contractual percentage of revenue for each load they transport creating a variable cost structure that mitigates against cyclical downturns 
reliance on affiliate and independent owner operators creates an asset light business model that generally reduces our capital investment 
in  we expect to consolidate certain company operated terminals  and to transition other company operated terminals to affiliates 
we expect these actions to result in a larger portion of our revenue being generated by affiliates 
we believe these actions will reduce certain fixed costs and provide a more variable cost structure in our weakened economy 
we believe the most significant factors relevant to our future business growth are the ability to i obtain additional business from existing customers  ii add new customers and iii recruit and retain drivers 
while a number of our customers operate their own private tank truck fleets and many of our customers source some of 
table of contents their logistics needs with rail  we expect our customers to continue to outsource a greater proportion of their logistics needs to full service tank truck carriers 
as a result of our leading market position  strong customer relationships and flexible business model  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from customers seeking consolidation of their shipping relationships and those opting to outsource a greater portion of their logistics needs to third party tank truck carriers 
in december we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of boasso america corporation boasso for an aggregate purchase price of i million in cash less the outstanding long term indebtedness of boasso  subject to a working capital adjustment  and ii a million promissory note with a two year maturity for the benefit of boasso s principal stockholder  walter j 
boasso the boasso note excluding fees and direct costs 
boasso is the leading provider of international organization for standardization  or iso  tank container transportation and depot services in north america 
the iso tank container business generally provides services that facilitate the global movement of liquid and dry bulk chemicals  pharmaceuticals and food grade products 
the iso tank container transportation market has experienced significant recent growth as chemical manufacturers move towards greater utilization of iso tank containers to efficiently transport their products around the world via sea  land and air 
our operations strategy we are focused on operating our business more efficiently and building a solid infrastructure in order to position ourselves for growth once the economic environment starts to improve 
our cost initiatives implemented in and early are providing us with a competitive cost structure 
we are pursuing less cyclical and less seasonal products and growing a more diversified portfolio of business 
we are focusing on yield management by reviewing high volume lanes in order to identify opportunities for re pricing or exiting business  determining which lanes are profitable for us and improving lane density on reloadable freight 
customer service is at the forefront and will be a differentiator for us in the long run 
these initiatives as described below have gained momentum and have positioned us to leverage our strengths in order to capitalize on the market opportunities that lie ahead 
opportunistic affiliate conversions and company terminal consolidations 
we intend to continue to focus on a less capital intensive business model based on affiliates and owner operators 
we continually evaluate our mix of affiliate and company terminals to optimize customer service  revenue growth  profitability and return on investment 
in situations where an efficient and profitable affiliate can absorb a less profitable company terminal  we may consolidate the two operations under the affiliate 
continued focus on safety and training 
we have made safety the main focus of our organization 
we implemented several comprehensive process improvement programs to further identify and implement opportunities for sustainable safety improvement 
tangible results of this focus have already manifested themselves in a substantial decrease in preventable events and claim frequency 
we also redesigned our driver training program and updated our online training system to make safety awareness training portable and available to the driver s  dispatchers and terminal managers via the internet 
qdi is committed to conduct its operations in a manner that protects our employees  surrounding communities  customers  and the environment 
as a member of the american chemistry council acc and partner of responsible care  it is our goal to improve the quality of our service and the level of safety 
participation in responsible care is mandatory for all acc member companies 
qdi is only one of six bulk transportation service providers that have reported compliance with responsible care carrier certification management system  which determines applicability and addresses the requirements of laws  regulations  company and other requirements regarding the environmental  health  safety and security of its operations 
we have obtained independent certification 
table of contents that our management system is in place and functions according to professional standards and we continue to evaluate and continuously improve our responsible care management system performance 
focus on driver recruitment and retention 
our recruitment and retention effort is focused on providing drivers a welcoming opportunity with competitive compensation  an emphasis on professional development and an understanding that most drivers first priority is getting home safely to their families 
over the four year period ended december   we have experienced a decline in driver turnover which we believe is half of the reported truckload industry average 
we continue in our commitment to being a driver focused company that provides both technical support and personal respect to our drivers 
we offer competitive compensation  encourage input from our drivers when making business decisions  and utilize full time customer service professionals who field inbound calls and emails via our dedicated ask tampa link provided on each company issued blackberry  to ensure driver satisfaction 
our driver organization contains field based recruiters who augment the friendly  small business environment provided by our business model 
expand scope of service capabilities 
we plan to continue to expand the scope of our service capabilities in order to serve the growing needs of our customer base 
as our customers continue to focus on their core businesses  we believe that they will increasingly rely on primary service transportation companies to provide value added services such as intermodal  tank cleaning and logistics services 
we are a market leader in the iso tank container transportation and depot services business in north america 
we believe that growing our iso tank container depot business offers us the opportunity to expand our service offerings to many of our existing customers and to capitalize on this growing segment which is being driven by the trend towards the globalization of petro chemical manufacturing capacity 
optimize network 
we have implemented key initiatives expected to increase profitability by minimizing the number of empty miles driven by our drivers 
we are increasing the visibility of reloadable freight to our affiliate and company terminals to maximize our reload potential 
this allows terminals to increase the utilization of our combined assets and pursue additional revenue opportunities in their respective markets with competitive rates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies that impact the financial statements  some of which are based on management s best estimates available at the time of preparation 
actual future experience may differ from these estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment expenditures  including tractor and trailer rebuilds that extend the useful lives of such equipment  are capitalized and recorded at cost 
for financial statement purposes  these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets to an estimated salvage value 
the asset lives used are presented in the following table average lives in years buildings and improvements tractors and terminal equipment trailers furniture and fixtures other equipment 
table of contents tractor and trailer rebuilds  which are recurring in nature and extend the lives of the related assets  are capitalized and depreciated over the period of extension  generally to years  based on the type and extent of these rebuilds 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred 
management estimates the useful lives of these assets based on historical trends and the age of the assets when placed in service 
any changes in the actual lives could result in material changes in the net book value of these assets 
additionally  we estimate the salvage values of these assets based on historical sales or disposals  and any changes in the actual salvage values could also affect the net book value of these assets 
furthermore  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in the business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated 
if the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions in projecting future cash flows  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the amount of any write offs for impairment 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually during the second quarter with a measurement date of june  or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we have identified three reporting units trucking  container services and other 
our evaluation of goodwill is measured through a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value is determined using two valuation approaches a market approach and an income approach 
the market approach considers our financial condition and operating performance relative to those of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business 
the income approach expresses value in terms of the present value of future anticipated income discounted for risk 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
we determined no impairment to have occurred as of june   since the calculated fair value exceeded the carrying amount 
deferred tax asset we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by sfas no 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance that is recorded or released against our deferred tax assets 
during  we released approximately million of our deferred tax valuation allowance based on our assessment that it was more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realizable based on income projections of future taxable income and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards 
these estimates of projected taxable income include price and volume increases as well as expected expansion of market share 
these projections are based on assumptions which management believes to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results although the actual results achieved may differ materially from these projections 
we continue to evaluate quarterly  the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of net deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
included in this assessment are estimates of projected future taxable income 
significant management judgment is required in this process and although realization is not assured  based on our assessment  we concluded it is more likely than not  such assets will continue to be realized 

table of contents at december  positive evidence included having achieved profitability for financial reporting purposes for eight consecutive quarters beginning with the first quarter of fiscal additionally  we were no longer in a us cumulative loss position at the third quarter of fiscal we determine cumulative losses on a rolling thirty six months basis 
we project both aggregate us pre tax income as well as aggregate us taxable income for the years through sufficient to absorb the million existing net operating loss carryforwards 
at december  we had an estimated million in federal net operating loss carryforwards  million in alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and million in foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the years through  while the alternative minimum tax credits may be carried forward indefinitely and the foreign tax credits may be carried forward for ten years 
we do not have a history of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused  however  we have determined based on the weight of available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion of our million foreign tax credits may not be realized 
as a result we have established a valuation allowance of million against our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset 
we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable because we are projecting positive future taxable income through sufficient to absorb the million net operating loss carryforwards 
we will continue to review our forecast quarterly in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our deferred tax assets 
any increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense 
uncertain income tax positions we account for fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
fin  using a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
environmental liabilities we have reserved for potential environmental liabilities based on the best estimates of potential clean up and remediation for known environmental sites 
we employ a staff of environmental professionals to administer all phases of our environmental programs and use outside experts where needed 
these professionals develop estimates of potential liabilities at these sites based on projected and known remediation costs 
these cost projections are determined through previous experiences with other sites and through bids from third party contractors 
management believes current reserves are reasonable based on current information 
accident claims reserves we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  owner operators and affiliates  and workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers 
this insurance includes deductibles of million per incident for bodily injury and property damage and million for workers compensation for periods after march  from september  to march   our insurance deductible was million per incident for bodily injury and property damage 
as such  we are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of these deductibles under the policy 
we are self insured for damage to the equipment we own or lease  for cargo losses and for non trucking pollution legal liability 
in developing liability reserves  we rely on professional third party claims administrators  insurance company estimates and the judgment of our own safety department personnel  and independent professional actuaries and attorneys 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trends in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management believes reserves are reasonable given known information  but as each case develops  estimates may change to reflect the effect of new information 

table of contents revenue recognition transportation revenues  including fuel surcharges and related costs are recognized on the date the freight is delivered 
other service revenues  consisting primarily of lease revenues from affiliates  owner operators and third parties  are recognized ratably over the lease period 
tank wash revenues are recognized when the wash is completed 
service revenues on insurance policies are recorded as a contractual percentage of premiums received ratably over the period that the insurance covers 
we have recognized all revenues on a gross basis as the principal and primary obligor with risk of loss in relation to our responsibility for completion of services as contracted by our customers 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by our management to arrive at the estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to owner operators and affiliates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
stock compensation plans stock compensation is determined by the assumptions required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the fair values of stock option grants are based upon the black scholes option pricing model and amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grants 
restricted stock awards are issued and measured at market value on the date of grant and related compensation expense is recognized over time using graded vesting  which accelerates compensation expense into the first two years of the four year vesting period 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock was million and million  respectively  for fiscal year as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our stock based awards 
the recognition period for the remaining unrecognized stock based compensation cost is approximately four years 
for further discussion on stock based compensation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
pension plans we maintain two noncontributory defined benefit plans resulting from a prior acquisition that cover certain full time salaried employees and certain other employees under a collective bargaining agreement 
both plans are frozen and  as such  no future benefits accrue 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates to and assumed rates of return to depending on the pension plan 
material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
we had an accumulated net pension equity charge after tax of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the higher equity charge in reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during total asset returns for both pension plans were negative approximately in the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our expectation of the long term rates of return on each asset class based on the current asset mix of the funds  considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds  plus an assumption of future inflation 
the current investment policy target asset allocation differs between our two plans  but it is between to for equities and to for bonds 
the current inflation assumption is 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 

table of contents assumed discount rates and expected return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plan 
at december   our projected benefit obligation pbo was million 
our projected net periodic pension expense is million 
a decrease in our assumed discount rate would increase our pbo to million and increase our net periodic pension expense less than million 
a increase in our assumed discount rate would decrease our pbo to million and decrease our net periodic pension expense to million 
a decrease in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would increase our net periodic pension expense to million 
a increase in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would decrease our net periodic pension expense to million 
restructuring we account for restructuring costs associated with one time termination benefits  costs associated with lease and contract terminations and other related exit activities in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we have made estimates of the costs to be incurred as part of our restructuring plan 
during the quarter ended june   we committed to a plan of restructure resulting in the termination of non driver positions and the consolidation or closure of underperforming company terminals 
we continued our plan of restructure throughout which resulted in a restructuring charge of million of which the majority related to our trucking segment 
the total restructuring charge for represents million of severance costs  million in contract termination costs and million related to other exit costs 
as of december   approximately million was accrued related to the restructuring charges  which is expected to be paid during new accounting pronouncements refer to note  significant accounting policies new accounting pronouncements and adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for were million  an increase of million or  compared to revenues 
transportation revenue decreased by million or  primarily due to a million increase from the acquired boasso operations offset by a million decrease in our pre existing business due to 
table of contents continuing softness in the housing and automotive industries and general weakening of our economy 
we had an decrease in the total number of miles driven as the average number of miles per load decreased over the prior year along with a decrease in overall loads 
other service revenue increased by million  or  compared to this increase was primarily due to a million increase in revenue generated by the acquired boasso operations 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in fuel prices  and to the acquisition of boasso  offset in part by a decrease in the total number of miles driven 
purchased transportation decreased by million  or  due primarily to a reduction in our pre existing business due to a weakened economy offset by million of expense from the acquired boasso operations 
total purchased transportation as a percentage of transportation revenue and fuel surcharge revenue decreased to in versus for the prior year due to the conversion of certain affiliate terminals to company operated terminals 
our affiliates generated of our transportation revenue and fuel surcharge revenue for compared to for the prior year 
we pay our affiliates a greater percentage of transportation revenues generated by them than is paid to company owner operators  so our purchased transportation costs will change as revenues generated by affiliates change as a percentage of total transportation revenue 
during the and periods  we paid our affiliates approximately of the transportation revenue and paid owner operators approximately of transportation revenue 
in  we expect to consolidate certain company operated terminals  and to transition other company operated terminals to affiliates 
we expect these actions to result in a larger portion of our revenue being generated by affiliates 
we believe these actions will reduce certain fixed costs and provide a more variable cost structure in our weakened economy 
compensation expense increased million  or  due primarily to million of expense from the acquired boasso operations 
in addition  we had an increase of million due to new or converted company terminals added over the prior year and million increase in healthcare costs partially offset by a reduction of approximately million from wages and payroll taxes for positions eliminated in our plan of restructure 
fuel  supplies and maintenance increased million  or  due primarily to million of expense from the acquired boasso operations  increased fuel costs of million  increased equipment maintenance of million and increased equipment lease costs of million as we increase the capacity of our equipment 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  due primarily to increased depreciation and amortization from the acquired boasso operations 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  due primarily to million of expense from the acquired boasso operations 
we also incurred an increase of million in bad debt expense in due to credit adjustments in resulting from a reduction in days sales outstanding in  and an increase of million in professional fees offset by a decrease of million of travel related costs 
insurance claims expense decreased million  or  due primarily to a reduction in the number and severity of accidents that occurred during offset by an increase of million for the acquired boasso operations 
gain on disposal of property and equipment was million in as compared to a loss of million in the gain in the current year period resulted from the sale of land not used in our business compared with a loss in the prior year resulting from the disposals of certain tank wash equipment 

table of contents in  we incurred restructuring costs of million primarily due to employee termination benefits and costs associated with lease and contract terminations and other related exit activities related to our restructuring plan 
the majority of these costs were related to our trucking operations 
we expect to incur additional restructuring costs in due to further consolidation or closure of company operated terminals 
operating income increased million  or  compared to the operating margin for was compared to for as a result of the above items 
interest expense increased by million  or  in compared to primarily due to interest on our new million of senior floating rate notes issued in december these notes  along with our entry into a new asset based loan facility in december  were issued primarily to fund the acquisition of boasso  and to repay a portion of the term loan under our previous credit facility 
in conjunction with these notes  we are incurring increased amortization of the original issue discount related to these notes 
in addition  the amortization of deferred financing costs has increased due to the refinancing of our previous revolving facility in december we wrote off debt issuance costs of million related to the partial repurchase of our senior subordinated notes in in  we wrote off million of debt issuance costs due to the refinancing of our previous revolving credit facility and term loan with our new asset based loan facility and recorded a charge of million for bridge loan commitment fees related to the boasso acquisition in gain on debt extinguishment of million resulted from the repurchase of million of our senior subordinated notes 
other income of million in resulted primarily from the settlement of an acquired pension liability of million offset by million in foreign currency conversion 
other expense in contained million of costs related to an unconsummated acquisition and refinancing activities offset by million in foreign currency conversions 
the provision for income taxes was million in as compared to a benefit from income taxes of million in the effective rate for was  which is lower than our anticipated effective rate in large part due to recording a million reduction to tax expense related to a pension adjustment 
the company s effective rate would have been higher if this pension adjustment had not been recorded 
this pension adjustment was related to an income item related to the release of a pension obligation that would never be subject to income tax 
net income was million for compared with a net loss of million for for the reasons outlined above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for were million  an increase of million or  compared to revenues 
transportation revenue increased by million or compared to the increase in transportation revenue is primarily attributable to rate increases offset by a decrease in the number of loads 
other service revenue increased by million  or in versus this was primarily due to a million increase in rental revenue  a million increase from tank wash revenue  and million due to the acquisition of boasso 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million from as a result of higher average fuel prices 
approximately of the fuel surcharge revenue is reflected in purchased transportation and was paid to our affiliates and company owner operators during while the remaining company costs offset by the fuel surcharge are reflected in fuel  supplies and maintenance 

table of contents operating expenses totaled million in  an increase of million  or from the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to a million increase in fuel  supplies and maintenance  a million increase in compensation  a million increase in insurance claims  a million increase in selling and administrative expenses and million losses from the disposals of terminal assets and sales of tractors compared to million net gains that resulted in  partially offset by a decrease of million in purchased transportation 
the decrease over the prior year in purchased transportation is primarily due in part to a shift of our transportation business from affiliates to company operations 
we pay our affiliates approximately of the transportation revenue while we pay company owner operators approximately of the transportation revenue 
since we pay our affiliates a greater percentage of revenues generated by them than is paid to company owner operators  our purchased transportation costs will decrease more as revenues generated by affiliates decrease as a percentage of total transportation revenue 
our affiliates generated of our transportation and fuel surcharge revenue in compared to for the prior year 
total purchased transportation as a percentage of transportation revenue and fuel surcharge revenue decreased to versus for the prior year due to this shift in our revenue mix 
compensation expense increased million  or primarily due to new or converted company terminals added over the prior year  and company wide compensation increases 
this increase was offset in part by a million decrease in stock compensation expense due to stock units being fully recognized in fuel  supplies and maintenance increased million  or due primarily to fuel costs associated with the shift of revenue from affiliates to company owned terminals  increased lease costs as we fund the expansion of our tractor and trailer fleet through the use of operating leases  costs associated with the purchase of tires as we expand our fleet  increased maintenance as we increase the capacity of our equipment and increased costs to clean our trailers 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  due primarily to increased depreciation for assets acquired in affiliate conversions and amortization of intangible assets resulting from increased acquisition activity in selling and administrative expenses increased million  or 
this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in bad debt expense due to credit adjustments as a result of a reduction in days sales outstanding in  a million increase in qci and qsi expenses due to affiliate conversions and new tank wash terminals and an increase in travel costs as we add more company operations in addition to increased driver recruitment costs and increased building rental and maintenance costs associated with corporate and terminal buildings 
insurance claims expense increased million  or  due primarily to the settlement of three large claims in the fourth quarter of during  we recorded a million reduction in claims on insurance policies retained by our insurance subsidiary  and million of insurance reimbursement 
loss on disposal of property and equipment was million  in as compared to a gain of million in  primarily due to the disposal of terminal assets and the sale of tractors and trailers at a loss compared to the sale of several real properties that generated million of gain with the remaining net gain generated from the sale of tractors and trailers in operating income decreased million  or  compared to the operating margin for was compared to for as a result of the above items 
interest expense increased by million  or  in compared to primarily due to the increase in borrowings to acquire boasso 
interest income decreased by million due primarily to the realization in of interest income arising from the payment in stock of two subscription notes 

table of contents we wrote off debt issuance costs of million due to the refinancing of our previous revolving credit facility and term loan with our new asset based loan facility and recorded a charge of million for bridge loan commitment fees related to the boasso acquisition in we had no such costs in other expense in contained million of costs related to an unconsummated acquisition and refinancing activities offset by million in foreign currency conversions 
other expense in contained million of expenses related to the filing of a shelf registration statement and related expenses 
the benefit from income taxes was million in as compared to a benefit from income taxes of million in the effective rate for december  was 
this rate is lower than our anticipated effective rate in large part due to recording a million valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits 
the company s effective rate would have been if this valuation allowance had not been recorded 
this change was primarily due to the release of approximately million of our million deferred tax valuation allowance in this release was due to improved operating results and the determination that it is more likely than not that expected future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets 
net loss was million for compared with net income of million for for the reasons outlined above 
segment operating results prior to  we reported our financial information as a single segment 
beginning january   we have two reportable business segments for financial reporting purposes that are distinguished primarily on the basis of services offered trucking  which consists of truckload transportation of bulk chemicals  and container services  specifically iso tank container transportation and depot services 
due to the acquisition of boasso in december  we further enhanced our scope of services in the iso tank container transportation and depot services market so that management now evaluates isolated revenues associated with these services and with trucking 
segment revenues and operating income include the allocation of fuel surcharge to the trucking segment 
the operating income reported in our segments excludes amounts reported in other operating income  such as gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment  restructuring costs  corporate and other unallocated amounts 
corporate and unallocated amounts include depreciation and amortization and other gains and losses 
although these amounts are excluded from the business segment results  they are included in reported consolidated earnings 
included in other revenues are revenues from our tank wash services and other value added services 

table of contents summarized segment operating results are as follows in thousands year ended december  change of total of total operating revenues trucking container services other revenue total operating income trucking container services other operating income total year ended december  change of total of total operating revenues trucking container services other revenue total operating income trucking container services other operating income total year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue trucking revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to due to fewer miles driven due to a weakened economy partially offset by an increase in fuel surcharge resulting from increased fuel prices in container services revenues increased million  or more than  for the year ended december  compared to due to the acquired boasso operations 
other revenue revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to due primarily to a decrease in our tank wash revenue 
operating income trucking operating income increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to cost savings initiatives offset by fewer billed miles and the conversion of affiliates to company terminals which increased facility  leasing  and maintenance costs 

table of contents container services operating income increased million  or more than  for the year ended december  compared to due to the acquired boasso operations 
other operating income operating income decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to reduced tank wash revenue

container services operating income decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to due to our entry into the container services business 
other operating income operating income decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to higher operating expenses related to tank wash terminals in exchange rates we operate in canada and mexico as well as in the united states 
our results of operations are affected by the relative strength of currencies in the countries where we operate 
approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively  was generated outside the united states 
in comparing the average exchange rates between and  the canadian dollar appreciated against the united states dollar by approximately while the mexican peso depreciated against the united states dollar by approximately 
the change in exchange rates positively impacted revenue by approximately million in the appreciation of the canadian dollar and depreciation of the mexican peso was the primary reason for the less than million net decrease in cumulative currency translation loss in shareholders equity for gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of operations from foreign currency transactions included a million gain in  a million gain in  and a million gain in risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations are discussed further in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe that our liquidity  asset light business model  and streamlined operations will enable us to weather a continued economic downturn in although miles driven were almost lower than in  we still generated positive cash flow from operations 
additionally  at december   we had over million of borrowing availability under our asset based loan facility the abl facility 
the following summarizes our cash flows for fiscal years  and as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rates net decrease increase in cash cash at beginning of period cash at end of period historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations and borrowing availability under our abl facility 
our primary cash needs consist of working capital  capital expenditures and debt service including our abl facility  our notes due notes and our senior floating rate notes due the notes 
we are focusing on i stabilizing our top line  ii increasing our borrowing availability  iii simplifying our business  and iv improving our earnings 
we incur capital expenditures for the purpose of purchasing tractors and trailers to meet our strategic needs during the year  and maintaining and improving our infrastructure 
in addition  we may from time to time repurchase or redeem our outstanding securities 
there is a trading market for the notes and the senior floating rate notes although they are not listed on any exchange 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for an aggregate purchase price of million 
during the first quarter of  we purchased an additional million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we believe that these purchases at a substantial discount to their principal amount are a good investment for us because the prices are substantially less than the amount that we would owe for the repurchased notes upon maturity  and we had adequate liquidity for such purchases 
we may from time to time repurchase or redeem additional amounts of our outstanding securities 
any repurchases or redemptions would depend upon prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors we consider important 
future repurchases or redemptions may materially impact our liquidity  future tax liability and results of operations 
we have accrued million for environmental claims and million for loss and damage claims and the timing of the cash payment for such claims fluctuates from quarter to quarter 
we generated million  million and million in net cash from operating activities in  and  respectively

liquidity we believe that  based on current operations and anticipated growth  our cash flow from operations  together with available sources of liquidity  including borrowings under the revolver  will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures  make required payments of principal and interest on our debt and capital lease obligations  including obligations under our credit agreement  and satisfy other long term contractual commitments for the next twelve months 
however  for periods extending beyond twelve months  if our operating cash flow and borrowings under the revolving portions of the abl facility are not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures  debt service and other long term contractual commitments  we would be required to seek alternative financing 
these alternatives would likely include another restructuring or refinancing of our long term debt  the sale of a portion or all of our assets or operations  or the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
if these alternatives were not available in a timely manner  or not available due to difficulties accessing credit or capital markets  or on satisfactory terms  or were not permitted under our existing agreements  we might default on some or all of our obligations 
if we default on our obligations and the debt under the indentures for the notes and notes were to be accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our indebtedness  and we might be forced into bankruptcy 
other issues while uncertainties relating to environmental  labor and other regulatory matters exist within the trucking industry  management is not aware of any trends or events likely to have a material adverse effect on liquidity or the accompanying financial statements 
our credit rating is affected by many factors  including our financial results  operating cash flows and total indebtedness 

table of contents as a holding company with no significant assets other than ownership of of qd llc s membership units  qdi also depends upon qd llc s cash flows to service our debt 
qd llc s ability to make distributions to qdi is restricted by the covenants contained in the revolving portion of our abl facility and the indentures governing the notes and notes 
however  apollo as our controlling shareholder may have an interest in pursuing reorganizations  restructurings or other transactions involving us that  in their judgment  could enhance their equity investment even though those transactions might involve increasing qd llc s leverage or impairing qd llc s creditworthiness in order to decrease qdi s leverage 
while the restrictions in the revolving portion of our abl facility cover a wide variety of arrangements that have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged transactions  the abl facility and the indentures may not afford the holders of our debt protection in all circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  restructuring  merger or similar transaction 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks from i interest rates due to our variable interest rate indebtedness  ii foreign currency fluctuations due to our international operations and iii increased commodity prices due to the diesel consumption necessary for our operations 
during the last three years  we have not held derivative instruments or engaged in other hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such risks 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our variable rate borrowings under the abl facility and the notes 
with regard to the abl facility at qd llc s option  the applicable margin for borrowings under the current asset tranche at december  was with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor borrowings 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the fixed asset tranche at december  was with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor borrowings 
the applicable margin for such borrowings will be reduced or increased based on aggregate borrowing base availability under the abl facility over the life of the abl facility 
the base rate under the abl facility is equal to the higher of the prime rate and the federal funds overnight rate plus 
the base rate for our notes is libor plus 
balance at december  interest rate at december  effect of increase in s in s abl facility senior floating rate notes m senior floating rate notes m total at december   a point increase in the current per annum interest rate for each would result in million of additional interest expense during the next year 
the foregoing calculation assumes an instantaneous one percentage point increase in the rates of all of our indebtedness and that the principal amount of each is the amount outstanding as of december  the calculation therefore does not account for the differences in the market rates upon which the interest rates of our indebtedness are based  our various options to elect the lower of two different interest rates under our borrowings or other possible actions  such as prepayment  that we might take in response to any rate increase 
foreign currency exchange rate risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
the currencies in each of the countries in which we operate affect the results of our international operations reported in united states dollars  and the value of the net assets of our international operations reported in united states dollars 

table of contents these exposures may impact future earnings or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations canada and mexico represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and of our consolidated revenue in the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
assets and liabilities for our canadian operations are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for dollar conversion 
our mexican operations use the united states dollar as their functional currency 
any foreign currency impact on translating assets and liabilities into dollars is included as a component of shareholders equity 
our revenue results for fiscal year were positively impacted by a million foreign currency movement  primarily due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profits for related to the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in the canadian dollar foreign exchange rate would have decreased our revenues by approximately million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
our inter company loans are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates primarily between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar 
based on the outstanding balance of our inter company loans at december   a change of in the exchange rate for the canadian dollar would cause a change in our foreign exchange result of less than million 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  global politics and other market factors 
in and  diesel fuel prices rose to near record levels 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
in and  a majority of fuel price fluctuations were covered through fuel surcharges
