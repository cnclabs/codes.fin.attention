readers should be cautioned that a number of important factors  including those identified above in item special note regarding forward looking statements and item a risk factors  may affect actual results and may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in any forward looking statement 
our historical results of operations may not be indicative of our future operating results

we sold our transportation management systems tms business unit in june the operating results of tms and the gain on the sale have been reclassified and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences may be material 
the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our revenue is derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process 
table of contents requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management s assumptions regarding our future operations as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated cost to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and operating profits from period to period can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
many of our contracts include provisions for increased or decreased revenue and profit based on performance against established targets 
incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based upon historical experience and other objective criteria 
if performance under such contracts were to differ from previous assumptions  current period revenues and profits would be adjusted and could fluctuate significantly 
as of december  and december   unbilled receivables included million and million  respectively  of incentive fees on certain completed satellite contracts that become due incrementally over periods of up to years  subject to the achievement of performance criteria 
certain satellite contracts require us to refund cash to the customer if performance criteria  which cover periods of up to years  are not satisfied 
through december   we have recognized approximately million of revenues under such contracts  a portion or all of which could be reversed in future periods if satellite performance criteria are not met 
we generally procure annual insurance policies that we believe would indemnify us for satellite incentive fees that are not earned and for performance refund obligations 
through december   we have recognized approximately million of estimated award fees on a contract that is subject to a final assessment at the conclusion of the contract  projected to occur in if the final award fee assessment is different than the interim assessments  we will be required to record a revenue and profit adjustment in future periods 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
cost is determined on an average cost or specific identification basis 
estimated market value is determined based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were less favorable than those previously projected by management  inventory write downs could be required 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 

table of contents we account for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the fair value of our restricted stock unit grants is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from current estimates 
we use the short cut method to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits 
we use the tax law ordering method as our policy for intra period tax allocation related to the tax attributes of stock based compensation 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and restatement related to deferred income taxes as discussed in our june  and september  quarterly reports on form q  we determined to restate certain prior period financial statements as the result of an audit of our federal income tax return by the internal revenue service irs  as further described below 
in  the irs completed an audit of our federal income tax return and proposed reductions in our federal net operating loss carryforwards nols 
as a result of the audit  we determined that our nols should be reduced by million  or million on a tax effected basis  as of december  and subsequent balance sheet dates 
at december  and  we had federal nols of million and million  respectively  before giving effect to the adjustment 
we determined that the majority of the adjustment resulted from a computational mistake that occurred in preparing our and federal income tax returns 
since the year ended december   our deferred tax assets  including our nols  had been fully offset by a valuation allowance until the year ended december  when the valuation allowance was substantially reversed 
as a result  the nol overstatement did not have any impact on our income statements or balance sheets for periods prior to due to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we had previously recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   that was comprised almost entirely of the reversal of our deferred tax valuation allowance 
as a result of the adjustment described above  we restated our income statement for the year ended december  to give effect to a million reduction in the income tax benefit  and to record the corresponding reduction in non current deferred tax assets 
the adjustment did not have any impact on our income statements for any period other than the cumulative effect of the adjustment on our balance sheet as of december  was a million reduction in non current deferred tax assets and a million increase in accumulated deficit 
the adjustment did not have any impact on our cash flow statements for any period 
based on the materiality guidelines contained in securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 materiality  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements in current year financial statements  we believe that the income tax adjustment is not material to any of our current financial statements for periods subsequent to and including the year ended december  however  we believe that the adjustment would be material to our results for the year ending december  accordingly  we determined that we would restate our through annual financial statements to record this adjustment 
we further 
table of contents determined not to amend our previously filed affected annual reports on form k because the adjustment is not material to the individual prior years financial statements contained in the most recently filed annual report on form k 
we determined instead to report restated prior year financial statements within this annual report on form k 
compared with revenues our consolidated revenues were  million  up compared to due to revenue growth in the advanced space programs and launch vehicles business segments  partially offset by lower revenues in the satellites and space systems segment 
advanced space programs segment revenues grew million  or  primarily due to increased activity on national security satellite programs and the orion human spacecraft program 
launch vehicles segment revenues grew million  or  primarily due to increased activity on missile defense and space launch vehicle contracts 
satellites and space systems segment revenues declined million  or  primarily due to decreased activity on communications satellite and science and technology satellite contracts due to the substantial completion of certain satellites since cost of revenues our cost of revenues was million in  an increase compared to million in cost of revenues includes the costs of personnel  materials  subcontractors and overhead 
the increase in cost of revenues was principally due to an increased level of contract activity that was consistent with the revenue growth discussed above in the advanced space programs and launch vehicles segments  offset by a decrease in revenues in the satellites and space systems segment 
cost of revenues in the advanced space programs segment increased million  or  in compared to cost of revenues in the launch vehicles segment increased million  or  in cost of revenues in the satellites and space systems segment decreased million  or  in research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of product research and development activities 
our research and development expenses totaled million  or of revenues  in  a million increase compared to million  or of revenues  in our launch vehicles and our advanced space programs business units are jointly engaged in a major new product development program of a medium capacity rocket called taurus ii that could substantially increase the payload capacity of our space launch vehicle platforms 
we are marketing the launch vehicle to us government and commercial customers 
we expect that the taurus ii launch vehicle will be ready for its inaugural launch by late approximately million and million of the research and development expenses in and  respectively  were attributable to the taurus ii program 
we believe that we will continue to incur significant research and development expenses over the next two to three years on the taurus ii development effort 
in the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to design  build and demonstrate a new space transportation system under a program called commercial orbital transportation services cots that has the capability to deliver cargo and supplies to the international space station 
under the agreement  nasa has agreed to pay us million in cash milestone payments  partially funding our project costs which are currently estimated to be approximately million 
we expect to complete this project in late the cots agreement is being accounted for as a best efforts research and development cost sharing arrangement 
as such  the amounts funded by nasa are recognized proportionally as an offset to our cots project research and development expenses 
through december   million of costs were incurred on the cots program  million of which were proportionally offset by nasa funding resulting in net research and development expenses of million recorded by us 

table of contents the majority of our revenues are attributable to contracts with the us government and we believe that a majority of our research and development expenses are recoverable and billable under such contracts 
charging practices relating to research and development and other costs that may be charged directly or indirectly to government contracts are subject to audit by us government agencies to determine if such costs are reasonable and allowable under government contracting regulations and accounting practices 
we are currently engaged in discussions with us government agencies regarding the allowability of research and development costs incurred in connection with our taurus ii development program 
we believe that such costs are allowable  although the us government has not yet made a determination 
if such costs were determined to be unallowable  we could be required to record revenue and profit reductions in future periods 
in  for competitive reasons  we established a self imposed ceiling on the amount of research and development costs that we would recover under our us government contracts 
although we believe that such costs would otherwise be allowable and recoverable  in  we incurred million of research and development costs in excess of our self imposed ceiling 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions  as well as bid  proposal and marketing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in as compared to due to a million decrease in general and administrative expenses partially offset by a million increase in bid and proposal expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a reduction in professional fees related to a us government investigation that was concluded in and a reduction in expenses associated with a deferred compensation plan 
the increase in bid  proposal and marketing expenses was primarily associated with contract proposal activity in pursuit of new contracts within the advanced space programs segment and the satellites and space systems segment 
in  our stock based compensation expense was million  compared to million in  primarily related to restricted stock units granted each year since the majority of these costs are reported in selling  general and administrative expenses and the remainder are reported in cost of goods sold 
investment impairment charge we recorded impairment charges of million in to record the reduction in value of our investments in auction rate securities based on our assessment that it is likely that the fair value of these securities will not fully recover in the foreseeable future 
these investments are discussed further in the section investments in auction rate securities below 
interest income and other interest income and other was million in compared to million in  consisting primarily of interest income of million and million in and  respectively  on short term invested cash balances 
the decrease in interest income in was attributable to a reduction in interest rates on our short term cash investments 
interest expense interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
these amounts are principally attributable to our million of long term debt 
income tax provision our provision for income taxes relating to income from continuing operations was million and million in and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for was as compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate in was principally due to the reversal of a million reserve related to the effective settlement of the irs audit discussed above 
our cash income tax payments  which primarily relate to alternative minimum 
table of contents taxes  were approximately and of pretax income in and  respectively  primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards that substantially offset taxable income 
discontinued operations we sold our tms business unit in june and recognized a million pre tax gain  or million after tax 
the after tax income from operations related to tms was million and million in and  respectively 
net income net income was million and million  or and diluted earnings per share  in and  respectively 
net income in and was comprised of million and million of income from continuing operations  respectively and per diluted share  and million and million of income from discontinued operations  net of tax  respectively and per diluted share 
compared with revenues our consolidated revenues were  million in  up compared to due to increased revenues in all business segments 
revenues in the advanced space programs segment increased million  or  due to contract activity on the orion program which began in late launch vehicles segment revenues increased million  or  principally due to higher target and interceptor vehicle revenues as a result of increased contract activity on target vehicle and missile defense programs 
satellites and space systems segment revenues increased million  or  resulting from growth in the communications satellites product line mainly due to activity on new contracts 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues was million in  a increase compared to million in the increase in cost of revenues was principally due to an increased level of contract activity that was consistent with the revenue growth discussed above  primarily in the advanced space programs and launch vehicles segments 
cost of revenues in the advanced space programs segment increased million  or  in compared to  primarily due to the orion program 
cost of revenues in the launch vehicles segment increased million  or  in principally due to increased contract activity on target vehicle and missile defense programs 
cost of revenues in the space systems segment increased million  or  in principally due to contract activity on new communications satellite contracts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of our self funded product research and development activities and exclude direct customer funded development activities 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
these expenses related primarily to the development of enhanced launch vehicles and satellites 
approximately million of the research and development expenses in were attributable to the taurus ii development program that began in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions  as well as bid  proposal and marketing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased marginally in compared to  whereas revenues increased significantly during these periods 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses included higher business segment general and administrative expenses and higher personnel costs compared to  partially offset by a reduction in professional fees 
bid  proposal and marketing expenses remained relatively constant in and  largely due to certain major contract proposal activities in both years 

table of contents in  our stock based compensation expense was million  compared to million in  primarily related to restricted stock units granted each year since the majority of these costs are reported in selling  general and administrative expenses and the remainder are reported in cost of goods sold 
interest income and other interest income and other was million in  compared to million in  consisting primarily of interest income of million and million in and  respectively  on short term invested cash balances 
other income in included a million gain from the liquidation of an investment 
interest expense interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
the decline in interest expense was due to a lower interest rate on our long term debt as a result of our december refinancing transaction related to our convertible notes  which is discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
debt extinguishment expense during  we recorded million of debt extinguishment expenses associated with the repurchase of substantially all of our senior notes as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
the debt extinguishment expenses consisted of million in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and million in prepayment premiums and other expenses 
income tax provision our provision for income taxes relating to income from continuing operations was million and million in and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was and in and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower effective state tax rates in our cash income tax payments  which primarily relate to alternative minimum taxes  were approximately of pretax income in both and  primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards that substantially offset taxable income 
discontinued operations the after tax income from operations for the tms business was and million in and  respectively 
net income net income was million and million  or and diluted earnings per share in and  respectively 
net income in and was comprised of million and million of income from continuing operations  respectively and diluted net income from continuing operations per share  respectively  as well as million and million of income from discontinued operations and diluted income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in and  respectively 

table of contents segment results our products and services are grouped into three reportable business segments i launch vehicles  ii satellites and space systems  and iii advanced space programs 
the operating results of tms have been reclassified and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented  accordingly  tms is no longer reported as a reportable segment 
corporate office transactions that have not been attributed to a particular segment  as well as consolidating eliminations and adjustments  are reported in corporate and other 
the following table summarizes revenues and income from operations for our reportable business segments and corporate and other in thousands years ended december  revenues launch vehicles satellites and space systems advanced space programs corporate and other total income loss from operations launch vehicles satellites and space systems advanced space programs corporate and other total corporate and other operating income consists primarily of corporate general and administrative expenses allocated to the tms business unit which we sold in compared with launch vehicles launch vehicles segment revenues grew million  or  primarily due to increased activity on missile defense and space launch vehicle contracts 
pursuant to a contract with the boeing company  we are the sole supplier of operational and test interceptor boosters for the us missile defense agency s mda ground based midcourse defense gmd program  for which our interceptor booster  a modified version of our pegasus rocket  is being used as a major operational element in the us national missile defense system 
we are also developing a boost vehicle for mda s kinetic energy interceptor kei program 
interceptor launch vehicle contracts accounted for approximately of total launch vehicles segment revenues in both and revenues from interceptor launch vehicle contracts increased million primarily due to increased activity on the gmd program 
revenues from space launch vehicle programs increased million primarily as a result of higher activity levels on the minotaur and taurus programs 
revenues in our target launch vehicle programs decreased million  primarily as a result of decreased activity on our coyote supersonic ramjet vehicle contract for the us navy 
this decrease was partially offset by increased design and production activity on our ballistic missile target programs that support missile defense systems testing 
operating income in the launch vehicles segment decreased million  or  due to unrecovered taurus ii research and development expenses  cost increases on certain space launch vehicle contracts 
table of contents and a profit adjustment related to a launch failure discussed below 
these factors were partially offset by operating income generated by increased activity on missile defense contracts 
in  for competitive reasons  we established a self imposed ceiling on the amount of research and development costs that we would recover under our us government contracts 
although we believe that such costs would otherwise be allowable and recoverable  in  we incurred million of research and development costs in excess of our self imposed ceiling 
also in  we recorded a million favorable profit adjustment as a result of the recovery of costs incurred in connection with the closure of a us government investigation 
profit from interceptor launch vehicle programs accounted for and of total segment operating income in and  respectively 
on february   our taurus xl rocket  which was carrying the orbiting carbon observatory satellite that we had built for nasa experienced a launch failure and the satellite was destroyed 
as a result of the launch failure  we will not receive a million mission success incentive that we had expected to earn and we will incur unanticipated costs to investigate the cause of the incident 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million adjustment to reduce revenue and operating profit on the taurus contract 
we believe that we will recover the million mission success incentive under an existing insurance policy and that such proceeds will be recorded in other income in the segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in the decrease in margin was largely due to the impact of the unrecovered research and development expenses and the profit adjustment associated with the taurus launch failure  partially offset by the million favorable profit adjustment recorded in connection with the closure of the u 
s government investigation mentioned above 
in addition  the profit margin in was reduced by the impact of approximately million of cost increases related to launch delays of certain space launch vehicle programs 
satellites and space systems satellites and space systems segment revenues declined million  or  primarily due to decreased activity on communications satellite and science and technology satellite contracts due to the substantial completion of certain satellites since revenues from science and technology contracts decreased million and communications satellite revenues decreased million 
communications satellite program revenues accounted for and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
operating income in the satellites and space systems segment increased million  or  despite a decrease in segment revenues  primarily due to profit growth from communications satellite contracts and our receipt of a million incentive on a completed technology satellite contract in communications satellites operating income accounted for and of total segment operating income in and  respectively 
operating profit from communications satellites increased approximately million in in spite of lower revenues as a result of improved cost controls and improved program performance in this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in  compared to in the margin improvement was primarily due to improved contract performance in on communications satellite contracts in addition to the impact of the receipt of the million incentive mentioned above 
advanced space programs advanced space programs segment revenues grew million  or  primarily due to increased activity in on national security satellite programs and the orion human spacecraft program for nasa 
the orion program accounted for and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
revenues from national security satellite programs were approximately million in  an increase of more than over  due to activity on several new contracts that began in and in late 
table of contents operating income in the advanced space programs segment increased million  or  due to increased activity on the orion contract and national security satellite contracts 
the percentage increase in operating income was somewhat lower than the increase in revenues due to the impact of a favorable profit adjustment in pertaining to the receipt of a final award fee on a completed satellite contract 
this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in this decrease in operating margin was primarily due to the impact of the profit adjustment in mentioned above 
corporate and other corporate and other revenues were comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
corporate and other operating losses in and were comprised solely of corporate general and administrative expenses allocated to the tms business unit that was sold in compared with launch vehicles launch vehicles segment revenues increased million  or  due to revenue increases in all three of the segment s major product lines 
interceptor launch vehicles contracts accounted for and of total launch vehicles segment revenues in and  respectively 
revenues from interceptor launch vehicles increased million primarily due to a ramp up of the development efforts on a demonstration vehicle test scheduled for late on the kei program  complemented by a marginal increase in gmd program activity 
revenues increased million from target launch vehicles resulting primarily from increased design and production activity on our ballistic missile target programs that support missile defense systems testing and on our coyote supersonic ramjet vehicle program for the us navy 
space launch vehicle revenues increased marginally due to higher levels of activity on taurus programs  partially offset by a reduction in pegasus and minotaur program activity 
operating income in the launch vehicles segment increased million  or  due to operating profit increases in the interceptor and target launch vehicles product lines  partially offset by a decrease in the space launch vehicles product line operating profit 
interceptor launch vehicles operating income increased primarily due to the increase in the kei program due to increased program activity 
profit from interceptor launch vehicles programs accounted for and of total segment operating income in and  respectively 
operating income from target launch vehicles increased significantly in line with the revenue growth from our ballistic missile target programs and our coyote supersonic ramjet vehicle program 
operating income from space launch vehicles decreased primarily due to lower pegasus program activity and an unfavorable profit adjustment on a pegasus contract due to cost growth in  partially offset by higher taurus income consistent with higher program activity during this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in the margin decline was due to growth in the target launch vehicles product line  which had a lower than average margin for the segment  and due to lower margins in the space launch vehicles product line resulting from the unfavorable profit adjustment mentioned above 
satellites and space systems satellites and space systems segment revenues increased million  or  principally due to significant growth in communications satellite revenues partially offset by a reduction in science and technology satellite revenues 
communications satellite contracts accounted for and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
revenues from science and technology satellite contracts declined largely due to the substantial completion of certain programs in operating income in the satellites and space systems segment increased million  or  primarily due to the growth in the communications satellites product line contract activity in this 
table of contents increase was partially offset by lower operating income from science and technology satellites due to the decline in program activity mentioned above in addition to an unfavorable profit adjustment resulting from cost growth on a contract 
communications satellites operating income accounted for and of total segment operating income in and  respectively 
the increase in communications satellites operating income was attributable to the substantial growth in program activity as well as a profit margin improvement in this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in the margin decline was primarily due to a lower operating margin in our science and technology satellites product line that included the unfavorable profit adjustment discussed previously  offset partially by an improved operating margin in in our communications satellites product line 
advanced space programs advanced space programs segment revenues increased million  or  primarily due to increased contract activity on the orion human spacecraft program for nasa which began in late the increase in orion program revenues was partially offset by a reduction in revenue resulting from the completion of an advanced satellite contract early in operating income in the advanced space programs segment increased million  or  primarily due to the increase in contract activity on the orion program 
this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to contract cost adjustments and a revised profit assessment in on the orion program 
corporate and other corporate and other revenues were comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
corporate and other operating losses in and the majority of such losses in were comprised of corporate general and administrative expenses allocated to the tms business unit 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities cash flow from operating activities in was million  as compared to million in the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash flow related to changes in assets and liabilities partially offset by a reduction in pretax income 
pretax income from continuing operations  after adjusting for a million non cash impairment charge  was million lower in as compared to changes in assets and liabilities provided million more operating cash than in  attributable mainly to a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by increases of million in accounts receivable and million in inventories 
the increases in receivables  inventory and payables resulted from growth in contract activity and related revenues and costs in our cash income tax payments  which primarily relate to alternative minimum taxes  were million and million in and  respectively 
our cash income tax payments were significantly less than our income tax provision primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards that substantially offset taxable income 
cash flow from operating activities in remained constant compared to  primarily due to an increase in deferred revenues in that did not recur in cash from operations in included an million net reduction in cash due to changes in assets and liabilities  primarily due to an million increase in receivables  partially offset by an million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increase in receivables and payables was due to the growth in contract activity and related revenues and costs in 
table of contents cash flow from investing activities we generated million of net cash from investing activities in during  we received net cash proceeds of million from the sale of the tms business unit 
in our capital expenditures totaled million 
capital expenditures increased million in as compared to due to infrastructure cost required to support the growth in business 
we used million of net cash for investing activities in this was composed of capital expenditures of million and net purchases of investments of million 
these investments are discussed further below in the section investments in auction rate securities 
we used million of net cash for investing activities in  which was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of million 
cash flow from financing activities net cash flow used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in we repurchased and retired a total of million  million and million shares of our common stock at a cost of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the share repurchase included the repurchase of million shares in connection with a debt refinancing transaction discussed below 
during  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases 
in december we issued million of convertible notes payable as discussed in more detail below 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes  together with available cash  to repurchase million of our senior notes due for million and to repurchase and retire million outstanding shares of our common stock for million 
debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the convertible notes were million  which is being amortized to interest expense over seven years 
convertible notes on december   we issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes due with interest payable semi annually each january and july the convertible notes are convertible into cash  or a combination of cash and common stock at our election  based on an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  in principal amount of the convertible notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share under certain circumstances 
at any time on or after january   the convertible notes are subject to redemption at our option  in whole or in part  for cash equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes  plus unpaid interest  if any  accrued to the redemption date 
holders of the convertible notes may require us to repurchase the convertible notes  in whole or in part  on january   january  or january   or  if a fundamental change as such term is defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes occurs  for cash equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes  plus any unpaid interest  if any  accrued to the redemption date 
credit facility in august  we entered into a five year million revolving secured credit facility the credit facility  with the option to increase the amount of the credit facility up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders commit to be a lender for such additional 
table of contents amount 
loans under the credit facility bear interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to  with the applicable margin varying according to our total leverage ratio  or at our election  at a prime rate 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
up to million of the credit facility may be reserved for letters of credit 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility  although million of letters of credit were issued under the credit facility 
accordingly  as of december   million of the credit facility was available for borrowings 
debt covenants our credit facility contains covenants limiting our ability to  among other things  pay cash dividends  incur debt or liens  redeem or repurchase our stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  make investments  merge or consolidate with others or dispose of assets 
in addition  the credit facility contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
investments in auction rate securities as of december  and  we held seven auction rate securities which are classified as available for sale securities and non current assets on our balance sheet 
these securities had an initial cost basis of million 
contractual maturities for certain of these auction rate securities are years or greater and the remaining securities have no fixed maturity 
auction rate securities are normally structured to provide liquidity through an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals 
this mechanism allows existing investors either to roll over or liquidate their holdings by selling such securities at par 
since the third quarter of and through december   the auctions  which occur approximately every days for the auction rate securities held by us  have not had sufficient buyers to cover investors sell orders  resulting in unsuccessful auctions 
these unsuccessful auctions resulted in a resetting of the interest rate paid on the securities until the next auction date  at which time the process repeated 
we estimated that the fair market value of these auction rate securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we have estimated the fair value of these securities using a discounted cash flow analysis which considered the following key inputs i the underlying structure of each security  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security  and iii the time horizon that the market value of each security could return to its cost and be sold
