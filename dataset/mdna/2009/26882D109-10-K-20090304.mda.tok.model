produced documents are made available primarily through a hosted environment  and our documatrix software allows for efficient plaintiff and defendant counsel review and data requests 
our electronic discovery customers are typically large corporations that use our products and services cooperatively with their legal counsel to manage the electronic discovery process for complex litigation matters 
the substantial increase of electronic documents in the business community has changed the dynamics of how attorneys support discovery in complex litigation matters 
according to the socha gelbmann electronic discovery survey  domestic commercial electronic discovery revenues were estimated at billion  an approximate increase from according to this same source  the market is expected to continue to grow at year over year annual rates of for  for and for due to the complexity of cases  the volume of data that are maintained electronically  and the volume of documents that are produced in all types of litigation  we anticipate that law firms will become increasingly reliant on electronic evidence management systems to organize and manage the litigation discovery process 
following is a description of the significant sources of revenue in our electronic discovery business 
fees related to the conversion of data into an organized  searchable electronic database 
the amount we earn varies primarily on the size number of documents and complexity of the engagement 
hosting fees based on the amount of data stored 
bankruptcy segment our bankruptcy business provides solutions that address the needs of chapter  chapter and chapter bankruptcy trustees to administer bankruptcy proceedings and of debtor corporations that file a plan of reorganization 
the key participants in a bankruptcy proceeding include the debtor in possession  the debtor s legal counsel  the creditors  the creditors legal counsel  and the bankruptcy judge 
chapter and chapter cases also have a professional bankruptcy trustee  who is responsible for administering the bankruptcy case 
the end user customers of our bankruptcy business are debtor corporations that file a plan of reorganization and professional bankruptcy trustees 
the executive office for united states trustees  a division of the us department of justice  appoints all bankruptcy trustees 
a united states trustee is appointed in most federal court districts and generally has responsibility for overseeing the integrity of the bankruptcy system 
the bankruptcy trustee s primary responsibilities include liquidating the debtor s assets or collecting funds from the debtor  distributing the collected funds to creditors pursuant to the 
table of contents orders of the bankruptcy court  and preparing regular status reports for the executive office for united states trustees and for the bankruptcy court 
trustees manage an entire caseload of bankruptcy cases simultaneously 
the application of chapter bankruptcy regulations has the practical effect of discouraging trustee customers from incurring direct administrative costs for computer system expenses 
as a result  we provide our chapter products and services to our trustee customers at no direct charge  and they maintain deposit accounts for bankruptcy cases under their administration at a designated banking institution 
we have marketing arrangements with various banks under which we provide the bankruptcy trustee case management software and related services and the bank provides the bankruptcy trustee with deposit related banking services

following is a description of the significant sources of revenue in our bankruptcy business 
data hosting fees and volume based fees 
case management professional service fees and other support service fees related to the administration of cases  including data conversion  claims processing  claims reconciliation  professional consulting services  and settlement administration 
deposit based fees  earned primarily on a percentage of chapter total liquidated assets placed on deposit with a designated financial institution by our trustee clients  to whom we provide  at no charge  software licenses  limited hardware and hardware maintenance  and post contract customer support services 
the fees we earn based on total liquidated assets placed on deposit by our trustee clients may vary based on fluctuations in short term interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations are somewhat mitigated by pricing arrangements with each financial institution that set ceilings and floors on the interest rates that we earn 

table of contents legal noticing services to parties of interest in bankruptcy matters  including direct notification and media campaign and advertising management in which we coordinate notification  primarily through print media outlets  to potential parties of interest for a particular client engagement 
reimbursement for costs incurred  primarily related to postage on mailing services 
settlement administration our settlement administration segment provides managed services  including legal notification  claims administration  project administration  and controlled disbursement 
key participants in this marketplace include law firms that specialize in representing class action and mass tort plaintiffs and other law firms that specialize in representing defendants 
class action and mass tort litigation is often complex and the cases  including administration of any settlement  may last several years 
the customers of our settlement administration segment are corporations that are administering the settlement or resolution of class action cases or administering projects 
we sell our services directly to those customers and other interested parties  including legal counsel  which often provide access to these customers 
during the year ended december   approximately of our consolidated revenue was derived from one large contract 
this revenue was recognized in our settlement administration segment 
revenue related to this contract is expected to decline throughout as we reach the conclusion of the contract during class action and mass tort refer to litigation in which class representatives bring a lawsuit against a defendant company or other persons on behalf of a large group of similarly affected persons 
mass tort refers to class action cases that are particularly large or prominent 
the class action and mass tort marketplace is significant  with estimated annual tort claim costs of approximately billion in  according to a study issued in by towers perrin 
administrative costs  which include costs  other than defense costs  incurred by either the insurance company or self insured entity in the administration of claims  comprise approximately of this total 
following is a description of the significant sources of revenue in our settlement administration business

reimbursement for costs incurred related to postage on mailing services 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  consolidated results of operations revenue total revenue was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared to the prior year 
a portion of our total revenue consists of reimbursement for direct costs we incur  such as postage related to document management services 
we reflect the operating revenue from these 
table of contents reimbursed direct costs as a separate line item on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
this increase directly corresponded to the increase in reimbursed direct costs 
although reimbursed operating revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our income from operations as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
operating revenue exclusive of operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs  which we refer to as operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs  was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared to the prior year 
the increase consists of a million increase in the electronic discovery segment and a million increase in the settlement administration segment  partially offset by a million decrease in the bankruptcy segment 
changes by segment are discussed below 
operating expenses direct cost of services  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared to million in the prior year 
contributing to this increase was a million increase in the cost of outside services  primarily related to telephone  mailing and temporary help services  a million increase in legal noticing  a million increase in compensation related expense  and a million increase in production supplies 
changes by segment are discussed below 
direct cost of bundled products and services  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the prior year

reimbursed direct costs increased in to million compared to million in the prior year 
this increase directly corresponded to the increase in operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs 
changes by segment are discussed below 
general and administrative costs increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the prior year 
contributing to this increase was a million increase in compensation  commission and benefits expense  primarily resulting from expanded staffing to meet client demands  a million increase in travel expense  a million increase in professional services  and a million increase in bad debt expense 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in share based compensation expense which was the result of a change in the timing of our equity compensation grants 
changes by segment are discussed below 
depreciation and software and leasehold amortization costs in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of increased software amortization expense and increased hardware depreciation largely related to investment in our electronic discovery segment 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily the result of certain customer contracts and trade names that became fully amortized during the year  partially offset by an increase in non compete amortization resulting from our second quarter acquisition of an electronic discovery business in the united kingdom 
other operating expense of million in primarily consists of million of non capitalized acquisition related expenses related to the acquisition of an electronic discovery business in the united kingdom in the second quarter of  as well as million of expenses incurred throughout related to potential acquisitions that were not completed 
the acquisition related expenses consisted of legal services  executive compensation  indirect and general costs  
table of contents accounting services  and valuation services 
partially offsetting these expenses is a million gain in related to interest rate floor options purchased during interest expense interest expense was million  compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
contributing to the decline was a million decrease in interest expense related to our credit facility  a million decrease in expense related to the value of our subordinated convertible note holders option to extend the maturity of the subordinated convertible notes from june  to june   and a million decrease in loan fee amortization 
the million decrease in credit facility interest expense resulted from our repayment and termination of the credit facility term loan and the repayment in full of the credit facility revolving loan during from the proceeds of a common stock offering in november the million decrease in loan fee amortization expense was primarily the result of the completion of the amortization of fees related to the contingent convertible subordinated debt and the credit facility term loan during during april  the holders of the contingent convertible subordinated notes exercised their right to extend the maturity of the convertible notes from june to june as a result  we will continue to pay interest  at a rate of per annum  during the extension period on any convertible notes that remain outstanding 
the holders of the convertible notes may chose at any time to convert some or all of the notes into our common shares 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this conversion right 
we estimated the fair value of the option to extend immediately prior to the note holders vote to extend and recorded a final adjustment to the fair value of the option to extend the subordinated convertible notes maturity 
we are currently amortizing the exercise date fair value of the option as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the extension 
during we recognized a reduction to interest expense of approximately million related to the amortization of the carrying value of the option to extend the maturity term subsequent to the extension date 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate was for compared with an effective rate of for the prior year 
our tax rate is generally higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to state and local taxes 
several of our subsidiaries operate in new york city and are subject to state and local tax rates which are higher than the tax rates assessed by other jurisdictions where we operate 
the increase in the effective tax rate compared with the prior year is primarily due to a larger proportion of our income being taxed in high tax rate jurisdictions and the reversal of a valuation allowance related to our united kingdom net operating loss carryforward in during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that the united kingdom net operating loss would be fully utilized within the carryforward period 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance related to the remaining net operating loss carryforward asset resulting in a lower effective tax rate in net income we had net income of million for compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
growth in our settlement administration segment  resulting from a large contract  as well as the decline in net interest expense  contributed to the increase in net income 
these increases were offset in part by the bankruptcy segment  which declined as a result of reduced short term interest rates throughout  combined with lower bankruptcy deposits 

table of contents results of operations by segment the following segment discussion is presented on a basis consistent with our segment disclosure contained in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
electronic discovery segment electronic discovery operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs in was million  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this increase is attributable to additional projects from existing clients  as well as an expansion of our client base  which resulted in an increase in hosting and processing revenue 
electronic discovery direct and administrative expenses  including reimbursed direct costs  were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
factors contributing to this increase include a million increase in compensation  commission and benefits expense  resulting from expanded staffing to support increased operating revenue  a million increase in bad debt expense  a million increase in promotional expense  a million increase in professional services  a million increase in purchased software  a million increase in building and equipment lease expense  primarily related to data center expansion  and an million increase in maintenance expense 
bankruptcy segment bankruptcy operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this slight decrease was the result of an million decline in our bankruptcy trustee fees  offset in part by an million increase in bankruptcy restructuring engagements 
revenue from our bankruptcy trustee business could continue to be lower with comparable periods if short term interest rates do not increase 
this effect could be partly mitigated by an increase in bankruptcy trustee revenue as an increase in bankruptcy filings could result in an increase in the bankruptcy trustee deposit portfolio 
noticing services depend on the timing of a case and will fluctuate from period to period 
bankruptcy direct and administrative expenses  including reimbursed direct costs  were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in compensation  commission and benefits expense  primarily due to increased headcount  a million increase in bad debt expense  resulting from several clients moving from chapter to chapter bankruptcy and additional accruals  and a million increase in outside services expense  resulting from several large noticing engagements 
settlement administration settlement administration operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs was million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this increase was due to a million increase in call center and direct mailing revenue  primarily related to a large contract  a million increase in legal notification revenue  resulting from several large class action cases  and an million increase in professional services 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in transaction processing revenue 
settlement administration direct and administrative expenses  including reimbursed direct costs  were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of a million increase in call center  outside service  and mailing supplies costs to support the large contract referenced above 
also contributing to the increase was a million increase in the cost of legal noticing that is directly related to the increase in legal 
table of contents notification revenue  and a million increase in reimbursable expenses  which is offset directly by an increase in operating revenue from reimbursable costs 
additional staffing requirements to meet client demands resulted in a million increase in compensation  commissions and benefits  and a million increase in outside services 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  consolidated results of operations revenue total revenue from operations was million in  a decrease of million  or  from the prior year 
a portion of our total revenue consists of reimbursement for direct costs we incur  such as postage related to document management services 
we reflect the operating revenue from these reimbursed direct costs as a separate line item on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
although reimbursed operating revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our income from operations as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs in was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily the result of a million decrease in bankruptcy revenue before reimbursed direct costs and a million decrease in settlement administration revenue before reimbursed direct costs  partly offset by a million increase in electronic discovery operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs 
as more fully explained under the caption significant accounting policies revenue recognition in note to our consolidated financial statements  the decrease in bankruptcy operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs is primarily attributable to the recognition  during  of approximately million of revenue  deferred beginning in october  following delivery of the final specified software upgrade pursuant to a specific arrangement that expired september  all revenue is directly related to a segment and changes in revenue by segment are discussed below 
operating expenses direct cost of services  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  was million in  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the prior year

also contributing to the increase was a million increase in travel expenses and a million increase in rent expense 
changes by segment are discussed below 

table of contents depreciation and software and leasehold amortization costs in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase primarily resulted from an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense related to purchased and internally developed software and the related hardware required to support the expansion of our electronic discovery business 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year as certain customer contract intangibles  primarily related to our settlements and claims business  and certain trade name intangibles  primarily related to our electronic discovery business  became fully amortized in other operating expenses  which include the mark to market adjustment for the purchased interest rate floor options as well as acquisition related expenses  reflect million of income for compared with million of expense for the prior year 
a portion of our bankruptcy trustee pricing is tied to short term interest rates  and an increase or decrease in the short term interest rate may result in corresponding changes in bankruptcy trustee revenue 
to mitigate our interest rate risk  during the third quarter of  we purchased libor based interest rate floors with strike prices ranging from to and a notional value of million 
these instruments were not designated as accounting hedges 
at the end of each period  we estimate the fair value of these instruments and the change in market value is recognized as a component of other operating expenses 
the adjustment for resulted in the recognition of million of income 
subsequent to december   we terminated these interest rate floor options and received cash of approximately million 
we did not recognize any acquisition related expenses during compared with million recognized in interest expense interest expense was million in  a decrease of million as compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily related to a million decrease in interest expense related to our credit facility and a million decrease in the amortization of loan fees  partly offset by a million increase in net expense related to the holders right to extend the maturity of the notes by up to three years 
the decrease in interest expense related to our credit facility is primarily due to a decrease in outstanding borrowings from million as of the beginning of to million as of september  in november  we used proceeds from a registered offering of our common shares to repay the credit facility in full 
loan amortization expense decreased as the fees related to our contingent convertible subordinated notes became fully amortized during june during april  the holders of the contingent convertible subordinated notes exercised their right to extend the maturity of the convertible notes from june to june as a result  we will continue to pay interest  at a rate of per annum  during the extension period on any notes that remain outstanding the holders of the notes may chose at any time to convert some or all of the notes into our common shares see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this conversion right 
we estimated the fair value of the option immediately prior to the note holders vote to extend and recorded a final adjustment to the fair value of the option to extend the notes maturity 
this final adjustment was recorded as a charge to interest expense  resulting in an estimated fair value expense of million during compared to an estimated fair value expense of million during we are currently amortizing the exercise date fair value of the option as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the extension  which partly offsets the increase to interest expense related to recognition of the estimated fair value of the right to extend the maturity of the contingent convertible subordinated notes

prior to  we established a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net operating loss carryforward asset 
the subsidiary generated taxable income in and we utilized a portion of the net operating loss carryforward 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that the net operating loss would be fully utilized within the carryforward period 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance related to the remaining net operating loss carryforward asset 
net income we had net income of million for compared to million for the prior year

table of contents bankruptcy segment bankruptcy operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs in was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the prior year 
as more fully explained under the caption significant accounting policies  revenue recognition in note to the consolidated financial statements  this decrease is primarily the result of our revenue recognition related to a specific arrangement in with our primary depository financial institution 
during the second quarter of  we delivered the final software upgrade specified under this arrangement 
as the only remaining undelivered element was postcontract customer support services  and as the contract terminated september   during we recognized  in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  million of revenue that had been deferred during the period october  through december  effective october   we entered into a new arrangement with this depository financial institution  this new arrangement does not include provisions related to software upgrades 
accordingly  we now recognize this revenue based on a contingent usage based revenue model and  during  we did not defer any bankruptcy revenue or recognize any previously deferred bankruptcy revenue 
also contributing to the decrease in bankruptcy operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs was a decline in average trustee deposits during compared with as a result of the decrease in bankruptcy filings during both periods

contributing to net cash provided by operating activities was net income of million and increased non cash expenses  such a depreciation and amortization and share based compensation expense  of million 
these items were partially offset by a million net use of cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the most significant change in operating assets and liabilities was a million increase in trade accounts receivable  related to a large settlement administration customer and several matters in the bankruptcy segment

enhancements to our existing software and the development of new software is essential to our continued growth  and  during  we used cash of million to fund internal costs related to the development of software for which technological feasibility had been established 
we also used cash of million to fund the acquisition of an electronic discovery business located in the united kingdom 
we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our anticipated property  equipment  and software spending for the foreseeable future 
our property  equipment and third party software purchases consisted primarily of computer related hardware  purchased software  and leasehold improvements to support the expansion of our electronic discovery business 
we believe that cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our anticipated property  equipment and software spending over the next year 
financing activities during the year ended december   we used cash to pay approximately million as a principal reduction on our deferred acquisition notes and capital lease payments  and million in closing costs as part of our amended credit facility 
this financing use of cash was partially offset by million of net proceeds from stock issued in connection with the exercise of employee stock options 
we also recognized a portion of the tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options as a financing source of cash 
as of december   our borrowings consisted of million including the fair value of the embedded option from the contingent convertible subordinated notes  which bears interest at based on the million principal amount  and approximately million of obligations related to capital leases and deferred acquisition price payments

the holders of the contingent convertible subordinated notes have the right to convert at a price of approximately per share 
if any or all notes are converted into shares of our common stock prior to the scheduled maturity of those notes  then there will be no cash requirements associated with those converted notes  other than the regular payment of interest earned prior to the conversion date 
as of december  we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our million senior revolving loan

interest on the credit facility is generally based on a spread  not to exceed basis points over the libor rate 
as of december   significant financial covenants  all as defined within our credit facility agreement  include a leverage ratio not to exceed to  a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  and a current ratio of not less than to 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
covenants contained in our credit facility and in our contingent convertible subordinated notes include limitations on acquisitions  should we pursue acquisitions in the future 
pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  we generally cannot incur indebtedness outside the credit facility  with the exceptions of capital leases and subordinated debt  with a limit of million of aggregate 
table of contents subordinated debt 
furthermore  for any acquisition we must be able to demonstrate that  on a pro forma basis  we would be in compliance with our covenants during the four quarters prior to the acquisition and bank permission must be obtained for an acquisition for which cash consideration exceeds million or total consideration exceeds million

convertible debt is included at stated value of the principal redemption and is net of the carrying value of the embedded option  which will not be paid in cash 
the holders of the contingent convertible subordinated notes have the right to convert at a price of approximately per share 
any conversion to our common stock of part or all of the convertible debt will reduce our cash obligation related to the convertible debt 
a portion of the purchase price for acquisitions was paid in the form of non interest bearing notes or below market rate notes  which were discounted using an appropriate imputed rate 
the discounts are accreted over the life of the note and each period s accretion is added to the principal of the respective note 
the amount in the above contractual obligation table includes both the notes principal  as reflected on our december  consolidated balance sheet  and all future accretion

critical accounting policies we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  share based compensation  business combinations  goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  income taxes and derivative financial instruments to be critical policies in understanding our historical and future performance 
revenue recognition we have agreements with clients pursuant to which we deliver various services each month 
following is a description of significant sources of our revenue 
fees contingent upon the month to month delivery of case management services defined by client contracts  such as claims processing  claims reconciliation  professional services  call center support  and conversion of data into an organized  searchable electronic database 
the amount we earn varies based primarily on the size and complexity of the engagement 
hosting fees based on the amount of data stored 
deposit based fees  earned primarily based on a percentage of chapter total liquidated assets placed on deposit with a designated financial institution by our trustee clients  to whom we provide  at no charge  software licenses  limited hardware and hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support services 
the fees we earn based on total liquidated assets placed on deposit by our trustee clients may vary based on fluctuations in short term interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations are somewhat mitigated by pricing arrangements with each financial institution that set ceilings and floors on the interest rates that we earn 
legal noticing services to parties of interest in bankruptcy and class action matters  including direct notification  media campaign  and advertising management in which we coordinate notification through various media outlets  such as print  radio and television  to potential parties of interest for a particular client engagement 
reimbursement for costs incurred  primarily related to postage on mailing services 
non software arrangements services related to electronic discovery and settlement administration are billed based on volume and are evaluated pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
for these contractual arrangements  we have identified each deliverable service element 
based on our evaluation of each element  we have determined that each element delivered has standalone value to our customers because we or other vendors sell such services separately from any other services deliverables 
we have also obtained objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of each element based either on the price we charge when we sell an element on a standalone basis or based on third party evidence of fair value of such similar services 
lastly  our arrangements do not include general rights of return 
accordingly  each of the service elements in our multiple element case and document management arrangements qualifies as a separate unit of accounting under eitf we allocate revenue to the various units of accounting in our arrangements based on the fair value of each unit of accounting  which is generally consistent with the stated prices in our arrangements 
as we have evidence of an arrangement  revenue for each separate unit of accounting is recognized each period in accordance with staff accounting bulletin topic  
table of contents revenue recognition sab topic 
revenue is recognized as the services are rendered  our fee becomes fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received in advance of satisfaction of the related revenue recognition criteria are recognized as a customer deposit until all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
software arrangements for our chapter bankruptcy trustee arrangements  we provide our trustee clients with a software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support services  all at no charge to the trustee 
the trustees place their liquidated estate deposits with a financial institution with which we have an arrangement 
we earn contingent monthly fees from the financial institutions based on the dollar level of average monthly deposits held by the trustees with that financial institution  related to the software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support services 
we account for the software license and postcontract customer support elements in accordance with sop since we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the software license  we do not recognize any revenue on delivery of the software 
the software element is deferred and included with the remaining undelivered element  which is postcontract customer support services 
this revenue  when recognized  is included as a component of case management services revenue 
revenue related to postcontract customer support is entirely contingent on the placement of liquidated estate deposits by the trustee with the financial institution 
accordingly  we recognize this contingent usage based revenue consistent with the guidance provided by the american institute of certified public accountants technical practice aid tpa  fair value in multiple element arrangements that include contingent usage based fees and software revenue recognition  as the fee becomes fixed or determinable at the time actual usage occurs and collectibility is probable 
this occurs monthly as a result of the computation  billing and collection of monthly deposit fees contractually agreed to 
at that time  we have also satisfied the other revenue recognition criteria contained in sop since we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we also provide our trustee clients with certain hardware such as desktop computers  monitors and printers  and hardware maintenance 
we retain ownership of all hardware provided and  based on guidance provided in eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  we account for this hardware as a lease 
as the hardware maintenance arrangement is an executory contract similar to an operating lease  we use guidance related to contingent rentals in operating lease arrangements for hardware maintenance as well as for the hardware lease 
since the payments under all of our arrangements are contingent upon the level of trustee deposits and the delivery of upgrades and other services  and there remain important uncertainties regarding the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us  we account for the hardware lease as an operating lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
therefore  all lease payments  based on the estimated fair value of hardware provided  were accounted for as contingent rentals under eitf issue no 
 accounting for contingent rent and sab topic  which requires that we recognize rental income when the changes in the factor on which the contingent lease payment is based actually occur 
this occurs at the end of each period as we achieve our target when deposits are held at the depository financial institution as  at that time  evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the amount has become fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
this revenue  which is less than ten percent of our total revenue  is included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of case management services revenue 
reimbursements we have revenue related to the reimbursement of certain costs  primarily related to postage 
consistent with guidance provided by eitf no 
 income statement characterization of 
table of contents reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  reimbursed postage and other reimbursable direct costs are recorded gross in the consolidated statements of income as operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs and as reimbursed direct costs  respectively 
share based compensation we have accounted for share based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
as a result of our adoption of sfas r on january   we now recognize expense related to share options issued prior to but unvested as of january  as well as expense related to share options issued subsequent to january  for share options issued after january   the share options were also valued using the black scholes option valuation model 
key assumptions for the black scholes option valuation model include expected volatility  expected term of share options granted  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend rate 
we estimate our expected volatility based on implied volatilities from traded share options on our stock and on our stock s historical volatility 
we have estimated the expected term of our share options based on the historical exercise pattern of groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior 
the expected risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
historically  we have not paid dividends and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  accordingly  our expected dividend rate is zero 
we recognize this expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the last separately vesting portion of the award 
due to the numerous assumptions involved in calculating share based compensation expense  the expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from the value realized by employees on exercise of the share based instruments 
in accordance with the methodology prescribed by sfas r  we do not adjust our recognized compensation expense to reflect these differences 
recognition of share based compensation expense had  and will likely continue to have  a material effect on our direct cost of services and general and administrative line items within our consolidated statements of income and also may have a material effect on our deferred income taxes and additional paid in capital line items within our consolidated balance sheets 
the adoption of sfas r also affected the classification within our consolidated statement of cash flows of certain tax benefits as certain tax benefits formerly classified as an operating cash flow are now classified as a financing cash flow 
as of december   the only share based compensation we have issued is share options 
for additional information see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
business combination accounting we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including quoted market prices and estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed over the intangible asset s estimated economic benefit period  generally from five to ten years 
goodwill is not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 

table of contents in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes guidelines for the recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities and equity in business combinations 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  management is still evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas r will have on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
due to the adoption of this standard on january   we have elected to expense  as incurred  all acquisition related costs in for business combinations for which the potential acquisition date was expected to be in fiscal for the year ended december   we had approximately million of acquisition related expense resulting from non capitalizable expenses under sfas  as well as expenses related to potential acquisitions that did not result in a completed transaction or were still under consideration as of december  this expense is included in other operating income expense  net in our consolidated statements of income 
goodwill we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment each year as of july and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit using both a market approach and an income approach 
if potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a change in events or circumstances  including a decision to hold an asset or group of assets for sale  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
the estimate of fair value is highly subjective and requires significant judgment related to the estimate of the magnitude and timing of future reporting unit cash flows 
if we determine that the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s carrying value  then we proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis to measure the potential impairment charge 
if goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our recognized goodwill totaled million as of december  identifiable intangible assets each period we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each identifiable intangible asset 
if we were to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an identifiable intangible asset s remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the identifiable intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
additionally  information developed during our annual assessment  or other events and circumstances  may indicate that the carrying value of one or more identifiable intangible assets is not recoverable and its fair value is less than the identifiable intangible asset s carrying value and would result in recognition of an impairment charge 
a change in the estimate of the remaining life of one or more identifiable intangible assets or the impairment of one or more identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our identifiable intangible assets carrying value  net of amortization  was million as of december  
table of contents income taxes a deferred tax asset or liability recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and  if necessary  execution of our tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that sufficient future taxable income  taking into consideration tax planning strategies  may not generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize net deferred tax assets  we may be required to establish or increase valuation allowances by a charge to income tax expense in the period such a determination is made 
this charge may have a material impact on recognized income tax expense on our consolidated statements of income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the recognition of a change in enacted tax rates may have a material impact on recognized income tax expense and on our consolidated statements of income 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
application of fin requires numerous estimates based on available information 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  and our recognized tax positions and tax benefits may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
as we obtain additional information  we may need to periodically adjust our recognized tax positions and tax benefits 
these periodic adjustments may have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin was reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of january  the cumulative effect adjustment does not include items that would not be recognized in earnings  such as the effect on tax positions related to business combinations 
for additional information related to our adoption of fin  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
in august of  in order to limit our economic exposure to market fluctuations in interest rates  we purchased one month libor based interest rate floor options with a total notional amount of million and initial contractual maturity of three years 
we accounted for this transaction pursuant to the guidance contained in sfas sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
as the interest rate floor options were not designated as an accounting hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivatives were recorded each period in current earnings 
for the year ended december   the change in the fair value of the interest rate floor options was recognized as an unrealized gain of million and was included as a component of other operating income on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
during february  we sold the interest rate floor options and realized a million gain 
the million difference between 
table of contents the realized gain of million and the previously recognized gain of million is included as a component of other operating income on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
as of december   we did not hold any interest rate floor options  other derivatives  or auction rate securities 
recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact to our future consolidated results of operations or financial condition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed include interest rates under our senior revolving credit facility  foreign exchange rates giving rise to translation  and fluctuations in short term interest rates on a portion of our bankruptcy trustee revenue 
interest rate risk interest on our senior revolving credit facility is generally based on a spread  not to exceed basis points over the libor rate 
there were no amounts due under our senior revolving credit facility as of december   thereby we had no market risk exposure 
as of december  we had market risk exposure to interest rates as we held interest rate floor options with a notional value of million 
during february  we sold the interest rate floor options and realized a million gain  thereby eliminating our market risk exposure related to these instruments 
at december   we did not hold any interest rate floor options or other derivatives 
foreign currency risk we have limited operations in london  therefore  a portion of our revenues and expenses are incurred in a currency other than us dollars 
we do not utilize hedge instruments to manage the exposures associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs
