overview national instruments corporation we or our is a leading supplier of measurement and automation products that engineers and scientists use in a wide range of industries 
these industries comprise a large and diverse market for design  control and test applications 
we provide flexible application software and modular  multifunctional hardware that users combine with industry standard computers  networks and third party devices to create measurement  automation and embedded systems  which we also refer to as virtual instruments 
our approach gives customers the ability to quickly and cost effectively design  prototype and deploy unique custom defined solutions for their design  control and test application needs 
we sell to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries 
no single customer accounted for more than of our sales in  or the key strategies that management focuses on in running our business are the following expanding our broad customer base we strive to increase our already broad customer base by serving a large market on many computer platforms  through a global marketing and distribution network 
we also seek to acquire new technologies and expertise from time to time in order to open new opportunities for our existing product portfolio 
while we continue our efforts to expand our customer base  we are also benefiting from our efforts in increasing order size from both new and existing customers 
maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction we strive to offer innovative  modular and integrated products through a global sales and support network 
we strive to maintain a high degree of backwards compatibility across different platforms in order to preserve the customer s investment in our products 
in this time of intense global competition  we believe it is crucial that we continue to offer products with quality and reliability  and that these products provide cost effective solutions for our customers 
leveraging external and internal technology our product strategy is to provide superior products by leveraging generally available technology  supporting open architectures on multiple platforms and by leveraging our core technologies such as custom application specific integrated circuits asics across multiple products 
we sell into test and measurement t m and industrial embedded applications in a broad range of industries and as such are subject to the economic and industry forces which drive those markets 
it has been our experience that the performance of these industries and our performance is impacted by general trends in industrial production for the global economy and by the specific performance of certain vertical markets that are intensive consumers of measurement technologies 
examples of these markets are semiconductor capital equipment  telecom  defense  aerospace  automotive and others 
in assessing our business  we consider the trends in the global purchasing managers index pmi published by jp morgan  global industrial production as well as industry reports on the specific vertical industries that we target 
the global industrial economy is currently in a recession 
many economists and other experts are predicting that this recession in the us and global economies will likely continue through the remainder of and possibly beyond 
we are unable to predict how long this recession will last 
we expect our business to continue to be adversely impacted by this downturn in the us or global economies 
we distribute our software and hardware products primarily through a direct sales organization 
we also use independent distributors  oems  vars  system integrators and consultants to market our products 
we have sales offices in the united states and sales offices and distributors in key international markets 
sales outside of the americas accounted for approximately   and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
the vast majority of our foreign sales are denominated in the customers local currency  which exposes us to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be derived from international sales 
see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details concerning the geographic breakdown of our net sales  operating income  interest income and identifiable assets 
we manufacture a substantial majority of our products at our facilities in debrecen  hungary 
additional production primarily of low volume or newly introduced products is done in austin  texas 
our product manufacturing operations can be divided into four areas electronic circuit card and module assembly  chassis and cable assembly  technical manuals and product support documentation  and software duplication 
we manufacture most of the electronic circuit card assemblies  and modules in house  although subcontractors are used from time to time 
we use subcontractors in asia to manufacture a significant portion of our chassis 
we manufacture some of our electronic cable assemblies in house  but many assemblies are produced by subcontractors 
we primarily subcontract our software duplication  our technical manuals and product support documentation 
we believe that our long term growth and success depends on delivering high quality software and hardware products on a timely basis 
accordingly  we focus significant efforts on research and development 
we focus our research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and developing new products that incorporate appropriate features and functionality to be competitive with respect to technology and price performance 
our success also is dependent on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights related to technologies used in our products 
we have engaged in litigation and will likely engage in future litigation to protect our intellectual property rights 
in monitoring and policing our intellectual property rights  we have been and may be required to spend significant resources 
we have been profitable in every year since however  there can be no assurance that our net sales will grow or that we will remain profitable in future periods 
our operating results fluctuate from period to period due to changes in global economic conditions and a number of other factors 
as a result  we believe historical results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items reflected in our

consolidated statements of income 
we have added this disclosure due to the increasing percentage of our revenue coming from software maintenance 
as part of this expanded disclosure  some technical support costs previously reported as a component of sales and marketing expense are now reported as cost of software maintenance 
this change has had no impact on our operating income  net income or earnings per share 
all amounts shown above have been reclassified to conform to this new presentation  the effect of these changes for the years and are as follows cost of sales as previously reported technical support costs previously reported as sales and marketing cost of sales adjusted for reclassification sales and marketing as previously reported technical support costs previously reported as sales and marketing sales and marketing adjusted for reclassification net sales 
consolidated net sales were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  an increase of in over following an increase in of from the level achieved in the increase in can primarily be attributed to volume growth in the areas of modular instruments  particularly rf test products  pxi  software and compactrio which performed very well in light of the industry contraction 
the increases in these areas were offset by declines in revenue from instrument control products which are the most sensitive to downturns in the global pmi 
for  the increase in revenue compared to  can primarily be attributed to increased market acceptance of our virtual instrumentation and graphical system design products  which constitute the vast majority of our product portfolios as well as the introduction of new and upgraded products in all regions

we intend to continue to expand our international operations by increasing our presence in existing markets  adding a presence in some new geographical markets and continuing the use of distributors to sell our products in some countries 
almost all sales made by our direct sales offices in the americas  outside of the united states  in europe and in asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates

the increase in sales and marketing expense for  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales  was consistent with our plan to make additional investments in our field sales force during approximately of the increase can be attributed to the increase in sales and marketing personnel  increases in stock based compensation and the increase in variable compensation from higher sales volume

we plan to continue to make additional investments in our field sales force in however  due to the dramatic downturn in the industrial economy during the last half of and due to the fact that we cannot anticipate when this downturn might ease  our field sales expansion during will likely be less than it was in we expect sales and marketing expenses in future periods to increase in absolute dollars  and to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on recruiting  marketing and advertising campaign costs associated with major new product releases and entry into new market areas  investment in web sales and marketing efforts  increasing product demonstration costs and the timing of domestic and international conferences and trade shows

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  an increase of in over following an increase in of from the level achieved in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were for each of  and during  the increase in absolute dollars compared to can primarily be attributed to the net impact of foreign currency exchange rates which had the effect of increasing our general and administrative expense by million or 
in  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs due to the increase in general and administrative personnel and increases in stock based compensation as well as severance and lease termination costs incurred as a result of the restructuring of our dublin  ireland operations 
we expect that general and administrative expenses in future periods will fluctuate in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  a decrease of in over following an increase in of from the level achieved in the decrease in compared to is attributable to a decrease in invested funds as well as to the rapid rate of decrease in interest rates during the second half of the increase in interest income in compared to was primarily driven by an increase in invested funds 
the primary source of interest income is from the investment of our cash and short term and long term investments 
net foreign exchange gain loss 
net foreign exchange gain loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these results are attributable to movements in the foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in countries where our functional currency is not the us dollar 
we recognize the local currency as the functional currency in virtually all of our international subsidiaries 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated net receivable positions to protect against the reduction in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates 
we typically hedge up to of our outstanding foreign denominated net receivables and typically limit the duration of these foreign currency forward contracts to approximately days 
the gain or loss on these derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedge item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings under the line item net foreign exchange gain loss 
to protect against the change in the value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales and expenses over the next one to two years  we have instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
we hedge portions of our forecasted revenue and forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward and option contracts 
for forward contracts  when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies  the change in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows may be offset by the change in the fair value of the forward contracts designated as hedges 
for option contracts  when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies  the change in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows may be offset by the change in the fair value of the option contracts net of the premium paid designated as hedges 
our foreign currency purchased option contracts are purchased at the money or out of the money 
we purchase foreign currency forward and option contracts for up to of our forecasted exposures in selected currencies primarily in euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and hungarian forint and limit the duration of these contracts to months or less 
as a result  our hedging activities only partially address our risks from foreign currency transactions  and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
we do not invest in contracts for speculative purposes 
see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our forward and purchased option contracts and hedged positions 
our hedging strategy reduced our foreign exchange losses by million in and reduced our foreign exchange gains by million in provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for  our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of the research credit  reduced tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions  the partial release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and a decrease in uncertain tax positions 
for  our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of the research credit  reduced tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions  tax exempt interest and the partial release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
for  our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of the research credit  reduced tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and tax exempt interest 
the increase in our effective tax rate in compared to is primarily due to the fact that the partial release of the valuation allowance in was million compared to million in the partial release of the valuation allowance has the effect of decreasing our effective tax rate in the period in which it is released 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in compared to was due to increased profits in foreign jurisdictions with reduced income tax rates and the partial release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets recorded as a result of the restructuring of our manufacturing operation in hungary 
in october  the us president signed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of  which extended the research credit for two years with effect from january  the effects of this new legislation is included in our income for the period that includes the enactment date in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources working capital  cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
the following table presents our working capital  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands december  december  increase decrease working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total cash  cash equivalents  short and long term investments included in working capital our working capital and short term investments decreased by million and million  respectively  in compared to primarily due to repurchases of shares of our common stock  dividend payments  capital expenditures and net cash paid for acquisitions  offset in part by cash provided by operations 
our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in numerous financial institutions throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside of the us  however  the majority of our cash and investments that are located outside of the us are denominated in the us dollar 
most of the amounts held outside of the us could be repatriated to the us  but under current law  would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
in some countries repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes  except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us repatriation could result in additional us federal income tax payments in future years 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations in which it is needed 
cash provided and used in and cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  as a result of the net effect of cash provided by operating activities  cash provided by investing activities and cash used in financing activities 
the following table summarizes the proceeds and uses of cash in thousands december  cash provided by operating activities cash provided by investing activities cash used in investing activities net increase in cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year our operating activities provided million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease in compared to in  cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of million in net income and million in net non cash operating expenses which primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and benefits from deferred income taxes  offset in part by million in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities  principally a million increase in inventory 
in  cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of million in net income and million in net non cash operating expenses which primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and benefits from deferred income taxes  as well as million in net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities  principally a decrease in taxes and other liabilities of million 
accounts receivable decreased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of lower sales levels in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of as well as a decrease in days sales outstanding to days at december  compared to days at december  we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net thirty day payment terms 
if  in the longer term  our revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could also increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers  both of which are more likely to occur during challenging economic times when our customers may face issues gaining access to sufficient funding or credit 
consolidated inventory balances increased to million at december  from million at december  inventory turns decreased to per year for compared to per year for the increase in inventory in was driven primarily by increased production in anticipation of high demand levels during the fourth quarter of which did not materialize as a result of the sharp drop in the global industrial economy during the last quarter of our inventory levels will continue to be determined based upon our anticipated demand for products and our need to keep sufficient inventory on hand to meet our customers demands 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
in the near future  we will likely work towards reducing our inventory from the balance at december   due to the continued slowdown in the industrial economy 
rapid changes in industrial demand could have a significant impact on our inventory balances in the future 
investing activities provided cash of million in  which was primarily the result of the net sale of million of short term investments  offset by the purchase of property and equipment of million  a net cash payment of million related to the acquisition of microlex systems aps see

investing activities provided cash of million in  which was primarily the result of the net sale of million of short term investments  offset by the purchase of property and equipment of million  capitalization of internally developed software of million and the acquisition of other intangibles of million 
financing activities used million in  which was primarily the result of million used to repurchase our common stock and million used to pay dividends to our shareholders  offset by million received as a result of the issuance of our common stock from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities used million in  which was primarily the result of million used to repurchase our common stock and million used to pay dividends to our shareholders  offset by million received as a result of the issuance of our common stock from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
from time to time our board of directors has authorized various programs to repurchase shares of our common stock depending on market conditions and other factors 
under such programs  we repurchased a total of   and  shares of our common stock at weighted average prices of  and per share  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
on april   our board of directors authorized our current program to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
at december   there were  shares remaining for repurchases under this program 
on january   our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program which increased the aggregate number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to repurchase up to million shares 
our repurchase plan does not have an expiration date 
the average price of our common stock decreased during the second half of compared to the previous year  and as a result  fewer stock options were exercised by employees  and we received reduced proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the timing and number of stock option exercises and the amount of cash proceeds we receive through those exercises are not within our control  and in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past 
moreover  it is now our practice to issue restricted stock units and not stock options to eligible employees which will reduce the number of stock options available for exercise in the future 
unlike the exercise of stock options  the issuance of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units does not result in any cash proceeds to us 
contractual cash obligations 
the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations the following summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands total beyond guarantees purchase obligations total commercial commitments we have commitments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for office facilities throughout the world 
certain leases require us to pay property taxes  insurance and routine maintenance  and include escalation clauses 
as of december   we have non cancelable operating lease obligations of approximately million compared to million at december  rent expense under operating leases was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
purchase obligations primarily represent purchase commitments for customized inventory and inventory components 
as of december   we have non cancelable purchase commitments with various suppliers of customized inventory and inventory components totaling approximately million over the next twelve months 
at december   we had non cancelable purchase commitments with various suppliers of customized inventory and inventory components totaling approximately million 
guarantees are related to payments of customs and foreign grants 
as of december   we have outstanding guarantees for payment of customs and foreign grants totaling approximately million 
as of december   we had outstanding guarantees for payment of customs and foreign grants totaling approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any debt or off balance sheet debt 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships 
prospective capital needs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated from operations and from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  commitments  payment of dividends to our shareholders and repurchases of our common stock for at least the next months 
however  we may choose or be required to raise additional funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
historically  we have not had to rely on debt  public or private  to fund our operating  financing or investing activities 
we could also choose or be required to reduce certain expenditures  such as payments of dividends or repurchases of our common stock 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the industrial economy  current general economic volatility and trends in the industrial economy in various geographic regions in which we do business  the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly in the current global economic environment  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans  and product and technology roadmaps  the market acceptance of our products  repurchases of our common stock  required levels of research and development and other operating costs  litigation expenses  settlements and judgments  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies  royalties payable by or to us  changes in our compensation policies  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors responses to our products and our anticipation of and responses to their products  our relationships with suppliers and customers  and  the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned future long term growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies under other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  sfas is amended by fsp fas  application of fasb statement to fasb statement and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement  which excludes from the scope of this provision arrangements accounted for under sfas  accounting for leases 
sfas is also amended by fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement  which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
in october  sfas was amended again by fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the fsp is effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
we adopted sfas on january   except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas the partial adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we also adopted fsp on september  as required and concluded it did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement this standard permits an entity to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted sfas on january  as required 
the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations as we did not elect the fair value option for items within the scope of this statement 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations a replacement of fasb statement  which significantly changes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement is effective prospectively  except for certain retrospective adjustments to deferred tax balances  for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
this statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  early application is encouraged 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r  business combinations  and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
the provisions of fsp fas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of fsp fas and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be materially different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale licensing of integrated hardware and software solutions 
independent sales of application software licenses include post contract support services 
in addition  training services are sold separately 
the products and services are generally sold under standardized licensing and sales arrangements with payment terms ranging from net days in the united states to net days and up to net days in some international markets 
approximately of our product license sales include both hardware and software in the customer arrangement  with a small percentage of sales including other services 
we offer rights of return and standard warranties for product defects related to our products 
the rights of return are generally for a period of up to days after the delivery date 
the standard warranties cover periods ranging from days to three years 
we do not enter into contracts requiring product acceptance from the customer 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the provisions of sop when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
we enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or services multiple elements 
in these transactions  we allocate the total revenue among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value as determined by the sales price of each element when sold separately 
when vsoe of fair value is available for the undelivered element of a multiple element arrangements  sales revenue is generally recognized on the date the product is shipped  using the residual method under sop  with a portion of revenue recorded as deferred unearned due to applicable undelivered elements 
undelivered elements for our multiple element arrangements with a customer are generally restricted to post contract support and training and education 
the amount of revenue allocated to these undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those undelivered elements 
deferred revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the service period or when the service is completed 
when vsoe of fair value is not available for the undelivered element of a multiple element arrangement  sales revenue is generally recognized ratably  on a straight line basis over the service period of the undelivered element  generally months or when the service is completed in accordance with the subscription method under sop deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of our earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
estimating allowances for sales returns the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our sales returns allowance 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns allowance in any accounting period 
a provision for estimated sales returns is made by reducing recorded revenue by the amount of the allowance 
accounts receivable is reported net of the allowance for sales returns 
the allowance for sales returns was million and million at december  and  respectively 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates or if actual results varied materially from our estimates 
estimating allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and the adjustment for excess and obsolete inventories the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
in addition to estimating an allowance for sales returns  we must also make estimates about the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we also write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was million and million at december  and  respectively 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these allowances 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our bad debt and inventory obsolescence if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates or if actual results varied materially from our estimates 
accounting for costs of computer software we capitalize costs related to the development and acquisition of certain software products 
capitalization of costs begins when technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility for our products is established when the product is available for beta release 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
amortization is computed on an individual product basis for those products available for market and has been recognized based on the product s estimated economic life  generally three years 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized costs are reviewed by management and reduced to net realized value when necessary 
as of december   unamortized capitalized software development costs was million 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as we have one reporting segment  we allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and  our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the measurement of any impairment is determined and the carrying value is reduced as appropriate 
as of december   we had net goodwill of approximately million 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events are considered other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized 
as a result of certain foreign investment incentives available under hungarian law  the profit from our hungarian operation was subject to a reduced income tax rate 
this special tax status terminated on january   with the merger of our hungary manufacturing operations with its hungarian parent company 
the tax position of our hungarian operation continues to benefit from assets created by the restructuring of our operations in hungary 
we expect profit from our hungarian operation in future periods to result in realization of a portion of these assets 
partial release of the valuation allowance on these assets resulted in income tax benefits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these benefits may not be available in the future due to changes in hungary s political condition and or tax laws 
the reduction or elimination of these tax benefits in hungary or future changes in us law pertaining to taxation of foreign earnings could result in an increase in our future effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
loss contingencies we accrue for probable losses from contingencies including legal defense costs  on an undiscounted basis  in accordance with sfas  accounting for loss contingencies  when such costs are considered probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable 
we periodically evaluate available information  both internal and external  relative to such contingencies and adjust this accrual as necessary 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management our international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the vast majority of our sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  we are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
during  the us dollar generally traded lower against other major currencies that impact our business 
this had the effect of increasing our consolidated sales by compared to since most of our international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  the change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing our operating expenses by million over the same period 
currently  we are experiencing significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in many of the markets in which we do business 
this has had a significant impact on the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated firm commitments and on our ability to forecast us dollar equivalent revenues and expenses 
if the local currencies in which we sell our products strengthen against the us dollar  we may need to lower our prices in the local currency to remain competitive in our international markets which could have a material adverse effect on our gross and net profit margins 
if the local currencies in which we sell our products weaken against the us dollar and if the local sales prices cannot be raised due to competitive pressures  we will experience a deterioration of our gross and net profit margins 
our foreign currency hedging program includes both foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  our hedging program will not eliminate all of our foreign exchange risks  particularly when market conditions experience the recent level of volatility 
see net foreign exchange gain loss and 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory management the marketplace for our products dictates that many of our products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
as a result  we are required to maintain significant inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for us due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by us or our competitors of products embodying new technology 
while we adjust for excess and obsolete inventories and we monitor the valuation of our inventories  there can be no assurance that our valuation adjustments will be sufficient 
market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of our investments 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions located in many countries throughout the world 
approximately million or of these amounts were held in domestic accounts with financial institutions and million or was held in accounts outside of the united states with financial institutions 
cash and cash equivalents consisted of million or of our cash and cash equivalents were held in cash in various operating accounts throughout the world  million or was held in time deposits which had original maturities of less than days  million or was held in money market accounts 
the most significant of our operating accounts was our domestic operating account which held approximately million or of our total cash and cash equivalents at a bank that carried an aaa rating at december  our short term investment balance of million was held in our investment account in the united states 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various types of security holdings and maturities 
pursuant to sfas  fair value measurements  cash equivalents and short term investments available for sale are valued using a market approach level based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments when available or other observable inputs such as trading prices of identical instruments in inactive markets 
the goal of our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards  as specified in our corporate investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
other than our auction rate securities discussed below  at december   our cash equivalents and short term investments carried ratings from the major credit rating agencies that were in accordance with our corporate investment policy 
our investment policy allows investments in the following  government and federal agency obligations  repurchase agreements repos  certificates of deposit and time deposits  corporate obligations  medium term notes and deposit notes  commercial paper including asset backed commercial paper abcp  puttable bonds  general obligation and revenue bonds  money market funds  taxable commercial paper  corporate notes bonds  municipal notes  municipal obligations  variable rate demand notes and tax exempt commercial paper 
all such instruments must carry minimum ratings of a p f  mig vmig sp and a a a  as applicable  all of which are considered investment grade 
our investment policy for marketable securities requires that all securities mature in three years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than months with at least maturing in days or less 
we account for our investments in debt and equity instruments under sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp  sfas no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
our investments are classified as available for sale and accordingly are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
unrealized losses are charged against income when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
investments with maturities beyond one year are classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
the fair value of our short term investments in marketable securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to the net sale of million of our short term investments during primarily to fund the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
we follow the guidance provided by fsp fas to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income expense  net  in our 
consolidated statements of income 
long term investments our long term investments consist primarily of aaa a aaa rated investments in auction rate securities that we originally purchased for million 
these auction rate securities consist of education loan revenue bonds 
auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are typically reset approximately every to days 
on december   and in prior auction periods beginning in february  the auction process for these securities failed 
prior to the failure of the auction process  we had classified these investments as short term but are now reporting them as long term due to the fact that the underlying securities generally have longer dated contractual maturities which are in excess of the guidelines provided for in our corporate investment policy 
the auction rate securities are classified as available for sale 
at december   we reported these long term investments at their estimated fair market value of million 
in november  we accepted the ubs auction rate securities rights the rights agreement offered by ubs as a liquidity alternative to the failed auction process 
this rights agreement is related to the auction rates securities discussed above 
the rights agreement is a nontransferable right to sell our auction rate securities  at par value  back to ubs at any time during the period june   through july  at december   we reported the rights agreement at its estimated fair market value of million 
we continue to have the ability to hold the debt instruments to their ultimate maturity and have not made a determination as to whether we will exercise our right under the rights agreement described above 
as such  we have recorded the unrealized loss related to the auction rate securities and the unrealized gain related to the rights agreement as a component of other income expense  in our 
consolidated statements of income 
the estimated fair market value of the rights agreement is also included as a component of our long term investments 
the estimated fair market value of both the auction rate securities and the rights agreement was determined using significant unobservable inputs level as prescribed by sfas  fair value measurements 
the debt instruments underlying the auction rate securities have redemption features which call for redemption at of par value and had a minimum rating of aaa a aaa at december  both of these factors  along with current credit curves for like securities  and discount factors to account for the illiquidity of the market for these securities were considered in determining the fair market value of the auction rate securities as well as our corresponding rights agreement at december  see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
we do not consider these investments as liquid in the short term and therefore continued to classify them as long term investments at december  the auction rate market is not expected to provide liquidity for these securities in the foreseeable future 
should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities prior to their maturity or prior to our exercise period under the rights agreement discussed above  we may be unable to find a buyer in a secondary market outside the auction process or if a buyer in a secondary market is found  we would likely realize a loss 
interest rate risk investments in both fixed rate and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in the income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  the current interest rate environment of low or declining rates may negatively impact our investment income 
in order to assess the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on our investment positions as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a  increase or decrease in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of december   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a  increase or decrease in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity or if there is a other than temporary impairment 
actual future gains and losses associated with our investments may differ from the sensitivity analyses performed as of december  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and level of interest rates and our actual exposures and positions 
current economic conditions have had widespread negative effects on the financial markets 
due to credit concerns and lack of liquidity in the short term funding markets  we shifted a larger percentage of our portfolio to money market funds  us treasuries and time deposits during this has negatively impacted and will likely to continue to negatively impact our investment income  particularly if yields continue to decline or stay at low levels 
exchange rate risk our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in such exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow 
accordingly  we utilize purchased foreign currency option and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitments 
the principal currencies hedged are the euro  british pound  japanese yen  korean won and hungarian forint 
we monitor our foreign exchange exposures regularly to help ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
throughout  we experienced significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in many of the markets in which we do business 
therefore  there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchanges rates on our results of operations and financial position 
based on the foreign exchange instruments outstanding at december  and  an adverse change defined as in the asian currencies and in all other currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in the aggregate settlement value of all of our instruments outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
however  as we utilize foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  we believe that a loss in settlement value for those instruments will be substantially offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure
