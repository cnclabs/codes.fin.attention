other costs  excluding feed grains  related to the profitability of the company s poultry operations  including hatching egg production  hatching  growing  and processing cost  are responsive to efficient cost containment programs and management practices 
over the past three fiscal years  these other normal production costs have averaged approximately of the company s total normal production costs 
the company believes that value added products are subject to less price volatility and generate higher  more consistent profit margin than whole chickens ice packed and shipped in bulk form 
to reduce its exposure to market cyclicality that has historically characterized commodity chicken market prices  the company has increasingly concentrated on the production and marketing of value added product lines with emphasis on product quality  customer service  and brand recognition 
the company adds value to its poultry products by performing one or more processing steps beyond the stage where the whole chicken is first saleable as a finished product  such as cutting  deep chilling  packaging and labeling the product 
the company believes that one of its major strengths is its ability to change its product mix to meet customer demands

if the company had priced all of its remaining needs for corn and soybean meal for fiscal at december  market prices  feed grain costs would be approximately million higher during fiscal as compared to fiscal the improvement in the overall market prices for poultry products during fiscal resulted more from a tightening of the supply of poultry products than an improvement in demand from consumers 
while demand for fresh chicken in retail grocery stores was relatively strong during fiscal  demand from some food service customers has been weak 
the company expects demand for chicken products to continue to be a challenge for the industry into fiscal and until overall economic conditions in the united states and traffic in restaurants improve

advertising expenditures during fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively 
on october   the company recorded a charge of million to lower the value of live broiler inventories on hand from cost to estimated market value because the estimated market price for products to be produced from those live chickens when sold was below the estimated cost to grow  process and distribute those chickens 
as of october  market fundamentals had improved such that the estimated market prices of the products to be produced from the company s live broiler inventories were higher than the estimated cost to grow  process and distribute those chickens and  accordingly  the company recorded its live broiler inventories on october  at cost 
the million adjustment to live broiler inventories on october  effectively absorbed into fiscal a portion of the costs to grow  process and distribute chicken that were incurred and would have otherwise been recognized in fiscal during september and october of market prices for products sold to some export markets declined significantly due to the world economic environment and the resulting tightening of the credit markets 
the company s processed inventory at october  included approximately million pounds of leg quarters and paws awaiting shipment into the export markets

the feed mill returned to normal operations subsequent to electricity service being restored 
the company s insurance policy had a deductible of  for the hurricane season

the company s cost of feed grains was approximately million higher during fiscal compared to fiscal these higher feed costs added approximately cents per pound to the cost of a pound of chicken 
the company s results for fiscal as compared to fiscal reflect the fact that prices for the company s poultry products did not move in tandem with the higher grain costs  which made up approximately of the company s cost of goods sold during fiscal while feed costs increased more than cents per pound  the company s sales price of poultry products only increased cents per pound 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company and industry experienced decreasing prices for boneless breast meat resulting from weak demand from food service and significantly lower prices for chicken leg quarters for the export market as a result of the world financial crises and the resulting tightening credit markets

the increase in net sales resulted from an increase in the company s average sales price of poultry products sold of and an increase in the pounds of poultry products sold of 
the additional pounds of poultry products sold resulted from an increase in the number of chickens produced of and an increase in the average live weight of chickens produced of  partially offset by an increase in inventory of processed chicken 
the additional number of chickens processed was primarily the result of the additional production at the company s new waco processing division  which began operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal and has increased production since that time 
the new waco plant is dedicated to the big bird deboning market and chickens processed at that plant have a higher average live weight than chickens processed at the company s chill pack processing locations  resulting in a higher average live weight of chickens produced in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal as compared to fiscal  the average sales price of the company s poultry products increased due to improvements during the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the first quarter of fiscal however  the improvement during the first quarter in market prices for poultry products was partially offset by lower overall market prices during the subsequent three quarters of fiscal as compared to the same periods during fiscal for fiscal as compared to fiscal  market prices for boneless breast  jumbo wings and tenders as reported by urner barry ub were  and lower  respectively

the company recorded a charge of million to lower the value of live broiler inventories on hand at october   which resulted primarily from the significant decrease in expected market prices for export leg quarters and chicken paws and relatively low domestic prices for boneless breast meat during november and december of in favorable market conditions the company values the broiler inventories on hand at cost  and accumulates costs as the birds are grown to a marketable age subsequent to the balance sheet date 
however  the company estimated that the cost to grow the live birds on the ground at october  to a marketable age and process and distribute these birds during november and december was higher than the anticipated sales price during those months  resulting in a loss of million  before income taxes

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions  and the differences could be material 
allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes provisions for probable doubtful accounts based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  and the allowance for doubtful accounts and related bad debt expense would increase by the same amount 
inventories processed and prepared inventories and inventories of feed  eggs  medication and packaging supplies are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
when market prices for poultry are low and feed grains are high  the company may be required to write down the carrying values of processed poultry and feed inventories to fair market value  which would increase the company s cost of sales 
live poultry inventories of broilers are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeders at cost less accumulated amortization 
the cost associated with broiler inventories  consisting principally of chicks  feed  medicine and payments to the growers who raise the chicks for us  are accumulated during the growing period 
the cost associated with breeder inventories  consisting principally of breeder chicks  feed  medicine and grower payments are accumulated during the growing period 
capitalized breeder costs are then amortized over nine months using the straight line method 
mortality of broilers and breeders is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
if market prices for chicks  feed or medicine or if grower payments increase or decrease during the period  the company could have an increase or decrease in the market value of its inventory as well as an increase or decrease in cost of sales 
should the company decide that the nine month amortization period used to amortize the breeder costs is no longer appropriate as a result of operational changes  a shorter or longer amortization period could increase or decrease the cost of sales recorded in future periods 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal charges to cost of sales to write down live poultry inventories 
inventories at october   included approximately million pounds of leg quarters and paws awaiting shipment into the export markets 
the market prices for dark meat and paws declined below their costs during september and october  resulting in an approximately l million adjustment  before income taxes  to processed inventory values 
in addition  the company made an adjustment to the value of its live inventories at october  as with processed inventories  the value of live chickens  the costs for which are accumulated during the life of a flock as each flock is fed and cared for  must be at the lower of cost or market 
because market prices declined during november and december  the projected cost to complete  process and sell broilers included in live inventory at october  was expected to exceed the market value for the finished product 
accordingly  the company s results for the year ended october  include a charge of million before income taxes to reduce the value of live inventories from cost to market 
the company s live broiler inventories are recorded at cost at october  because the estimated market value is higher than the estimated cost to complete those live broiler inventories 
long lived assets 
table of contents depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
the company continually reevaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of this reevaluation  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
if the company s assumptions with respect to the future expected cash flows associated with the use of long lived assets currently recorded change  then the company s determination that no impairment charges are necessary may change and result in the company recording an impairment charge in a future period 
accrued self insurance insurance expense for workers compensation benefits and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
management regularly reviews the assumptions used to recognize periodic expenses 
if historical experience proves not to be a good indicator of future expenses  if management were to use different actuarial assumptions  or if there is a negative trend in the company s claims history  there could be a significant increase or decrease in cost of sales depending on whether these expenses increased or decreased  respectively 
income taxes the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial and income tax purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities and considers any adjustments made as a result of the audits in computing the company s income tax expense 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
contingencies the company is involved in various claims and litigation incidental to its business 
although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty  management  upon the advice of counsel  is of the opinion that the final outcome should not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operation or financial position 
the company is a party to a number of legal proceedings and recognizes the costs of legal defense in the periods incurred 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these matters is made after considerable analysis of each individual case 
because the outcome of these cases cannot be determined with any certainty  no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss resulting from the cases can be made 
at this time  the company has not accrued any reserve for any of these matters 
future reserves may be required if losses are deemed probable due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of legal strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
future results of operations may be materially affected by the creation of or changes to reserves or by accruals of losses to reflect any adverse determinations of these legal proceedings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal  for use in manufacturing feed for its chickens 
as a result  the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
feed grains are subject to volatile price changes caused by factors described below that include weather  size of harvest  transportation and storage costs and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
the price fluctuations of feed grains have a direct and material effect on the company s profitability 
generally  the company purchases feed ingredients for deferred delivery from one month to six months after the time of purchase 
the company sometimes purchases its feed ingredients for prompt delivery to its feed mills at market prices at the time of such purchases 
the grain purchases are made directly with our usual grain suppliers  which are companies in the regular business of supplying grain to end users  and do not involve options to purchase 
such purchases occur when senior management concludes that market factors indicate that prices at the time the grain is needed are likely to be higher than current prices  or where  based on current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products  management believes it can purchase feed ingredients at prices that will allow the company to earn a reasonable return for its shareholders 
market factors considered by management in determining whether or not and to what extent to buy grain for deferred delivery include current market prices  current and predicted weather patterns in the united states  south america  china and other grain producing areas  as such weather patterns might affect the planting  growing  harvesting and yield of feed grains  
table of contents the expected size of the harvest of feed grains in the united states and other grain producing areas of the world as reported by governmental and private sources  current and expected changes to the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments  the relative strength of united states currency and expected changes therein as it might impact the ability of foreign countries to buy united states feed grain commodities  the current and expected volumes of export of feed grain commodities as reported by governmental and private sources  the current and expected use of available feed grains for uses other than as livestock feed grains such as the use of corn for the production of ethanol  which use is impacted by the price of crude oil  and current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products 
the company purchases physical grain  not financial instruments such as puts  calls or straddles that derive their value from the value of physical grain 
thus  the company does not use derivative financial instruments as defined by sfas  codified in asc  accounting for derivatives for instruments and hedging activities 
the company does not enter into any derivative transactions or purchase any grain related contracts other than the physical grain contracts described above 
the cost of feed grains is recognized in cost of sales  on a first in first out basis  at the same time that the sales of the chickens that consume the feed grains are recognized
