table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  under item of this form k 
overview ace limited is the holding company of the ace group of companies 
ace opened its business office in bermuda in and continues to maintain significant operations in bermuda 
ace limited  which is now headquartered in zurich  switzerland  and its direct and indirect subsidiaries collectively  the ace group of companies  ace  the company  we  us  or our are a global insurance and reinsurance organization  with operating subsidiaries in more than countries serving the needs of commercial and individual customers in more than countries 
we serve the property and casualty p c insurance needs of businesses of all sizes in a broad range of industries 
we also provide specialized insurance products such as personal accident  supplemental health and life insurance to individuals in select countries 
our reinsurance operations include both p c and life companies 
at december   ace had total assets of approximately billion and shareholders equity of approximately billion 
our product and geographic diversification differentiates us from the vast majority of our competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility 
our long term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income 
by doing so  we provide value to our clients and shareholders through the utilization of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
we are organized along a profit center structure by line of business and territory that does not necessarily correspond to corporate legal entities 
profit centers can access various legal entities  subject to licensing and other regulatory rules 
profit centers are expected to generate underwriting income and appropriate risk adjusted returns 
this corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center s senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base 
we are an underwriting organization and senior management is focused on delivering underwriting profit 
we strive to achieve underwriting income by only writing policies which we believe adequately compensate us for the risk we accept 
as an insurance and reinsurance company  we generate gross revenues from two principal sources premiums and investment income 
cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses  policy acquisition costs  and administrative expenses 
invested assets are substantially held in liquid  investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration 
we invest in equity securities in the us and international markets 
a small portion of our assets are held in less liquid or higher risk assets in an attempt to achieve higher risk adjusted returns 
claims payments in any short term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements 
the value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates  stock market volatility  and credit events such as corporate defaults 
the actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends  inflation rates  court awards  and catastrophes 
we believe that our cash balance  our highly liquid investments  credit facilities  and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead 
refer to liquidity and capital resources 
redomestication to zurich  switzerland in july  our shareholders approved proposals submitted by our board of directors to transfer our domicile from the cayman islands to zurich  in switzerland  our new jurisdiction of incorporation the continuation 
as a result of the continuation  we are deregistered in the cayman islands and are now subject to swiss law 
in connection with the continuation  we changed the currency in which the par value of our ordinary shares was stated from us dollars to swiss francs 
upon the effectiveness of the continuation  our ordinary shares became common shares 
all common shares are registered shares with a current par value of chf each 
notwithstanding the change of the currency in which the par value of common shares is stated  we continue to use us dollars as our reporting and functional currency for preparing our consolidated financial statements 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to pay dividends as a repayment of share capital in the form of a reduction in par value or qualified paid in capital  which would not be subject to swiss withholding tax

table of contents the combined insurance acquisition on april   ace acquired all of the outstanding shares of combined insurance and certain of its subsidiaries from aon corporation for billion 
combined insurance  founded in is headquartered in glenview  illinois  and is a leading underwriter and distributor of specialty individual accident and supplemental health insurance products targeted to middle income consumers in the us  europe  canada  and asia pacific 
combined insurance serves close to four million policyholders worldwide 
this acquisition has diversified our accident and health a h distribution capabilities by adding a significant agent base  while almost doubling our a h franchise 
we believe this will provide significant long term growth opportunities 
our a h operations have represented an increasing portion of our business in recent years 
within our a h operations including combined insurance  our primary business is personal accident 
we are not in the primary health care business 
our products include  but are not limited to  accidental death  accidental disability  supplemental medical  hospital indemnity  and income protection coverages 
with respect to our supplemental medical and hospital indemnity products  we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are  therefore  insulated from rising health care costs 
ace recorded the combined insurance acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
the interim consolidated financial statements include the results of combined insurance beginning april  the acquisition generated million of goodwill and other intangible assets  based on ace s purchase price allocation 
results from combined insurance s north american operations are included in ace s life insurance and reinsurance segment as the products are similar to our current life operations 
the results from combined insurance s international operations are included in ace s insurance overseas general segment as the products have similar economic characteristics and are distributed outside of the north american insurance markets

market conditions the property and casualty insurance industry began with excess underwriting capacity  as defined by availability of capital 
since then  natural catastrophes and financial market losses have destroyed a great deal of this excess capital 
additionally  downgrades and government ownership have impaired the ability of a number of companies to deploy their capital and operate in the same manner as they have in the past 
the p c underwriting environment  particularly rates  improved during the fourth quarter of and into the first quarter of this trend was more obvious in certain specialty and stressed classes 
the rate of change varies by territory  where the greatest improvements have been in north america  followed by the london company market  australia  and latin america 
we believe that due to our strong balance sheet  geographic presence  and product breadth  we are beginning to benefit from a flight to quality and where rate is adequate  we are writing more business  improving our position on accounts  and gaining market share 
where rate is not adequate  we are walking away and in some classes  continuing to shed business 
while the relationship between rates to risk exposure is improving  exposure is declining due to recession  resulting in improved underwriting margins but not necessarily more premium 
in north america  we are seeing substantially more opportunity to quote business as a result of market turmoil 
submissions are up significantly  though our quote to close ratios have dropped modestly given our pricing discipline 
in those lines where rate is adequate  we are benefiting from the weakness of others by improving our position on accounts  moving into primary lead or first excess position for example  in excess casualty  directors and officers liability d o  environmental and medical liability 
we are also gaining new business in certain lines where we already enjoy a strong lead position such as our e o business and risk management division 
there are also classes where our retention rates and new business writings are being negatively impacted by continued inadequate pricing such as both large account and catastrophe exposed property  e s casualty  and due to recession  construction related business 
our international business has also seen improvement in the fourth quarter of  our p c business in original currency experienced its best quarter of the year  increasing six percent over the third quarter  while a h was up percent over the same period 
we deliberately shrank our reinsurance business in  due to the competitive market conditions 
however  during the first quarter of  global reinsurance experienced improved pricing in many classes  and although us casualty remains competitive  we gained revenue from improved signings due to competitor weakness and more clients looking for a reinsurance solution to solve a capital need 
in reinsurance  we are noticing more clients willing to pay more though in most cases not dramatically more to have ace on their program 
although  the relationship between rates and risk exposure is improving and rates are improving  we cannot predict with any certainty how long these conditions will continue 
we believe that the current recession is impacting exposures and client s insurance budgets and this along with foreign exchange weakness relative to the us dollar  will negatively impact growth rates in 
table of contents we are continuing to invest in people and infrastructure to grow our presence in lines of businesses globally where we see an opportunity for ace to grow market share at reasonable terms 
we are also continuing to invest in our enterprise risk management capability  our systems and data environment  and our research and development capabilities 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include amounts that  either by their nature or due to requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  are determined using best estimates and assumptions 
while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment  actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented 
we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are unpaid loss and loss expense reserves  including long tail asbestos and environmental a e reserves  future policy benefits reserves  valuation of value of business acquired voba and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba  the assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts  reinsurance recoverable  including a provision for uncollectible reinsurance  impairments to the carrying value of our investment portfolio  the valuation of deferred tax assets  the valuation of derivative instruments related to guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib  and the valuation of goodwill 
we believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled prior period development  asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities  reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance  investments  net realized gains losses  and other income and expense items 
unpaid losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company  we are required  by applicable laws and regulations and gaap  to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers 
the estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but unpaid at the balance sheet date case reserves and for future obligations from claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr at the balance sheet date ibnr may also include a provision for additional development on reported claims in instances where the case reserve is viewed to be potentially insufficient 
the reserves provide for liabilities that exist for the company as of the balance sheet date 
the loss reserve also includes an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling these unpaid claims loss expenses 
at december   our gross unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were billion and our net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were billion 
with the exception of certain structured settlements  for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable  our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money 
in connection with such structured settlements  we carry reserves of million net of discount 
the table below presents a roll forward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses for the indicated periods 
in millions of us dollars gross losses reinsurance recoverable net losses balance at december  losses and loss expenses incurred losses and loss expenses paid other including foreign exchange revaluation balance at december  losses and loss expenses incurred losses and loss expenses paid other including foreign exchange revaluation losses and loss expenses acquired balance at december  
table of contents the process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances known at the date of accrual 
the following table shows our total reserves segregated between case reserves including loss expense reserves and ibnr reserves at december  and in millions of us dollars gross ceded net gross ceded net case reserves ibnr total the following table segregates the loss reserves by line of business including property and all other  casualty  and personal accident a h at december  and in the table  loss expenses are defined to include unallocated and allocated loss adjustment expenses 
for certain lines  in particular ace international and ace bermuda products  loss adjustment expenses are partially included in ibnr and partially included in loss expenses 
in millions of us dollars gross ceded net gross ceded net property and all other case reserves loss expenses ibnr subtotal casualty case reserves loss expenses ibnr subtotal a h case reserves loss expenses ibnr subtotal total case reserves loss expenses ibnr total the judgments used to estimate unpaid loss and loss expense reserves require different considerations depending upon the individual circumstances underlying the insured loss 
for example  the reserves established for high excess casualty claims  a e claims  claims from major catastrophic events  or the ibnr for our various product lines each require different assumptions and judgments to be made 
necessary judgments are based on numerous factors and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  as new or improved methods are developed  or as laws change 
hence  ultimate loss payments may differ from the estimate of the ultimate liabilities made at the balance sheet date 
changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results by worsening our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be deficient or improving our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant 
the potential for variation in loss reserves is impacted by numerous factors  which we discuss below 

table of contents we establish loss and loss expense reserves for our liabilities from claims for all of the insurance and reinsurance business that we write 
for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to us prior to the balance sheet date  and where we have sufficient information  our claims personnel establish case reserves as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim s  standard claim handling practices  and professional judgment 
in respect of those claims that have been incurred but not reported prior to the balance sheet date  there is by definition limited actual information to form the case reserve estimate and reliance is placed upon historical loss experience and actuarial methods to project the ultimate loss obligations and the corresponding amount of ibnr 
furthermore  for our assumed reinsurance operation  global reinsurance  an additional case reserve may be established above the amount notified by the ceding company if the notified case reserve is judged to be insufficient by global reinsurance s claims department refer to assumed reinsurance below 
we have actuarial staff within each of our operating segments who analyze loss reserves and regularly project estimates of ultimate losses and the required ibnr reserve 
ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate amount of expected claims for a product line and subtracting paid losses and case reserves for reported claims 
the judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses may involve the use and interpretation of various actuarial projection methods that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data  loss development patterns and industry data as needed 
the estimate of the ibnr reserve also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of more contemporary  qualitative  and subjective factors 
among some of the factors that might be considered are changes in business mix or volume  changes in ceded reinsurance structures  reported and projected loss trends  inflation  legal environment  and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties 
typically  for each product line  one or more standard actuarial reserving methods may be used to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses  and from these estimates a single actuarial central estimate is selected 
exceptions to the use of standard actuarial projection methods occur for individual claims of significance that require complex legal  claims  and actuarial analysis and judgment for example  a e account projections or high excess casualty accounts in litigation or product lines where the nature of the claims experience and or availability of the data prevent application of such methods 
in addition  claims arising from catastrophic events require evaluation based upon our exposure at the time of the event and the circumstances of the catastrophe and its post event impact that do not utilize standard actuarial loss projection methods 
the standard actuarial reserving methods may include  but are not necessarily limited to  paid and reported loss development  expected loss ratio  and bornhuetter ferguson methods 
a general description of these methods is provided below 
in the subsequent discussion on short and long tail business  reference is also made where appropriate to how consideration in method selection impacted results 
in addition to these standard methods  we may use other recognized actuarial methods and approaches depending upon the product line characteristics and available data 
to ensure that the projections of future loss emergence based on historical loss development patterns are representative of the underlying business  the historical loss and premium data is required to be of sufficient homogeneity and credibility 
for example  to improve data homogeneity  we may group product line data further by similar risk attribute eg  geography  coverage such as property versus liability exposure  or origin year  project losses for these homogenous groups and then combine these results to provide the overall product line estimate 
the premium and loss data is aggregated by origin year eg  the year in which the losses were incurred or accident year and annual or quarterly development periods subsequent to the origin year 
implicit in the standard actuarial methods that we generally utilize is the need for two fundamental assumptions first  the expected loss ratio for each origin year ie  accident  report  or underwriting and second  the pattern by which losses are expected to emerge over time for each origin year 
the expected loss ratio for any particular origin year is selected after consideration of a number of factors  including historical loss ratios adjusted for intervening premium and loss trends  industry benchmarks  the results of policy level loss modeling at the time of underwriting  and other more subjective considerations for the product line and external environment as noted above 
for the more recent origin years  the expected loss ratio for a given origin year is established at the start of the origin year as part of the planning process 
this analysis is performed in conjunction with underwriters and management 
the expected loss ratio method arrives at an ultimate loss estimate by multiplying the expected ultimate loss ratio by the corresponding premium base 
this method is most commonly used for immature origin periods on product lines where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet deemed sufficiently credible to warrant consideration in the selection of ultimate losses 
the expected loss ratio for a given origin year may be modified over time if the underlying assumptions such as loss trend or premium rate changes differ from the original assumptions 
our assumed paid and reported development patterns provide a benchmark against which the actual emerging loss experience can be monitored 
where possible  development patterns are selected based on historical loss emergence by origin year with appropriate allowance for changes in business mix  claims handling process  or ceded reinsurance that are likely to lead to a discernible difference between the rate of historical and future loss emergence 
for product lines where the historical data 
table of contents is viewed to have low statistical credibility  the selected development patterns also reflect relevant industry benchmarks and or experience from similar product lines written elsewhere within ace 
this typically arises for product lines that are relatively immature or for high severity low frequency portfolios where our historical experience exhibits considerable volatility and or lacks credibility 
the paid and reported loss development methods convert the assumed loss emergence pattern to a set of multiplicative factors which are then applied to actual paid or reported losses to arrive at an estimate of ultimate losses for each period 
due to their multiplicative nature  the paid and reported loss development methods magnify differences between actual and expected loss emergence 
these methods tend to be utilized for more mature origin periods and for those portfolios where the loss emergence has been relatively consistent over time 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is essentially a combination of the expected loss ratio method and the loss development method  under which the loss development method is given more weight as the origin year matures 
this approach allows a logical transition between the expected loss ratio method which is generally utilized at earlier maturities and the loss development methods which are typically utilized at latter maturities 
we usually apply this method using reported loss data although paid data may be used 
the applicability of actuarial methods will also be impacted by the attachment point of the policy or contract with the insured or ceding company 
in the case of low attachment points typical of primary or working layer reinsurance  the experience tends to be more frequency driven 
these product types allow for the standard actuarial methods to be used in determining loss reserve levels  as they often have a sufficient history and volume of claims experience to be credible 
in the case of high attachment points typical of excess insurance or excess of loss reinsurance  the experience tends to be severity driven  as only a loss of significant size will enter the layer 
for structured or unique contracts  most common to the financial solutions business which we have considerably curtailed and  to a lesser extent  our reinsurance business  we typically supplement the standard actuarial methods with an analysis of each contract s terms  original pricing information  subsequent internal and external analyses of the ongoing contracts  market exposures and history  and qualitative input from claims managers 
our recorded reserves represent management s best estimate of the provision for unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date 
we perform an actuarial reserve review for each product line and establish an actuarial central estimate at the review s conclusion 
the process to select the actuarial central estimate  when more than one estimate is available  may differ across product lines 
for example  an actuary may base the central estimate on loss projections developed using an incurred loss development approach instead of a paid loss development approach when reported losses are viewed to be a more credible indication of the ultimate loss compared with paid losses 
the availability of estimates by different projection techniques will depend upon the product line  the underwriting circumstances  and the maturity of the loss emergence 
for a well established product line with sufficient volume and history  the actuarial central estimate may be drawn from a weighting of paid and reported loss development and or bornhuetter ferguson methods 
however  for a new long tail product line for which we have limited data and experience or a rapidly growing line  the emerging loss experience may not have sufficient credibility to allow selection of loss development or bornhuetter ferguson methods and reliance may be placed upon the expected loss ratio method until the experience matures 
management s best estimate is developed from the actuarial central estimate after collaboration with actuaries  underwriting  claims  legal  and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees 
each business unit reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial  finance  claims  and senior management and has the responsibility for finalizing and approving the estimate to be used as management s best estimate 
reserves are further reviewed by ace limited s chief actuary and senior management 
the objective of such a process is to determine a single estimate that we believe represents a better estimate than any other 
such an estimate is viewed by management to be the best estimate of ultimate loss settlements and is determined based on several factors including  but not limited to segmentation of data to provide sufficient homogeneity and credibility for loss projection methods  extent of internal historical loss data  and industry information where required  historical variability of loss estimates compared with actual loss experience  perceived credibility of emerged loss experience  and nature and extent of underlying assumptions 
management does not build in any specific provision for uncertainty 
we do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates for our individual loss reserve studies 
ranges are not necessarily a true reflection of the potential difference between loss reserves estimated at the balance sheet date and the ultimate settlement value of losses 
this is due to the fact that an actuarial range is developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas actual prior period development reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements relates in part to events and circumstances that were unknown as of the original valuation date 
while we believe that our recorded reserves are 
table of contents reasonable and represent management s best estimate for each product line as of the current valuation date  future changes to our view of the ultimate liabilities are possible 
a five percent change in our net loss reserves equates to billion and represents eight percent of shareholders equity at december  historically  including a e reserve charges  our reserves  at times  have developed in excess of percent of recorded amounts 
refer to analysis of losses and loss expense development under item for a summary of historical volatility between estimated loss reserves and ultimate loss settlements 
we perform internal loss reserve studies for all product lines at least once a year  the timing of such studies varies throughout the year 
additionally  each quarter for most product lines  we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations 
if warranted from findings in loss emergence tests  we will accelerate the timing of our product line reserve studies 
finally  loss reserve studies are performed annually by external third parties and the findings are used to test the reasonability of our internal findings 
the time period between the date of loss occurrence and the final payment date of the ensuing claim s is referred to as the claim tail 
the following is a discussion of specific reserving considerations for both short tail and long tail product lines 
in this section  we reference the nature of recent prior period development to give a high level understanding of how these considerations translate through the reserving process into financial decisions 
refer to segment operating results for more information on prior period development 
short tail business short tail business generally describes product lines for which losses are usually known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs 
this would include  for example  most property  personal accident  aviation hull  and automobile physical damage policies that are written by ace 
there are some exceptions on certain product lines or events eg  major hurricanes where the event has occurred  but the final settlement amount is highly variable and not known with certainty for a potentially lengthy period 
due to the short reporting development pattern for these product lines  our estimate of ultimate losses from any particular accident period responds quickly to the latest loss data 
we typically assign credibility to methods that incorporate actual loss emergence  such as the paid and reported loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods  sooner than would be the case for long tail lines at a similar stage of development for a given origin year 
the reserving process for short tail losses arising from catastrophic events typically involves the determination by the claims department  in conjunction with underwriters and actuaries  of our exposure and estimated losses immediately following an event and then subsequent revisions of the estimated losses as our insureds provide updated actual loss information 
for the origin year  the short tail line loss reserves were typically established using the expected loss ratio method for the non catastrophe exposures 
reserves were also established for losses arising on catastrophe activity during the underlying calculation for the non catastrophe losses requires initial expected loss ratios by product line adjusted for actual experience during the calendar year 
as previously noted  the derivation of initial loss ratios incorporates actuarial projections of prior years losses  past and future loss and exposure trends  rate adequacy for new and renewal business  and ceded reinsurance coverage and costs 
we also considered our view of the impact of terms and conditions and the market environment  which by their nature tend to be more judgmental relative to other factors 
for our short tail businesses taken as a whole  overall loss trend assumptions did not differ significantly relative to prior years 
because there is some degree of random volatility of non catastrophe loss experience from year to year  we considered average loss experience over several years when developing loss estimates for the current accident year 
therefore  while there has been favorable loss development in recent years on non catastrophe exposures  the effect of this favorable development on expected loss ratios for the current accident year is relatively small 
further  other considerations  such as rate reductions and broadening of terms and conditions in a competitive market somewhat offset the impact of recent favorable loss development 
in terms of prior accident years  the bulk of the changes made in the calendar year arose from the and accident years 
specifically  the insurance north american  insurance overseas general  and global reinsurance segments experienced million  million  and million of favorable development  respectively  primarily due to lower than anticipated loss emergence on the and accident years 
in the insurance north american and insurance overseas general segments  these prior period movements were primarily the result of changes to the ultimate loss estimates for the and accident years in response to the latest reported loss data rather than any significant changes to underlying actuarial assumptions such as loss development patterns 
in the global reinsurance segment  the prior period movements were primarily the result of changes to the ultimate loss estimates for the accident years that resulted from a detailed review 
the changes to the ultimate losses were principally related to recognition of the latest reported loss data rather than any significant changes to underlying actuarial assumptions such as loss development patterns 

table of contents for a detailed analysis of changes in assumptions related to prior accident year reserves during calendar year  refer to prior period development 
long tail business long tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known for some period and claims can take significant time to emerge 
this includes most casualty lines such as general liability  d o  and workers compensation 
there are many factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long tail business 
among these are our historical loss data and experience is often too immature and lacking in credibility to rely upon for reserving purposes 
where this is the case  in our reserve analysis we rely on industry loss ratios or industry benchmark development patterns that we believe reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development  where available 
for such product lines  actual loss experience may differ from industry loss statistics as well as loss experience for previous underwriting years  the inherent uncertainty around loss trends  claims inflation eg  medical and judicial and underlying economic conditions  the inherent uncertainty of the estimated duration of the paid and reporting loss development patterns beyond the historical record requires that professional judgment be used in the determination of the length of the patterns based on the historical data and other information  the inherent uncertainty of assuming that historical paid and reported loss development patterns for older origin years will be representative of subsequent loss emergence on recent origin years 
for example  changes over time in the processes and procedures for establishing case reserves can distort reported loss development patterns or changes in ceded reinsurance structures by origin year can distort the development of paid and reported losses  loss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics in some manner 
if data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics  such as loss payment patterns  the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected 
additionally  since casualty lines of business can have significant intricacies in the terms and conditions afforded to the insured  there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses  and the applicability of the price change data used to estimate ultimate loss ratios for most recent origin years 
as can be seen from the above  various factors are considered when determining appropriate data  assumptions  and methods used to establish the loss reserve for the long tail product lines 
these factors will also vary by origin year for given product lines 
the derivation of loss development patterns from data and the selection of a tail factor to project ultimate losses from actual loss emergence require considerable judgment  particularly with respect to the extent to which historical loss experience is relied upon to support changes in key reserving assumptions 
examples of the relationship between changes in historical loss experience and key reserving assumptions are provided below 
for those long tail product lines that are less claim frequency and more claim severity oriented  such as professional lines and high excess casualty  we placed more reliance upon expert legal and claims review of the specific circumstance underlying reported cases rather than loss development patterns 
the assumptions used for these lines of business are updated over time to reflect new claim and legal advice judged to be of significance 
for the origin year  loss reserves were typically established through the application of individual product line expected loss ratios that contemplated assumptions similar in nature to those noted in the short tail line discussion 
our assumptions on loss trend and development patterns reflect reliance on our historical loss data provided the length of history and homogeneity afford credibility 
given the recent growth on a number of product lines  such as general casualty and financial lines  our historical loss data is less extensive and our assumptions require judgmental use of industry loss trends and development patterns 
we note that industry patterns are not always available to match the nature of the business being written  this issue is particularly problematic for non us exposed lines 
given the underlying volatility of the long tail product lines and the lengthy period required for full paid and reported loss emergence  we typically assign little to no credibility to actual loss emergence in the early development periods 
accordingly  we generally used the expected loss ratio method for the and immediately preceding origin years to establish reserves by product line 
we monitor actual paid and reported loss emergence relative to expected loss emergence for most individual product lines 
while recent experience has generally been favorable relative to our expectations  we do not yet believe that this favorable experience is sufficiently credible for us to consider moving to loss based projection methods in setting reserves for the more recent years 
given the nature of long tail casualty business and related reserving considerations  for the major long tail lines in insurance north american  insurance overseas general  and global reinsurance  no changes of significance were made to 
table of contents the key actuarial assumptions for the loss trend aside from changes to inflation assumptions  exposure trend  and loss development patterns used to establish the accident year reserves relative to prior accident years 
to the extent that actual loss emergence in calendar year differed from our expectation for the more recent origin years  the deviation was not typically seen as sufficiently credible  particularly given the volatility and lengthy period for full loss emergence  to alter either our booked ultimate loss selections or the actuarial assumptions underlying the reserve reviews 
such judgments were made with due consideration to the factors impacting reserve uncertainty as discussed above 
however  for some product lines  credibility was assigned to emerging loss experience and this is discussed further below and in the section entitled prior period development 
for the and origin years  our best estimate reflects what we believe to be our exposure to credit crunch related claims primarily e o and d o based on information received to date 
for more mature accident years  typically and prior  we relied upon paid and reported loss development patterns for older origin years where sufficient credibility existed 
for those lines where the historical experience lacked credibility  we placed reliance upon the latest benchmark patterns where available from external industry bodies such as insurance services office iso or the national council on compensation insurance  inc ncci 
accordingly  the assumptions used to project loss estimates will not fully reflect our own actual loss experience until our data is deemed sufficiently credible 
in contrast to short tail lines  the prior period development in for long tail lines of business arose across a number of accident years in the insurance north american and insurance overseas general segments  typically in more mature origin years 
the movements were generally the result of actual loss emergence in calendar year that differed notably from the expected loss emergence and where such deviations were deemed significant enough to warrant revising the projections for certain product lines 
the nature of the changes to the assumptions in  and the associated impact on the prior accident years  varies by product line 
for example  in insurance north american the changes to recorded estimates for national account casualty lines  medical risk lines  and canada p c operations involved assigning greater credibility to actual loss experience  ie more weight was given to paid and reported loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods rather than the expected loss ratio methods mainly on accident years and prior 
this resulted in million  million  and million of favorable development  respectively 
similarly  for the ace international division within insurance overseas general  there was million of favorable development mainly on accident years and prior as more weight was given to paid and reported loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods rather than the expected loss ratio methods 
for a detailed analysis of changes in assumptions related to prior accident year reserves during calendar year  refer to prior period development 
while we believe that our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december   is adequate  new information or emerging trends that differ from our assumptions may lead to future development of losses and loss expenses significantly greater or less than the reserve provided  which could have a material effect on future operating results 
as noted previously  our best estimate of required loss reserves for most portfolios is judgmentally selected for each origin year after considering the results from any number of reserving methods and is not a purely mechanical process 
therefore  it is difficult to convey  in a simple and quantitative manner  the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate 
in the examples shown below  we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described 
we consider each of the following sensitivity analyses to represent a reasonably likely deviation in the underlying assumption 
insurance north american given the long reporting and paid development patterns  the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for claims covered by our inactive middle market workers compensation business requires considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves 
specifically  when applying the paid loss development method  a one percent change in the tail factor ie  changed to either or would cause a change of approximately million  either positively or negatively  for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves 
this is relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately million 
our ace bermuda operations write predominantly high excess liability coverage on an occurrence first reported basis typically with attachment points in excess of million and gross limits of million or less and d o and other professional liability coverage on a claims made basis typically with attachment points in excess of million and gross limits of million or less 
claims development for this business can vary significantly for individual claims and historically could vary by as much as million per claim for professional liability and million per claim for excess liability depending on the nature of the loss 

table of contents insurance overseas general certain long tail lines  such as casualty and professional lines  are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation 
heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world are increasing the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty in the reserving estimates 
our reserving methods rely on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment  it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments 
for example  when applying the reported loss development method  the lengthening by six months of our selected loss development patterns would increase reserve estimates on long tail casualty and professional lines for accident years by approximately million 
this movement is relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately billion for these years 
global reinsurance typically  there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reported development patterns  especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers compensation or general liability  which may take up to years to fully develop 
this uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns due to the sometimes low credibility of the data 
the underlying source and selection of the final development patterns can thus have a significant impact on the selected net losses and loss expenses ultimate 
for example  a twenty percent shortening or lengthening of the development patterns used for us long tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate derived by the reported bornhuetter ferguson method for these lines to change by approximately million 
this movement is relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately billion 
assumed reinsurance at december   net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to billion  consisting of million of case reserves and billion of ibnr 
in comparison  at december   net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to billion  consisting of million of case reserves and billion of ibnr 
for catastrophe business  we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information  including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants  ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers  and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event 
our internal data analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves 
for our casualty reinsurance business  we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses 
due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies  as well as other factors  the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business 
these include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following the reported claims information could be inaccurate  typically  a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim 
the use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag 
because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers  ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers  who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty 
the reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations 
therefore  the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines  and the historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available 
further  for certain coverages or products  such as excess of loss contracts  there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability 
in such cases  the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources 
we mitigate the above risks in several ways 
in addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable  we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate  complete  and timely 
as appropriate  audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process 
we also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses 

table of contents on occasion  there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves reported by the ceding companies 
this is due to the fact that we receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies only with respect to case reserves 
for ibnr  we use historical experience and other statistical information  depending on the type of business  to estimate the ultimate loss 
we estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty s coverage basis ie  risks attaching or losses occurring 
at december   the case reserves reported to us by our ceding companies were million  compared with the million we recorded 
our policy is to post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant 
within the insurance north american segment  we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run off since unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run off reinsurance business resides within the brandywine division of our insurance north american segment 
most of the remaining unpaid losses and loss expense reserves for the run off reinsurance business relate to a e claims 
refer to asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities for more information 
asbestos and environmental reserves included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are liabilities for asbestos and environmental claims and expenses 
these claims are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily injury claims related to exposure to asbestos products and environmental hazards 
the estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to the recent legal environment  including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims 
during  we conducted an internal  ground up review of our consolidated a e liabilities as of december  during the same period  a team of external actuaries performed an evaluation as to the adequacy of the reserves of century 
this external review was conducted in accordance with the brandywine restructuring order  which requires that an independent actuarial review of century s reserves be completed every two years 
management takes full responsibility for the estimation of its a e liabilities 
as a result of our internal review  we increased our net loss reserves for the brandywine operations  including a e  by million  while the gross loss reserves increased by million 
the conclusions of the external review provided estimates of ultimate net brandywine liabilities that are little changed from a comparable study in we also decreased our net loss reserves for westchester specialty s a e and other liabilities by million  while the gross loss reserves decreased by million 
our a e reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated future changes in the legal  social or economic environment  or any benefit from future legislative reforms 
there are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome 
we believe the most significant variables relating to our a e reserves include assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims  the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure  the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to non products coverage  whether high level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholders claim trends and liability situation  and payments to unimpaired claimants and the potential liability of peripheral defendants 
based on the policies  the facts  the law  and a careful analysis of the impact that these factors will likely have on any given account  we estimate the potential liability for indemnity  policyholder defense costs  and coverage litigation expense 
the results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carriers  policyholders  and claimants 
refer to asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities for more information 
future policy benefits reserves we issue contracts in our insurance overseas general and life insurance and reinsurance segments that are classified as long duration 
these contracts generally include accident and supplemental health products  term and whole life products  and endowment products 
we establish reserves for contracts determined to be long duration based on approved actuarial methods that include assumptions related to expenses  mortality  morbidity  persistency  and investment yields with a factor for adverse deviation 
these assumptions are locked in at the inception of the contract 
the future policy benefit reserve balance is regularly evaluated for a premium deficiency 

table of contents as part of purchase accounting related to the combined insurance acquisition  we applied fair value accounting to the future policy benefit reserves acquired 
an additional liability resulted primarily as a result of using current interest rates and an adjusted risk margin 
we applied this fair value adjustment by essentially unlocking the future policy benefit reserves and then locking in the new assumptions which will be subject to the same premium deficiency analysis as the original reserves 
valuation of value of business acquired voba and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba as part of the combined insurance acquisition  we established an intangible asset related to voba 
the valuation of voba is derived from similar assumptions to those used to establish the associated future policy benefit reserve 
the most significant input in this calculation is the discount rate used to present value the net cash flows 
we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs associated with long duration contracts and voba collectively dac over the estimated life of the contracts in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
the estimated life is established at the inception of the contracts or upon acquisition and is based on current persistency assumptions 
dac is tested along with the future policy benefit reserves regularly for premium deficiencies of which we have not identified any significant deficiencies 
risk transfer in the ordinary course of business  we both purchase or cede and sell or assume reinsurance protection 
in  as a matter of policy  we discontinued the purchase of all finite reinsurance contracts 
for both ceded and assumed reinsurance  risk transfer requirements must be met in order to use reinsurance accounting  principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses 
if risk transfer requirements are not met  a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit  typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense 
to meet risk transfer requirements  a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk  consisting of underwriting and timing risk  and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity 
we also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit 
contracts that include fixed premium ie  premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment 
reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions  such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience  and relatively low policy limits as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits  can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met 
for such contracts  often referred to as finite or structured products  we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception 
to support risk transfer  the cash flow analyses must demonstrate that a significant loss is reasonably possible  such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds percent 
for purposes of cash flow analyses  we generally use a risk free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments 
in addition  to support insurance risk  we must prove the reinsurer s risk of loss varies with that of the reinsured and or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss 
to ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed  qualitative and quantitative risk transfer analyses and memoranda supporting risk transfer are developed by underwriters for all structured products 
we have established protocols for structured products that include criteria triggering an accounting review of the contract prior to quoting 
if any criterion is triggered  a contract must be reviewed by a committee established by each of our operating segments with reporting oversight  including peer review  from our global structured transaction review committee 
with respect to ceded reinsurance  we entered into a few multi year excess of loss retrospectively rated contracts  principally in  some of which remain in force 
these contracts principally provide severity protection for specific product divisions 
because traditional one year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly  these contracts were generally entered into to secure a more cost effective reinsurance program 
all of these contracts transferred risk and have been accounted for as reinsurance 
in addition  we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to  such as the national indemnity company nico contracts referred to in the section entitled  asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities 
subsequent to the ace ina acquisition  we have not purchased any retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts 
with respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts  products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer were primarily sold by our financial solutions business 
although we have significantly curtailed writing financial solutions business  several contracts remain in force and principally include multi year retrospectively rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers 
because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products  relatively few insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had 
table of contents not been met 
for certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits  the insured desired to self insure a risk but was required  legally or otherwise  to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non payment from the insured 
a significant portion of ace tempest re usa s business is written through quota share treaties approximately million of net premiums earned in  comprised of million of first dollar quota share treaties and million of excess quota share treaties  a small portion of which are categorized as structured products 
structured quota share treaties typically contain relatively low aggregate policy limits  a feature that reduces loss coverage in some manner and a profit sharing provision 
reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses reinsurance recoverable includes the balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses and is presented net of a provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors 
ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
we determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts subject to the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
the recognition of reinsurance recoverable requires two key judgments 
the first judgment involves our estimation based on the amount of gross reserves and the percentage of that amount which may be ceded to reinsurers 
ceded ibnr  which is a major component of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses  is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and  consequently  this estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross reserves 
refer to critical accounting estimates unpaid losses and loss expenses 
the second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we may ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency  contractual dispute  or for other reasons 
amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable asset and  in turn  shareholders equity 
changes in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income 
although the contractual obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions  the collectability of such amounts requires estimation by management 
the majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until sometime in the future  and the duration of our recoverables may be longer than the duration of our direct exposures 
over this period of time  economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so  they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us 
to estimate the provision for uncollectible reinsurance  the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer 
this determination is based on a process rather than an estimate  although an element of judgment must be applied 
as part of the process  ceded reserves are allocated to reinsurance contracts because ceded reserves are not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis 
the allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance contracts  adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses 
if actual experience varies materially from historical experience  including that used to determine ceded premium  the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will change 
while such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance  it could  nevertheless  have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded 
generally  we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance 
the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer  net of collateral  and default factors used to estimate the probability that the reinsurer may be unable to meet its future obligations in full 
the definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in an ace only beneficiary trust  letters of credit  and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset 
we do not currently include multi beneficiary trusts 
however  we have several reinsurers that have established multi beneficiary trusts for which certain of our companies are beneficiaries 
the determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer and a corresponding default factor applicable to the financial strength rating 
default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating  or rating equivalent  of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions 
significant considerations and assumptions include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following for reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency  and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population ie  default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and 
table of contents payment durations conform to averages  the judgment exercised by management to determine the provision for uncollectible reinsurance of each reinsurer is typically limited because the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor we apply is based on a default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class 
default factors applied for financial ratings of aaa  aa  a  bbb  bb  b  and ccc  are percent  percent  percent  percent  percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
because the model we use is predicated on capital charges previously applied by a major rating agency  we do not generally consider alternative factors 
however  when a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly rated reinsurer  such as certain property catastrophe claims  a default factor may not be applied  for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent  affiliate  or peer company  we determine a rating equivalent based on an analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity  industry benchmarks  or other factors as considered appropriate 
we then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class 
for balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which we have not adopted a rating equivalent  we generally apply a default factor of percent  for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision  we establish a default factor and resulting provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding each company 
upon initial notification of an insolvency  we generally recognize expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding  net of collateral  through a combination of write offs of recoverable balances and increases to the provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
when regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer  we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding  net of collateral 
when sufficient credible information becomes available  we adjust the provision for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received  and for captives and other recoverables  management determines the provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on the specific facts and circumstances 
the following table summarizes reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses as well as the provision for uncollectible reinsurance for each type of reinsurance recoverable balance at december  in millions of us dollars reinsurance recoverables on losses and loss expenses recoverables net of usable collateral provision for uncollectible reinsurance type reinsurers with credit ratings reinsurers not rated reinsurers under supervision and insolvent reinsurers captives other structured settlements and pools total at december   the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry  such as a large number of major catastrophes  actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and our liquidity 
given the various considerations used to estimate our uncollectible provision  we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
however  based on the composition particularly the average credit quality of the reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses at december   we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch for all rated reinsurers i 
e  from a to a or a to bbb could increase our provision for uncollectible reinsurance by approximately million or approximately one percent of the reinsurance recoverable balance  assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation 
while a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in our provision for uncollectible reinsurance and a charge to earnings in that period  a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will be unable to collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question

table of contents investments our fixed maturity investments are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
our available for sale portfolio is reported at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in shareholders equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
fair value is determined using observable inputs where available such as the quoted market price of these securities provided by either independent pricing services  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications 
if significant observable inputs are unavailable  we rely on unobservable inputs to determine fair value 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for more information 
we regularly review our impaired investments ie  those debt securities for which fair value is below amortized cost or those equity securities for which fair value is below cost for other than temporary impairment 
if we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary  we record the decline as an unrealized loss in shareholders equity 
if we believe the decline is other than temporary  we write down the book value of the investment and record a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
an impairment is considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment to recovery of the cost of the investment  and evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period outweighs evidence to the contrary 
the determination as to whether or not the decline is other than temporary principally requires the following critical judgments i the circumstances that require management to make a specific assessment as to whether or not the decline is other than temporary  such as the time period an investment has been in a loss position and the significance of the decline  and ii for those securities to be assessed  whether we have the ability and intent to hold the security through an expected recovery period  absent a significant change in facts that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on either the financial markets or the financial position of the issuer 
given current market conditions  and in light of recent general guidance from the sec and the fasb regarding the application of existing guidance during stressed market conditions  beginning in the third quarter of we have qualitatively evaluated our application of the parameters under which we consider a decline in value to be other than temporary 
similar to prior quarters  we evaluated investments in our portfolio where cost exceeded fair value and made certain judgments as to our ability to recover our cost 
our analysis in the third and fourth quarters of required we consider carefully the duration and severity of decline and the root causes thereof 
specifically  we further evaluated whether declines were related to temporary liquidity concerns and current market conditions  and therefore more likely to be temporary  or were instead related to specific credit events or issuer performance  and therefore more likely to be other than temporarily impaired 
using this refined evaluation process resulted in a lower dollar value of investments in an unrealized loss position being deemed other than temporarily impaired in comparison to our previous evaluation process 
we believe the underlying credit quality of the portfolio supports the use of our modified approach 
refer to note e to the consolidated financial statements  under item  which includes a table that summarizes all of our securities in an unrealized loss position at december  with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
subsequent decisions on security sales are the result of changing or unforeseen facts and circumstances eg  arising from a large insured loss such as a catastrophe  deterioration of the credit worthiness of the issuer or its industry  or changes in regulatory requirements 
we believe that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of the majority of the portfolio as available for sale 
the gross unrealized loss at december   for all securities in a loss position was billion with million in an unrealized loss position for over months million was related to fixed maturities held to maturity 
our net realized losses in included write downs of billion of which million was related to fixed maturities 
this compares with write downs of million and million in and  respectively 
the other than temporary impairments recorded in were primarily due to an increase in market interest rates resulting from volatility and widening credit spreads  issuer defaults  of which lehman brothers was the most significant to us  and significant declines in global equity markets 
the other than temporary impairments recorded in and were primarily due to an increase in market interest rates from the date of security purchase and as such  were not credit related 
because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets and a multiple of shareholders equity  adverse changes in economic conditions subsequent to the balance sheet date could result in other than temporary impairments that are material to our financial condition and operating results 
such economic changes could arise from overall changes in the financial markets and specific changes to industries  companies  or foreign governments in which we maintain relatively large investment holdings 
further  an increase in interest rates could result in an increased number of fixed maturities for which we cannot support the intent to hold to recovery 
more information regarding our process for reviewing our portfolio for possible impairments can be found in the section entitled net realized gains losses 

table of contents deferred tax assets many of our insurance businesses operate in income tax paying jurisdictions 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each tax jurisdiction 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was billion 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for more information 
at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction  principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies 
projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience 
the valuation allowance is also based on maintaining our ability and intent to hold our us fixed maturities to recovery 
if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax paying component prove to be incorrect  or future market events occur that prevent our ability to hold our us fixed maturities to recovery  an additional valuation allowance could become necessary 
this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
at december   the valuation allowance of million including million with respect to foreign tax credits reflects management s assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the inability of certain foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income and the inability of ace group holdings and its subsidiaries to utilize foreign tax credits 
guaranteed minimum income benefits derivatives under reinsurance programs covering living benefit guarantees  we assume the risk of guaranteed minimum income benefits associated with variable annuity contracts 
our gmib reinsurance product meets the definition of a derivative for accounting purposes and is therefore carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net realized gains losses in the period of the change pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
we believe that the most meaningful presentation of these derivatives is to reflect cash inflows or revenue as net premiums earned  and to record estimates of the average modeled value of future cash outflows as incurred losses 
accordingly  we recognize benefit reserves consistent with aicpa statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain non traditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop 
changes in this reserve are included in life underwriting income 
the incremental difference between fair value and sop benefit reserves is reflected in other assets or other liabilities in the balance sheet and related changes in fair value are reflected in net realized gains losses in the consolidated statement of operations 
we intend to hold these derivative contracts to maturity ie  the expiration of the underlying annuities through lapses  annuitization or death 
at maturity  the cumulative gains and losses will net to zero because  over time  the insurance liability will be increased or decreased to equal our obligation 
refer to note j to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for further description of this product and related accounting treatment 
for a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates  equity indices and other assumptions on the fair value of gmibs  and the resulting impact on our net income  refer to item a 
the fair value of gmib reinsurance is estimated using an internal valuation model which includes current market information and estimates of policyholder behavior from the perspective of a theoretical market participant 
all of our treaties contain claim limits  which are factored into the valuation model 
the fair value depends on a number of factors  including interest rates  current account value  market volatility  expected annuitization rates and other policyholder behavior  and changes in policyholder mortality 
the model and related assumptions are continuously re evaluated by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based upon additional experience obtained related to policyholder behavior and availability of more timely market information  such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products  actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and the differences may be material 
the most significant policyholder behavior assumptions include lapse rates and annuitization rates using the guaranteed benefit gmib annuitization rate 
assumptions regarding lapse rates and gmib annuitization rates differ by treaty but the underlying methodology to determine rates applied to each treaty is comparable 
the assumptions regarding lapse and gmib annuitization rates determined for each treaty are based on a dynamic calculation that uses several underlying factors 

table of contents a lapse rate is the percentage of in force policies surrendered in a given calendar year 
all else equal  as lapse rates increase  ultimate claim payments will decrease 
the gmib annuitization rate is the percentage of policies for which the customer will elect to annuitize using the guaranteed benefit provided under the gmib 
all else equal  as gmib annuitization rates increase  ultimate claim payments will increase  subject to treaty claim limits 
key factors affecting the lapse rate assumption include investment performance and policy duration 
we generally assume that lapse rates increase with policy duration with a significant increase in rates after the end of the surrender charge period 
as investment performance of underlying fund investments declines  and guarantees become more valuable  lapse rates are anticipated to decrease thereby increasing the expected value of claims on minimum guarantees and thus benefit reserves and the incremental fair value liability 
key factors affecting the gmib annuitization rate include investment performance and interest rates after the gmib waiting period 
as investment performance of underlying fund investments declines  the monthly income available to a policyholder who annuitizes their account value falls  this makes the gmib more valuable 
as the gmib becomes more valuable  our modeling assumes that annuitization rates will increase  resulting in higher benefit reserves and fair value liability 
the same is true in an environment where long term interest rates are decreasing 
prior to  we had very limited actual reported experience related to annuitization rates and relied primarily on judgment to determine this assumption 
during  actual annuitization experience  as well as available industry experience  has developed to allow us to refine this assumption 
as a result of our normal quarterly reserve review we made several assumption changes in our variable annuity valuation models in the fourth quarter of  the most meaningful of which were related to mortality and annuitization behavior 
these changes  which had both a positive and negative impact  were made in response to a combination of emerging new and validated experience on the ace business and industry data we obtained in the fourth quarter of and in aggregate benefited net income by approximately million 
the vast majority of which is related to the impact of assumption changes on the fair value liability affecting all future cash flows on a present value basis in income in the current period 
net realized losses for included million for gmib reinsurance excluding realized gains of million on derivative instruments held to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio 
these losses were principally driven by decreasing interest rates and equity markets

ace tempest life re employs a strategy to manage the financial market and policyholder behavior risks embedded in the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees 
risk management begins with underwriting a prospective client and guarantee design  with particular focus on protecting ace s position from policyholder options that  because of anti selective behavior  could adversely impact our obligation 
a second layer of risk management is the structure of the reinsurance contracts 
all variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts include some form of annual or aggregate claim limit s 
the exact limits vary by contract but some examples of typical contract provisions include annual claim limits  as a percentage of reinsured account or guaranteed value  for guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb and gmibs annual annuitization rate limits  as a percentage of annuitization eligible account or guaranteed value  for gmibs a third layer of risk management is the hedging strategy which is focused on mitigating long term economic losses at a portfolio level 
as of december  and  ace tempest life re owned financial market instruments as part of the hedging strategy with a fair value of million  and million  respectively 
the instruments are substantially collateralized by our counterparty  on a daily basis 
we also limit the aggregate amount of variable annuity reinsurance guarantee risk we are willing to assume 
the last substantive us transaction was quoted in mid and the last transaction in japan was quoted in late ace tempest life re did not quote on new or renewal variable annuity transactions in and the aggregate number of policyholders is currently decreasing through policyholder withdrawals and deaths at a rate of annually 

table of contents note that gmib claims cannot occur for any reinsured policy until it has reached the end of its waiting period 
the vast majority of policies we reinsure reach the end of their waiting periods in or later  as shown in the table below

death benefits gmdb premiums and claims from variable annuity contracts reinsuring gmdbs 
approximately percent of our gmdb guaranteed value has an annual claim limit expressed as two percent of the total account value reinsured 
this limit falls as account values fall in a declining market 
using our current mortality assumptions we expect approximately million of claims and million of premium on death benefits during living benefits includes gmib and gmab premiums and claims from variable annuity contracts reinsuring predominantly gmibs and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  collectively known as living benefits 
substantially all of our living benefit reinsurance clients policyholders are currently ineligible to trigger a claim payment 
these policyholders begin to become eligible in using our current mortality assumptions we expect approximately million of claims and million of premium on living benefits during

ace tempest life re maintains sufficient qualified assets to meet its funding requirements 
goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  was billion at december  the ace ina and combined insurance acquisitions represent approximately percent of this balance 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to a periodic evaluation for impairment at least annually  or earlier if there are any indications of possible impairment 
the impairment tests in  in the aggregate  show a fair value in excess of the carrying value 
goodwill is assigned to applicable reporting units of acquired entities at acquisition 
the most significant reporting units are the north american and international divisions of combined insurance acquired in  domestic and international divisions of ace ina acquired in  ace tempest re s catastrophe businesses acquired in and  and tarquin limited acquired in there are other reporting units that resulted from smaller acquisitions that are also assessed annually 
in our impairment tests  to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit  we consistently applied a combination of the following models an earnings multiple  a book value multiple  a discounted cash flow or an allocated market capitalization 
the earnings and book value models apply multiples of comparable publicly traded companies to forecasted earnings or book value of each reporting unit and consider current market transactions 
the discounted cash flow model applies a discount to estimated cash flows including a terminal value calculation 
the market capitalization model allocates our market capitalization to each reporting unit 
we must assess whether the current fair value of our operating units is at least equal to the fair value used in the determination of goodwill 
in doing this  we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our operating segments  as this is important in assessing whether impairment has occurred 
if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities change  goodwill could be materially adjusted 
this would cause us to write down the carrying value of goodwill and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the charge is taken 
fair value measurements we partially adopted the provisions of financial accounting standard no 
 fair value measurements fas on january  fas defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and establishes a three level valuation hierarchy in which inputs into valuation techniques used to measure fair value are classified 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data 
inputs in level are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level includes inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include  among other items  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates and yield curves 
level inputs are unobservable and reflect our judgments about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
while the company obtains values for the majority of the investment securities it holds from one or more pricing services  it is ultimately management s responsibility to determine whether the values obtained and recorded in the financial statements are representative of fair value 
we periodically update our understanding of the methodologies used by our pricing services in order to validate that the prices obtained from those services are consistent with fas valuation principles 
based on our understanding of the methodologies used by our pricing services  all investments have been valued in accordance with fas we do not typically adjust prices obtained from pricing services 
volatility and widening credit spreads during the second half of adversely affected the values of certain of our securities 
however  we believe there was sufficient market activity to price securities under fas in a manner consistent with prior periods 
at december   our level assets represented approximately five percent of our assets that are measured at fair value and three percent of our total assets 
at december   our level liabilities represented approximately percent of our liabilities that are measured at fair value and less than two percent of our total liabilities 
during  we transferred million out of level the following is a description of the valuation measurements used for our financial instruments levels   and carried or disclosed at fair value  as well as the general classification of such financial instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy 

table of contents fixed maturities with active markets such as us treasury and agency securities are classified within level as fair values are based on quoted market prices 
for fixed maturities that trade in less active markets  including corporate and municipal securities  fair values are based on the output of pricing matrix models  the significant inputs into which include  but are not limited to  yield curves  credit risks and spreads  measures of volatility  and prepayment speeds 
these fixed maturities are classified within level our pricing methodologies incorporate back testing of valuation techniques as a standard part of our process 
fixed maturities for which pricing is unobservable are classified within level equity securities with active markets are classified within level as fair values are based on quoted market prices 
for non public equity securities  fair values are based on market valuations and are classified within level short term investments  which comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of purchase that are traded in active markets  are classified within level as fair values are based on quoted market prices 
securities such as commercial paper and discount notes are classified within level because these securities are typically not actively traded due to their approaching maturity and  as such  their cost approximating par value 
fair values for other investments  principally other direct equity investments  investment funds  and limited partnerships  are based on the net asset value or financial statements and are included within level equity securities and fixed maturities held in rabbi trusts maintained by ace for deferred compensation plans  and included in other investments  are classified within the valuation hierarchy on the same basis as our other equity securities and fixed maturities 
the fair value of our investment in assured guaranty ltd 
included in investments in partially owned insurance companies is based on a quoted market price and is classified within level fair values for investments in partially owned insurance companies based on the financial statements provided by those companies used for equity accounting are classified within level for actively traded investment derivative instruments  including futures  options  and exchange traded forward contracts  we obtain quoted market prices to determine fair value 
as such  these instruments are included within level forward contracts that are not exchange traded are priced using a pricing matrix model principally employing observable inputs and  as such  are classified within level our position in interest rate and credit default swaps is typically classified within level for gmib reinsurance  we estimate fair value using an internal valuation model which includes current market information and estimates of policyholder behavior 
all of our treaties contain claim limits  which are factored into the valuation model 
the cumulative effect of partially adopting fas resulted in a reduction to retained earnings of million related to an increase in risk margins included in the valuation of certain gmib contracts 
the fair value depends on a number of inputs  including changes in interest rates  changes in equity markets  credit risk  current account value  changes in market volatility  expected annuitization rates  changes in policyholder behavior  and changes in policyholder mortality 
the model and related assumptions are continuously re evaluated by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based upon additional experience obtained related to policyholder behavior and availability of more timely information  such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities 
the most significant policyholder behavior assumptions include lapse rates and annuitization rates using the guaranteed benefit gmib annuitization rate 
assumptions regarding lapse rates and gmib annuitization rates differ by treaty but the underlying methodology to determine rates applied to each treaty is comparable 
the assumptions regarding lapse and gmib annuitization rates determined for each treaty are based on a dynamic calculation that uses several underlying factors 
a lapse rate is the percentage of in force policies surrendered in a given calendar year 
all else equal  as lapse rates increase  ultimate claim payments will decrease 
the gmib annuitization rate is the percentage of policies for which the customer will elect to annuitize using the guaranteed benefit provided under the gmib 
all else equal  as gmib annuitization rates increase  ultimate claim payments will increase  subject to treaty claim limits 
the effect of changes in key market factors on assumed lapse and annuitization rates reflect emerging trends using actual data available from cedants 
for treaties with limited experience  rates are established in line with data received from other ceding companies adjusted as appropriate with industry estimates 
we view our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance  with the probability of a cumulative long term economic net loss relatively small 
however  adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an adverse impact on both our life underwriting income and our net income  which may be material 
because of the significant use of unobservable inputs including policyholder behavior  gmib reinsurance is classified within level refer to critical accounting estimates guaranteed minimum income benefits derivatives and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk reinsurance of gmib and gmdb guarantees 
we maintain positions in other derivative instruments including option contracts designed to limit long term exposure to a severe equity market decline or decrease in interest rates  which would cause an increase in expected claims and  therefore  reserves for gmdb and gmib reinsurance business 
the fair value of the majority of our positions in other derivative instruments is based on significant observable inputs including equity security and interest rate indices 
accordingly  these are classified within level 
table of contents where practical  fair values for short term debt  long term debt  and trust preferred securities are estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based principally on observable inputs including our incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued

ace private risk services added million to our net premiums earned 
during  our a h business continued to report growth while our casualty lines  particularly in north america  declined 
the increase in net premiums earned in  compared with  was primarily related to increased production at ace usa and ace international as well as our life operations  partially offset by decreased production at our global reinsurance segment 
net investment income increased over the last three years  primarily due to investment of positive operating cash flows which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base 
refer to net investment income and investments 
in evaluating our segments excluding life insurance and reinsurance  we use the combined ratio  the loss and loss expense ratio  the policy acquisition cost ratio  and the administrative expense ratio 
we calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned 
we do not calculate these ratios for the life insurance and reinsurance segment as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that segment 
the combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio  the policy acquisition cost ratio  and the administrative expense ratio 
a combined ratio under percent indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio exceeding percent indicates underwriting losses

this information is based on currently available information derived from industry assessments of exposure and claims information obtained from our clients and brokers

we experienced million of net favorable prior period development in this compares with million of net favorable prior period development in  and million of net favorable prior period development in the favorable prior period development in was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements  refer to prior period development 
overall  the loss and loss expense ratio  adjusted  has increased over the prior year  due to competitive market conditions  partially offset by the favorable impact of the increasing mix of a h business  which experiences lower loss ratios relative to p c business 
our policy acquisition costs include commissions  premium taxes  underwriting  and other costs that vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of premium 
administrative expenses include all other operating costs 
our policy acquisition cost ratio increased significantly in  compared with  primarily due to the growth in a h business  including the combined insurance business  which is predominantly a h 
a h business typically requires higher commission rates than traditional p c business 
for  the increase in policy acquisition costs also included the impact of higher acquisition costs on ace westchester s crop hail business  reflecting more profitable crop hail results on final settlement of written policies 
this generated a higher profit share commission which added approximately percentage points to our policy acquisition cost ratio 
additionally  for  we experienced higher costs due to the inclusion of ace private risk services unit which typically generates a higher policy acquisition cost ratio than our commercial p c business 
our administrative expenses increased in  primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance and ace private risk services 
for  our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable  compared with  as the increasing trend experienced due to the growth of a h was offset by reduced ceding commission at ace tempest re usa 
our administrative expense ratio decreased in  compared with  due to the increase in net premiums 
table of contents earned 
administrative expenses in include million related to the settlement with certain governmental agencies from their investigations of various insurance industry practices 
our effective income tax rate  which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax  is dependent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates 
a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate 
our effective tax rate on net income was percent in  compared with percent in and for  our effective tax rate was adversely impacted by large realized losses on investments and derivatives and also due to a higher proportion of our net income being generated in higher tax paying jurisdictions 
we decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million in due primarily to a change in tax regulation 
prior period development the favorable prior period development of million on net unpaid losses and loss expenses during the year ended december   was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements 
in the sections following the table below  significant prior period movements within each reporting segment by claim tail attribute are discussed in more detail

insurance north american insurance north american incurred net favorable prior period development of million in  representing percent of the segment s net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at december  the net prior period development in was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements  driven by the following principal changes net favorable development of million on long tail business  including adverse development of million in our national accounts workers compensation portfolios comprised two items of significance 
first  favorable development of million arising on accident year  due to the absence of multi claimant events such as industrial accidents 
the majority of our exposure for these perils falls under our national accounts high deductible and excess product lines 
we evaluate this exposure on an annual basis  after the accident year has closed  allowing for the late reporting or identification of significant losses and for an initial assessment of the accident year 
our review in of potential events  coupled with our initial assessment of the accident year has led to a decrease in our estimate of the required provision for these claims 
second  adverse development of million relating to and prior accident years 
this development was the direct result of reported loss activity greater than expected in our prior review 
during the past year  a targeted open case reserve review was conducted by our claims staff which resulted in a number of material case reserve increases that were not anticipated in our prior estimates of ultimate loss  favorable development of million in our national accounts commercial auto and general liability product lines comprised two items of significance 
first  favorable development of million was mainly from accident years 
table of contents and prior for exposures written on an excess basis 
the combination of continued lower than expected reported incurred loss activity for the accident years as well as increased weighting on loss development reserving methods  as these years mature  has driven the majority of the improvement in projected ultimate losses 
second  favorable development of million relating to the accident years primarily on a block of runoff programs comprising general liability  auto liability  and workers compensation product coverages 
this favorable development was a result of lower than expected paid and case incurred development observed in the most recent reserve review which resulted in lower selected ultimate loss projections  adverse development of million related to higher than expected loss and allocated loss adjustment expense activity on reported claims in our small and middle market guaranteed cost workers compensation portfolios  primarily affecting the and accident years 
recent case activity on these portfolios through calendar year and into was higher than expectations and we adjusted our estimates of ultimate loss accordingly 
prior estimates relied heavily on industry benchmarks including average severity trends  adverse development of million on a portfolio of primary casualty business written by ace westchester impacting the accident years 
this adverse activity was a function of higher than expected loss and allocated expenses on business that has a heavy concentration of exposure to commercial contractors 
in the past few quarters  both paid and incurred development patterns for the tail period beyond months have developed worse than industry benchmark factors which formed the basis for our projections in prior analyses  favorable development of million on excess casualty and umbrella business in our ace westchester unit primarily impacting accident years this favorable activity was a function of a shift in weighting from expected loss based reserving methods to direct projections of ultimate losses as this long tailed exposure begins to mature for these accident periods  adverse development of million on an ace bermuda professional lines claim in accident year as a result of a review in  that identified significant erosion below our attachment  adverse development of million on our portfolio of defense base acts workers compensation coverage covers employees of us government contractors overseas 
we experienced higher than expected incurred loss development since the last reserve study concentrated in the and accident years 
the majority of the development was related to increases in case reserves on known claims for these accident years  and recorded in these increases were judged to be more than claim acceleration and resulted in significant increases in the and accident year ultimate loss projections given the immaturity of the impacted accident years and long tail nature of the portfolio  favorable development of million on our medical risk business  primarily our hospital professional liability portfolio for the and accident years 
coverage is provided on a claims made basis and both paid and case incurred loss activity since our last review have been favorable relative to expected 
as these accident periods have matured  we have gradually increased the weight applied to experience based methods  including the bornhuetter ferguson method  and placing less weight on our initial expected loss ratio method  favorable development of million in our management and professional liability product lines 
this development was the net result of favorable development totaling million associated with the and prior accident years and adverse development of million with respect to the accident year 
the favorable prior period development was a function of a review of all open claims in our retail management liability operation and a reassessment of the potential ultimate exposure on these claims 
this reassessment of exposure and the maturation of these accident periods supported increasing the weight given to experience based loss projections 
the adverse development relating to the accident year is due solely to a claim by claim review of exposures impacted by the ongoing credit crisis including but not limited to sub prime mortgages 
these claim file reviews occurred during the calendar year as facts and circumstances surrounding these exposures continued to emerge and develop  favorable development of million on our long tail exposures in our canadian p c operations  principally arising in the accident year on excess casualty  umbrella  and d o product lines 
actual paid and case incurred loss activity has been lower than expected since our prior analysis 
in addition  we have increased the weighting given to experience based methods from the initial expected loss ratio method as these accident years mature  favorable development of million for accident years due to the expiration of a large  multi year insurance contract written in our ace financial solutions business unit 
this contract included a significant per occurrence limit excess of a high attachment point 
coverage was provided on an integrated occurrence basis requiring notice of an event during the policy period 
we completed a detailed claims audit in the fourth quarter of which led to an adjustment to the booked loss and loss expense reserves  
table of contents adverse development of million on runoff casualty reserves  including asbestos and environmental  in the brandywine and ace westchester business units following completion of our internal ground up review of asbestos and environmental liabilities for the most significant policyholders identified to date 
this adverse development arose from several sources  the principal one of which was as a result of increased defense costs in litigating traditional tort defenses on asbestos cases  and favorable development of million relating to the completion of account reconciliations that identified duplicate loss processing  over processed coinsurance  and unregistered reinsurance recoveries 
net favorable development of million on short tail business  including favorable development of million on ace westchester crop hail business relating to the recording of the crop year bordereau received in  adverse development totaling million relating to increases in our estimates of losses for the hurricanes primarily in ace westchester property million and ace financial services international ace fsi million 
the ace westchester development was due primarily to settlement on several excess policies above our prior case reserves  resulting in higher estimates of ultimate loss 
the claims handling associated with the hurricanes involved complex and unique causation and coverage issues 
these issues continue to be present and may have a further adverse impact on our financial results  which may be material 
the ace fsi development was due to adverse development on a retrocessional program following a review of the program s claim circumstances  favorable development of million relating to lower than expected paid claims for the accident year on a run off portfolio of warranty business  mostly automobile extended warranty contracts 
the change was driven primarily by recognition of recent paid claim experience  as a percentage of earned premiums  which has been lower than the historical averages used in our prior analyses  favorable development of million on ace westchester property and inland marine businesses 
this change was due primarily to the fact that the reported incurred and paid loss activity for the accident year non catastrophe losses proved lower than anticipated based on historical loss development patterns  favorable settlements of million on ace bermuda property claims mainly in accident years as a result of favorable claims experience 
a review of all open claims was performed in the fourth quarter of  which concluded that actual experience to date had been more favorable than the assumptions used to establish the reserves for the open claims  favorable development of million mainly in accident years and for ace bermuda political risk 
this line is subject to review twice a year  during the fourth quarter review  we reflected the limited paid and case incurred loss activity relative to our assumptions and known events by releasing million of ibnr  favorable development of million on ace usa s property business  primarily associated with the accident year and a portfolio of diverse global exposures written on an excess basis 
reported loss activity during the year  has been lower than anticipated in our prior review  favorable development of million in our canadian p c operations short tail lines concentrated in the and accident years  covering multiple product lines including property and auto physical damage 
reported loss activity on these product lines was lower than expected  favorable development of million on the ace usa commercial marine product lines primarily with respect to the accident years 
the favorable development was concentrated in the marine hull product line where loss development and or emergence during the calendar year were lower than expected  and favorable development of million on the ace usa recreational marine business primarily associated with the accident year 
loss emergence and or development during the calendar year were lower than historical averages used in our prior projections 
insurance north american incurred net adverse prior period development of million in  representing percent of the segment s net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at december  the net prior period development in was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements  driven by the following principal changes net favorable development of million on long tail business including adverse development of million due to an adjustment made in relating to ibnr reserves on commuted ceded reinsurance contracts  identified and resolved during  adverse development of million on two related specialty claims from a runoff financial guaranty program affecting accident year due to adverse judicial rulings rendered during the calendar year  adverse development on our estimates of future allocated claims expense on two separate portfolios of workers compensation insurance totaling million 
this change in estimate affected our national accounts workers compensation 
table of contents business principally accident years and a runoff portfolio of workers compensation servicing carrier business covering accident years and prior 
for the national accounts business  the change was principally in our high deductible portfolio 
based on analyses completed during  we have increased our tail factor for allocated loss adjustment expenses alae as well as our ratios of alae to loss used in our projection methodologies 
small movements in these assumptions produce a leveraged increase in the loss estimates across a number of accident years  adverse development on our estimates of ultimate loss on a collection of runoff professional liability and medical programs totaling million 
this adverse development was the direct result of a review of all open claims that was completed during this claims review identified a number of cases where adverse change in facts and circumstances led to a significant deviation from our estimates of ultimate claim value  favorable development of million in our workers compensation business due to the absence of multi claimant events such as industrial accidents for the accident year 
the majority of our exposure for these perils falls under our national accounts high deductible line of business 
we evaluate this exposure annually after the accident year has closed allowing for the late identification of significant losses 
our review in of potential accident year losses has led to a decrease in our estimate of the required provision for these claims  favorable development in our estimate of ultimate loss and alae of million in our surety business 
this improvement was heavily concentrated in the and accident years 
in the calendar year  the level of late reported claims and development on known claims for this portfolio was significantly below historical levels for this line of business resulting in a reduction in all loss projection methods  favorable development on our national accounts casualty business  primarily general liability  of million for the accident years 
development on these portfolios had been favorable relative to the original assumptions used to price the products 
actual paid and incurred loss activity in was lower than assumed in our prior projections and we have modified our estimates accordingly  and favorable development of million on our foreign casualty portfolio for the and prior accident years 
this was partly due to an adjustment for a reserve established in for a single large claim  but also due to low levels of reported and paid loss activity on our foreign captive business 
this particular line has net exposure on a per occurrence basis excess of high deductibles self insured retentions and an aggregate basis excess of an aggregate attachment point 
expected loss emergence patterns used in our review projected higher loss development for the and prior accident years than emerged during prompting a reduction in our projection of ultimate losses 
net adverse development of million on short tail business including adverse development totaling million relating to increases in our estimates of loss for the storms primarily in our ace westchester operation but also some modest development in our offshore energy business 
this development was due primarily to a relatively small number of losses on excess policies with large exposed limits 
these losses reached settlement during for amounts in excess of our case reserves prompting adjustments to our projections of ultimate losses 
the claims handling associated with the hurricanes had involved complex and unique causation and coverage issues 
these issues were present in  favorable development of million on ace westchester crop hail business 
this was the direct effect of recording the final settlement of the pool year from the bordereau received during the calendar year  favorable development in our estimates of ultimate losses for first party lines including property and auto physical damage in our ace canada operations totaling million  affecting primarily the accident year 
incurred loss development during calendar year on the accident year was lower than historical averages which formed the basis for our prior projections 
given the relatively short reporting pattern for this business  the actual loss emergence was assigned greater credibility and the ultimate loss estimates revised accordingly  favorable development in our estimates of ultimate loss of million on our canadian a h portfolio 
we have limited historical experience for this product line 
losses were originally recorded using an expected loss ratio method 
actual loss emergence in calendar year has proven to be more favorable than our prior projections 
given the relatively short reporting pattern for this business  the actual loss emergence was assigned credibility and the ultimate loss estimates revised accordingly  and favorable development in our estimates of ultimate loss of million on short tail  non catastrophe losses in our ace westchester property and inland marine product lines 
attritional incurred loss activity on the and accident years in the calendar year was lower than historical averages which formed the basis for our prior projections

most of the reduction was in accident years on financial lines  primary casualty  and supported casualty excess 
additional excess releases were made in accident years and prior

in addition  we have increased the weighting given to experience based methods from the initial expected loss ratio method as these accident periods mature  favorable development of million in ace global market financial lines 
this was across a number of accident years

the favorable development during the past year was due in large part to shifting credibility away from bornhuetter ferguson methods and relying more heavily on loss development patterns as case incurred loss became a more accurate predictor of ultimate loss 
this shift in credibility tended to reduce indicated ultimate losses since  with hindsight  our initial expected loss ratios have proven to be conservative  favorable development of million on hurricane losses in ace global markets

the increase in the loss and loss expense ratio as adjusted in  compared with  was primarily due to changes in business mix  specifically higher premiums from the crop business  which carries a relatively high current accident year loss ratio 
in addition  the loss and loss expense ratio reflects increased loss costs  including higher incurred losses for non catastrophe events that affected the property  marine and energy business units 
insurance north american s policy acquisition cost ratio increased in  compared with  due in part to the inclusion of ace private risk services in  which generates a higher acquisition cost ratio than our commercial p c business

in addition  higher assumed loss portfolio transfer business in  which incurred low acquisition costs as is typical for these types of transactions  reduced the policy acquisition ratio by percentage points 
these increases in the policy acquisition cost ratio were partially offset by improvements at ace bermuda  primarily due to increased ceding commissions 
the decrease in insurance north american s policy acquisition cost ratio  compared with  was primarily related to reductions in the policy acquisition cost ratio at ace usa and ace westchester 
for ace usa  the reduction reflected higher ceding commissions as well as lower premium taxes due to reassessment of obligations for premium based assessments and guaranty funds

net investment income includes accretion from the new cost basis of securities for which other than temporary impairments have been recorded due to interest rate spreads 
accretion does not occur for securities where an other than temporary impairment was attributable to issuer specific credit events 
net investment income increased eight percent in  compared with  and percent in  compared with the increase in net investment income is primarily due to several years of positive operating cash flows which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base

the following table shows the return on average invested assets for the years ended december    and in millions of us dollars average invested assets net investment income return on average invested assets net realized and unrealized gains losses we take a long term view with our investment strategy and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines designed to minimize risk 
the majority of our investment portfolio is available for sale and reported at fair value 
our held to maturity investment portfolio is reported at amortized cost 
the effect of market movements on our available for sale investment portfolio impacts net income through net realized gains losses when securities are sold or when other than temporary impairments are recorded 
additionally  net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of derivatives  including financial futures  options  swaps  and gmib reinsurance 
changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities  which result from the revaluation of securities held  are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
subject to investment guidelines approved by our finance and investment committee of the board of directors relating to asset classes  credit quality  and liquidity  our investment managers generally have the ability to sell securities from our available for sale investment portfolio with the concurrence of ace management when they determine that an alternative security with comparable risks is likely to provide a higher investment return  considering the realized gain or loss on sale of the held security and differential in future investment income 
often  sales of individual securities occur when investment managers conclude there are changes in the credit quality of a particular security or  for other reasons  market value is apt to deteriorate 
further  we may sell securities when we conclude it is prudent to reduce a concentration in a particular issuer or industry 
therefore  securities sales volume may increase in a volatile credit market in which credit spreads and  thus  the market value of fixed maturity investments are subject to significant changes in a short period of time 
the interest rate environment will tend to have a limited effect on securities sales volume but extreme conditions could have an effect on the magnitude of realized gains or losses 
for example  in a declining interest rate environment  the market value of securities increases  resulting in a greater likelihood of net realized gains and we would  therefore  tend to reduce the average duration of our fixed maturity investment portfolio 
an environment where interest rates are increasing would tend to have the opposite effect 
the effect of a high level of realized losses or gains for a particular period will tend to be offset by increases or decreases in investment income  respectively  in subsequent periods 
from a liquidity perspective  there is a risk is that we could be forced to sell a large volume of securities at a loss ie  in a high interest rate environment to meet operating needs and are  thus  unable to reinvest proceeds to recoup such losses with future investment income refer to liquidity and capital resources for more information 
we review our investments for other than temporary impairment based on the following the amount of time a security has been in a loss position  the magnitude of the loss position  and whether the security is rated below an investment grade level  the period in which cost is expected to be recovered  if at all  based on various criteria including economic conditions  credit loss experience  and other issuer specific developments  
table of contents our ability and intent to hold the security to the expected recovery period  and equity securities in an unrealized loss position for twelve consecutive months were generally impaired 
given current market conditions  and in light of recent general guidance from the sec and the fasb regarding the application of existing guidance during stressed market conditions  beginning in the third quarter of we have qualitatively evaluated our application of the parameters under which we consider a decline in value to be other than temporary 
similar to prior quarters  we evaluated investments in our portfolio where cost exceeded fair value and made certain judgments as to our ability to recover our cost 
our analysis  beginning with the third quarter of  required us to consider carefully the duration and severity of decline and the root causes thereof 
specifically  we further evaluated during the quarter whether declines were related to temporary liquidity concerns and current market conditions  and therefore more likely to be temporary  or were instead related to specific credit events or issuer performance  and therefore more likely to be other than temporarily impaired 
using this refined evaluation process resulted in a lower dollar value of investments in an unrealized loss position being deemed other than temporarily impaired in comparison to our previous evaluation process 
we believe the underlying credit quality of the portfolio supports the use of our modified approach 
refer to note e to the consolidated financial statements  under item  which includes a table that summarizes all of our securities in an unrealized loss position at december  when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment  we record a write down to estimated fair value  which reduces the cost basis 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
for fixed maturity investments  the discount or reduced premium based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment income  and included in income in future periods based upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows of the security

other net realized gains losses principally includes gains and losses from security sales 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities in were concentrated in the financial services sector of our corporate securities and were primarily driven by downgrades in credit  bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities in included approximately million related to the filing of a chapter bankruptcy petition by lehman brothers 
other than temporary impairments of equity securities in of million were driven by overall declines in the equity markets 
other than temporary impairments in and were million and million for fixed maturities  million and million for equities and million and million for other investments and were primarily due to an increase in market interest rates from the date of security purchase 
our net realized and unrealized loss in included approximately billion of decline in our investment grade fixed income portfolio and approximately million on our high yield bond portfolio 
as of december   our us investment portfolios held by us legal entities included approximately billion of gross unrealized losses on fixed income investments and million of realized losses for impairments of fixed income investments related to temporary liquidity concerns and current market conditions 
our tax planning strategy related to these losses is based on our view that we will hold our fixed income investments until they recover their cost 
as such  we have recognized a deferred tax asset of approximately million related to these fixed income investments 
this strategy allows us to fully recognize the associated deferred tax asset as we do not believe these losses will ever be realized  and accordingly  we did not record a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset 
we engage in a securities lending program  which involves lending investments to other institutions for short periods of time 
ace invests the collateral received in short term funds of high credit quality with the objective of maintaining a stable principal balance 
during  certain investments in the money market mutual funds purchased with the securities lending collateral declined in value resulting in a million unrealized loss 
the unrealized loss is attributable to fluctuations in market values of the underlying performing debt instruments held by the respective mutual funds  rather than default of a debt issuer 
we concluded that the decline in value was temporary

the portfolio is externally managed by independent  professional investment managers 
the average duration of our fixed income securities  including the effect of options and swaps  was years at december   compared with years at december  we estimate that a basis point bps increase in interest rates would reduce our book value by approximately billion at december  for the year ended december   we experienced net unrealized losses of approximately billion  primarily due to widening of credit spreads 
we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until they recover their cost 
other investments principally comprises direct investments  investment funds  and limited partnerships 
our exposure to sub prime asset backed securities was million at december   which represented less than one percent of our investment portfolio 
we do not expect any material investment loss from our exposure to sub prime mortgages 
our investment portfolio continues to be predominantly invested in investment grade fixed income securities and is broadly diversified across geographies  sectors and issuers 
our aggregate investment exposure to lehman brothers and american international group has been and is a small percentage of our investment portfolio 
we hold no collateralized debt obligations or collateralized loan obligations in our investment portfolio

table of contents below investment grade corporate fixed income portfolio in accordance with our investment process  we invest in below investment grade securities through investment portfolios managed by external investment managers that have investment professionals specifically dedicated to this asset class 
at december   our fixed income investment portfolio included below investment grade and non rated securities which  in total  comprised approximately five percent of our fixed income portfolio 
we define a security as being below investment grade if it has an s p credit rating of bb or less 
our below investment grade and non rated portfolio includes approximately issuers  with the greatest single exposure being million 
below investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities 
risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below investment grade securities 
below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer 
also  issuers of below investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  such as recession or increasing interest rates  than are investment grade issuers 
ace manages high yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds 
ace s allocation to high yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality bb b 
our minimum rating for initial purchase is bb b 
four external investment managers are responsible for high yield security selection and portfolio construction

table of contents reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance the composition of our reinsurance recoverable at december  and  is as follows in millions of us dollars reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses provision for uncollectible reinsurance on unpaid losses and loss expenses reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses  net of a provision for uncollectible reinsurance reinsurance recoverable on paid losses and loss expenses provision for uncollectible reinsurance on paid losses and loss expenses net reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable on future policy benefits we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and potential reinsurers on a regular basis and also monitor concentrations of credit risk with reinsurers 
the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the failure of reinsurers to indemnify us  primarily because of disputes under reinsurance contracts and insolvencies 
the decrease in reinsurance recoverable was due to a number of factors  the largest contributors are the decline due to foreign exchange revaluation of million  collections on run off business of approximately million  a decrease in gross and ceded ibnr on run off business as a result of a reserve review of million offset by an increase of approximately million of catastrophe losses ceded  primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike 
the acquisition of combined insurance added million to our reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses and million to our reinsurance recoverable on future policy benefits at the date of acquisition 
asbestos and environmental and other run off liabilities included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for a e 
these a e liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites 
the estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal  social  and economic environment 
we have not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our a e reserves  which include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims 
our exposure to a e claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased westchester specialty in and the p c business of cigna in  with the larger exposure contained within the liabilities acquired in the cigna transaction 
in  prior to our acquisition of the p c business of cigna  the pennsylvania insurance commissioner approved a plan to restructure ina financial corporation and its subsidiaries the restructuring which included the division of insurance company of north america ina into two separate corporations an active insurance company that retained the ina name and continued to write p c business and an inactive run off company  now called century indemnity company century 
as a result of the division  predominantly all a e and certain other liabilities of ina were allocated to century and extinguished  as a matter of pennsylvania law  as liabilities of ina 
as part of the restructuring  most a e liabilities of various us affiliates of ina were reinsured to century  and century and certain other run off companies having a e and other liabilities were contributed to brandywine holdings 
as part of the acquisition of the p c business of cigna  we acquired brandywine holdings and its various subsidiaries 
for more information refer to brandywine run off entities below 
during  we conducted an internal  ground up review of our consolidated a e liabilities as of december  during the same period  a team of external actuaries performed an evaluation as to the adequacy of the reserves of century 
this external review was conducted in accordance with the brandywine restructuring order  which requires that an independent actuarial review of century s reserves be completed every two years 
management takes full responsibility for the estimation of its a e liabilities 
as a result of our internal review  we increased our net loss reserves for the brandywine operations  including a e  by million net of reinsurance provided by nico  while the gross loss reserves increased by million 
the conclusions of the external review provided estimates of ultimate net brandywine liabilities that are little changed from a comparable study in we also decreased our net loss reserves for westchester specialty s a e and other liabilities by million net of nico  while the gross loss reserves decreased by million 
our a e reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated future changes in the legal  social or economic environment  or any benefit from future legislative reforms

at december   net environmental reserves are higher than gross environmental reserves because they include the provision for uncollectible paid reinsurance recoverables 
the a e net loss reserves including allocated and unallocated loss expense reserves and provision for uncollectible reinsurance at december   of billion shown in the above table are comprised of billion in reserves held by brandywine run off companies  million of reserves held by westchester specialty  million of reserves held by ace bermuda and million of reserves held by insurance overseas general 
the net figures in the above table reflect third party reinsurance other than reinsurance provided by nico under three aggregate excess of loss contracts described below collectively  the nico contracts 
we exclude the nico contracts as they cover non a e liabilities as well as a e liabilities 
the split of coverage provided under the nico contracts for a e liabilities as compared to non a e liabilities is entirely dependant on the timing of the payment of the related claims 
our ability to make an estimate of this split is not practicable 
we believe  instead  that the a e discussion is best provided excluding the nico contracts  while separately discussing the nico contracts in relation to the total subject business  both a e and non a e  covered by those contracts 
with certain exceptions  the nico contracts provide coverage for our net a e incurred losses and allocated loss expenses within the limits of coverage and above ace s retention levels 
these exceptions include losses arising from certain operations of insurance overseas general and participations by ace bermuda as a co reinsurer or retrocessionaire in the nico contracts 
brandywine run off impact of nico contracts on ace s run off liabilities as part of the acquisition of cigna s p c business  nico provided billion of reinsurance protection to century on all brandywine loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves and on the a e reserves of various ace ina insurance subsidiaries reinsured by century in each case  including uncollectible reinsurance

the a e and other balances were increased by million and million  respectively  at december   to more properly reflect unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves as part of brandywine 
the other reserve balance at december   was further increased by million to reflect final activity on the fourth quarter nico bordereau 
as a result of these adjustments  the total a e and other balances at december   have been increased by million 
the balance at december   has been increased by million to reflect final activity on the fourth quarter nico bordereau 

table of contents the incurred activity was primarily related to our internal review of our consolidated a e liabilities resulting in an increase to our net loss reserves for the brandywine operations  including a e  by million  while the gross loss reserves increased by million

at december   the remaining unused incurred limit under the nico agreement was million  which is only available for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the increase in the remaining unused limit was primarily in connection with recording the results of our internal reserve review

reserving considerations for asbestos  we face claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers  distributors  installers  and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos 
claims can be filed by individual claimants or groups of claimants with the potential for hundreds of individual claimants at one time 
claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies for a single insured 
environmental claims present exposure for remediation and defense costs associated with the contamination of property as a result of pollution 
it is common  especially for larger defendants  to be named as a potentially responsible party prp at multiple sites 
our environmental claim count definition is based on policyholder by site numbers 
for example  if a policyholder were named as a prp at ten pollution sites  we would track this as ten claim counts 
in addition  should we have multiple policyholders identified as prp s at the same waste site  each would constitute a separate claim count 
the table below summarizes count information for asbestos and environmental claims for the years ended december  and  for direct policies only  and excludes claims from assumed reinsurance 
asbestos by causative agent open at the beginning of year newly reported closed or otherwise disposed open at end of year environmental by site open at the beginning of year newly reported closed or otherwise disposed open at end of year 
table of contents closed or otherwise disposed claims were significantly higher in  compared with  following a review in of inactive files that revealed that payment was no longer sought on the files  therefore  the files were closed 
the following table shows our gross and net survival ratios for our a e loss reserves and alae reserves at december  and survival ratios survival ratios year year year year gross net gross net gross net gross net asbestos environmental total the net ratios reflect third party reinsurance other than the aggregate excess reinsurance provided under the nico contracts 
these survival ratios are calculated by dividing the asbestos or environmental loss and alae reserves by the average asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments for the three most recent calendar years year survival ratio  and by asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments in year survival ratio 
the survival ratios provide only a very rough depiction of reserves  and are significantly impacted by a number of factors such as aggressive settlement practices  variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims and levels of coverage provided 
we  therefore  urge caution in using these very simplistic ratios to gauge reserve adequacy and note that the year survival ratios  particularly  are likely to move considerably from year to year for the reasons just described 
the year gross survival ratios for both asbestos and environmental decreased markedly from due to a number of large settlements in this has resulted in a decline in the three year gross ratios as well  though to a lesser degree than seen in the year ratios 
the year net asbestos ratio of was abnormally high because of the relatively large ceded reinsurance associated with asbestos payments in brandywine run off entities in addition to housing a significant portion of our a e exposure  the brandywine operations include run off liabilities related to various insurance and reinsurance businesses 
the following companies comprise ace s brandywine operations century a pennsylvania insurer  century re a pennsylvania insurer  and century international reinsurance company ltd 
a bermuda insurer circ 
all of the brandywine companies are direct or indirect subsidiaries of brandywine holdings 
the us based ace ina companies assumed two contractual obligations in respect of the brandywine operations in connection with the restructuring a dividend retention fund obligation and a surplus maintenance obligation in the form of an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement 
ina financial corporation established and funded a dividend retention fund the dividend retention fund consisting of million plus investment earnings 
pursuant to an interpretation of the brandywine restructuring order  the full balance of the dividend retention fund was contributed to century as of december  under the restructuring order  while any obligation to maintain the dividend retention fund is in effect  to the extent dividends are paid by ina holdings corporation to its parent  ina financial corporation  and to the extent ina financial corporation then pays such dividends to ina corporation  a portion of those dividends must be withheld to replenish the principal of the dividend retention fund to million within five years 
in  and  no such dividends were paid and  therefore  no replenishment of the dividend retention fund occurred 
the dividend retention fund may not be terminated without prior written approval from the pennsylvania insurance commissioner 
in addition  an ace ina insurance subsidiary provided reinsurance coverage to century in the amount of million under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement the aggregate excess of loss agreement if the statutory capital and surplus of century falls below million or if century lacks liquid assets with which to pay claims as they become due  after giving effect to the contribution of the balance  if any  of the dividend retention fund 
effective december   ace ina holdings contributed million to century in exchange for a surplus note 
after giving effect to the contribution and issuance of the surplus note  the statutory surplus of century at december   was million and approximately million in statutory basis losses have been ceded to the aggregate excess of loss agreement on an inception to date basis 
century reports the amount ceded under the aggregate excess of loss agreement in accordance with statutory accounting principles  which differ from gaap by  among other things  allowing century to discount its liabilities  including certain asbestos related and environmental pollution liabilities 
the reduction in in statutory basis losses ceded to the aggregate excess of loss agreement resulted principally from the cession of certain reinsurance amounts associated with estimates of reinsurer bad debt  to affiliated ace companies  and from an increase in discount benefit 
for 
table of contents gaap reporting purposes  intercompany reinsurance recoverables related to the aggregate excess of loss agreement are eliminated upon consolidation 
to estimate ace s remaining claim exposure under the aggregate excess of loss agreement on a gaap basis  we adjust the statutory cession to exclude the discount embedded in statutory loss reserves and we adjust the statutory provision for uncollectible reinsurance to a gaap basis amount 
at december   approximately million in gaap basis losses were ceded under the aggregate excess of loss agreement  leaving a remaining limit of coverage under that agreement of approximately million 
at december   the remaining limit of coverage under the agreement was million 
the reduction in gaap basis losses ceded to the aggregate excess of loss agreement resulted principally from the previously mentioned cession of certain reinsurance bad debts to affiliated ace companies 
while we believe ace has no legal obligation to fund losses above the aggregate excess of loss agreement limit of coverage  ace s consolidated results would nevertheless continue to include any losses above the limit of coverage for so long as the brandywine companies remain consolidated subsidiaries of ace 
uncertainties relating to ace s ultimate brandywine exposure in addition to the dividend retention fund and aggregate excess of loss agreement commitments described above  certain ace entities are primarily liable for asbestos  environmental  and other exposures that they have reinsured to century 
accordingly  if century were to become insolvent and ace were to lose control of century  some or all of the recoverables due to these ace companies from century could become uncollectible  yet those ace entities would continue to be responsible to pay claims to their insureds or reinsureds 
as of december   the aggregate reinsurance balances ceded by the active ace companies to century were approximately billion 
at december   century s carried gross reserves including reserves ceded by the active ace companies to century were billion 
we believe the intercompany reinsurance recoverables  which relate to liabilities payable over many years ie  years or more  are not impaired at this time 
a substantial portion of the liabilities ceded to century by its affiliates have in turn been ceded by century to nico and  as of december   approximately billion of cover remains on a paid basis 
should century s loss reserves experience adverse development in the future and should century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation  the reinsurance recoverables due from century to its affiliates would be payable only after the payment in full of certain expenses and liabilities  including administrative expenses and direct policy liabilities 
thus  the intercompany reinsurance recoverables would be at risk to the extent of the shortage of assets remaining to pay these recoverables 
as of december   losses ceded by century to the active ace companies and other amounts owed to century by the active ace companies were approximately million in the aggregate 
catastrophe management we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe accumulation around the world 
our modeled annual aggregate in year return period us hurricane probable maximum loss  net of reinsurance is approximately billion  ie  according to the model there is a one percent chance that ace s losses incurred in any year from us hurricanes could be in excess of billion or nine percent of our total shareholders equity at december  
we estimate that at such hypothetical loss levels  aggregate industry losses would be approximately billion 
our modeled single occurrence in return period california earthquake probable maximum loss  net of reinsurance is approximately million  ie  according to the model there is a one percent chance that ace s losses incurred in any single california earthquake event could be in excess of million or approximately six percent our total shareholders equity at december  
we estimate that at such hypothetical loss levels  the industry losses would be approximately billion 
ace s modeled losses reflect our in force portfolio as of october  and reinsurance program as of january  the modeling estimates of both ace and industry loss levels are inherently uncertain owing to key assumptions 
first  while the use of third party catastrophe modeling packages to simulate potential hurricane and earthquake losses is prevalent within the insurance industry  the models are reliant upon significant meteorology  seismology  and engineering assumptions to estimate hurricane and earthquake losses 
in particular  modeled hurricane and earthquake events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential 
second  there is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models and the running of the modeling software 
third  we are reliant upon third party estimates of industry insured exposures and there is significant variation possible around the relationship between ace s loss and that of the industry following an event 
fourth  we assume that our reinsurance recoveries following an event are fully collectible 
these loss estimates do not represent ace s potential maximum exposures and it is highly likely that ace s actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates 

table of contents natural catastrophe reinsurance program ace s core catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary operations ie  excluding assumed reinsurance and consists of two separate towers 
first  for losses arising out of north america  our core traditional program renewed on january   and we have purchased reinsurance coverage with the first layer being million in excess of million in all risk coverage 
we also purchased a reinsurance treaty that provides million part of million in coverage for us property perils other than us wind in excess of million 
in addition  to complement our core program  we purchased million part of million in excess of million and approximately percent of million in excess of million 
each program noted above has a single reinstatement available 
in addition to the foregoing  we have in place a multi year  peril specific program from a major reinsurer that is backed by their credit worthiness and the issuance of fully collateralized catastrophe bonds 
under this coverage  we have million of us hurricane coverage in excess of an attachment point of approximately million 
in addition  we have purchased us earthquake coverage with a territorial scope of california  the pacific northwest  and the central us this cover is million part of million of loss incurred in excess of an attachment point of million 
finally  we also purchased a combined us earthquake covering the three territories noted above and us hurricane top layer cover of million part of million of loss incurred in excess of an attachment point of million 
these multi year programs do not have a reinstatement feature 
to keep the expected loss the same each year of these multi year covers  the attachment point is adjusted annually  either up or down  based upon an independent modeling firm s review of the exposure data underlying each program 
fifty percent of the million in excess of the million attachment point in wind coverage  noted above  will expire in june we expect to replace this layer with a like amount of coverage but the final placement will be dependent upon price and terms available at that time 
by way of comparison  the program has potentially approximately million more in coverage for us hurricane and california earthquake than the expiring program but our retention has increased 
we consider our effective retention to be approximately million but this will depend upon the nature of the loss and the interplay between the underlying per risk programs and certain other coverages purchased by individual business units 
second  for losses arising outside of the us and effective july   our core program is made up of two layers 
we have protection of million from a single catastrophic event in excess of the retention of million with two reinstatements 
in addition  we have another layer that provides million in protection in excess of million with one reinstatement 
there is further protection above this core program for specific geographic regions  being million in excess of million for asia pacific and million in excess of million for europe 
each of these top layers has a single reinstatement 
in addition  there are various underlying per risk and catastrophe treaties underlying the core program s retention of million 
in comparison to the prior year  the core program and the specific layers for asia pacific and europe provide the same amount of coverage 
crop insurance we are  and have been since the s  one of the leading writers of crop insurance in the us and conduct that business through rain and hail llc  a managing general agency mga 
we provide protection throughout the us and are therefore geographically diversified  which reduces the risk of exposure to a single event or a heavy accumulation of losses in any one region 
our crop insurance book comprises two components multi peril crop insurance mpci and hail insurance 
the mpci program is a partnership with the us department of agriculture usda 
the policies cover crop losses due to natural causes such as drought  excessive moisture  hail  wind  frost  insects  and disease 
generally  policies have deductibles ranging from percent to percent of the insured s risk 
the usda s risk management agency rma sets the policy terms and conditions  rates and forms  and is also responsible for setting compliance standards 
as a participating company  we report all details of policies underwritten to the rma and are party to a standard reinsurance agreement sra  which sets out the relationship between private insurance companies and the federal government concerning the terms and conditions regarding the risks each will bear 
in addition to the pro rata and excess of loss reinsurance protections inherent in the sra  we cede business on a quota share basis to third party reinsurers and further protect our net retained position through the purchase of stop loss reinsurance in the private market place 
our hail program is a private offering 
we use industry data to develop our own rates and forms for the coverage offered 
the policy primarily protects farmers against yield reduction caused by hail and or fire  and related costs such as transit to storage 
we offer various deductibles to allow the grower to partially self insure for a reduced premium cost 
we limit our hail 
table of contents exposures through the use of township liability limits  quota share reinsurance cessions  and stop loss reinsurance on our net retained hail business 
on the mpci business  we recognize net premiums written as we receive acreage reports from the policyholders on the various crops throughout the us the program has specific timeframes as to when producers must report acreage to us 
these reports allow us to determine the actual premium associated with the liability that is being planted 
once the net premium written has been booked  the premium is then earned over the growing season for the crops 
given the major crops that are covered in the program  we typically see a substantial written premium impact in the second and third quarter and the earned premium is also more concentrated in the second and third quarters 
the premium is earned on the hail program over the coverage period of the policy 
given the very short nature of the growing season  most hail business is typically written in the second and third quarters with the earned premium also more heavily occurring during this time frame 
during the first quarter of each calendar year our mga reports to us the results from the previous crop year 
typically  this results in an adjustment to the previously estimated losses and loss expenses and profit share commission which impacts our policy acquisition costs 
for example  for the quarter ended march   the crop year settlement reduced our losses and loss expenses by approximately million and gave rise to million in profit share commission resulting in a net pre tax benefit to income of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet the short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
as a holding company  ace limited possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries and other investments 
in addition to net investment income  our cash flows currently depend primarily on dividends or other statutorily permissible payments 
historically  these dividends and other payments have come from ace s bermuda based operating subsidiaries  which we refer to as our bermuda subsidiaries 
our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written  fees  net investment income  and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
funds are used at our various companies primarily to pay claims  operating expenses  and dividends and to service debt and purchase investments 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows from these underwriting and investing activities are invested 
global market and economic conditions have been severely disrupted over the past year 
these conditions may potentially affect among other aspects of our business the demand for and claims made under our products  the ability of customers  counterparties and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us  our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources  the risks we assume under reinsurance programs covering variable annuity guarantees  and our investment performance 
however  we believe that our present cash flows from operations  investing activities and financing activities are sufficient to fund our working capital and debt obligation needs 
we do not expect this to change in the near term due in part to factors such as the following ace s balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base 
our shareholders equity was billion at december  cash and aaa rated invested assets were billion at december  our sub prime portfolio represented less than one percent of our investment portfolio at december   and we hold no collateralized debt obligations or collateralized loan obligations 
we provide no credit default protection 
we do not anticipate changes in our core insurance and reinsurance operations which would significantly impact liquidity  and we continue to maintain reinsurance contracts which limit the impact of potential catastrophic events 
our cash flows from operations have been relatively consistent  averaging over a billion per quarter for the last five years 
we expect our core insurance and reinsurance operations to continue to provide us with consistent cash flows going forward 
refer to cash flows  below 
financial flexibility at the holding company level remains strong given our operating companies dividend capacity 
we anticipate minimal refinancing needs of existing debt over the next five years 
beyond five years  our current strategy is to schedule no more than million maturing in any one year 
refer to the contractual obligations and commitments table below 
we have no main credit facility expiring within the next three years  and unused available credit of million at december  we are not reliant on a single bank or group of banks and have not experienced unwillingness by our lenders to permit access to our existing credit facilities 
at december   the minimum consolidated net worth require 
table of contents ment under covenants related to our main credit facilities was billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under applicable covenants was billion 
refer to credit facilities  below 
on december   standard poor s announced that it was revising its outlook on ace limited and ace s core operating insurance companies to positive from stable 
s p also reaffirmed all of ace s counterparty credit and financial strength ratings  including its a financial strength rating for the core operating companies 
this is important since our customers look to our financial strength ratings when assessing our claims paying ability  and certain of our credit facilities include financial strength covenants 
refer to ratings  below 
throughout  we were successful in executing securities repurchase agreements as a low cost financing alternative to short term debt  which allowed us to avoid liquidating higher yielding or temporarily distressed assets in our investment portfolio 
we have not recently relied on the securitization markets for liquidity and therefore are not impacted by its current state 
minimum funding requirements for our pension obligations are immaterial over the next year 
we have filed a shelf registration statement  expiring in december  under which we may issue debt or equity securities 
as an insurance company  one of our principal responsibilities to our clients is to ensure that we have ready access to funds to settle large unforeseen claims 
we expect that positive cash flows from operations underwriting activities and investment income will be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios through to further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims  we hold a certain amount of invested assets in cash and short term investments and maintain available credit facilities refer to credit facilities below 
in addition  for certain insurance  reinsurance  or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows  we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration matched with the related liabilities 
with respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio  we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments 
in a low interest rate environment  the overall duration of our fixed maturity investments tends to be shorter and in a high interest rate environment  such durations tend to be longer 
given the current low rate environment  at december   the average duration of our fixed maturity investments years is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities years 
despite our safeguards  if paid losses accelerated beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows  we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing 
potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time or large scale uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses as a result of coverage disputes  reinsurers credit problems  decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables or increases in collateral postings under our variable annuity reinsurance business 
because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the ace group of companies  the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level 
as a result  the probability of a liquidity strain  as described above  may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis 
if such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary  we could be required to liquidate a portion of our investment  potentially at distressed prices  as well as be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations 
the payments of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction  as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations  including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies  which are discussed below 
during  we were able to meet all of our obligations  including the payment of dividends declared on our ordinary shares  common shares and preferred shares  with our net cash flows and dividends received 
should the need arise  we would expect to have access to the capital markets and other available credit facilities 
we assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors 
considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary s financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision 
the legal restrictions on the payment of dividends from retained earnings by our bermuda subsidiaries are currently satisfied by the share capital and additional paid in capital of each of the bermuda subsidiaries 
in  ace bermuda declared and paid dividends of million million in the prior year period  and ace tempest life re declared and paid dividends of billion nil in the prior year period 
a portion of the dividends received were used in connection with the acquisition of combined insurance 
we expect that a majority of our cash inflows in will be from our bermuda subsidiaries 
the payment of any dividends from ace global markets or its subsidiaries is subject to applicable uk insurance laws and regulations 
in addition  the release of funds by syndicate to subsidiaries of ace global markets is subject to regulations promulgated by the society of lloyd s 
ace ina s us insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends  without prior 
table of contents regulatory approval  subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary s domicile or  if applicable  commercial domicile 
ace ina s international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate 
these laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities 
ace limited did not receive any dividends from ace global markets or ace ina in and the debt issued by ace ina to provide partial financing for the ace ina acquisition and for other operating needs is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by ace ina s insurance subsidiaries to ace ina as well as other group resources 
cash flows our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance  sometimes substantially in advance  of the time claims are paid 
generally  cash flows are affected by claim payments that  due to the nature of our operations  may be comprised of large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods 
refer to contractual obligations and commitments for our estimate for future claim payments by period 
sources of liquidity include cash from operations  routine sales of investments  and financing arrangements 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and our consolidated net cash flows from operating activities were billion in  compared with billion in these amounts reflect net income for each period  adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital 
net income in was billion compared with billion in for  significant adjustments included net realized gains losses of billion  unpaid losses and loss expenses of billion and accounts payable accrued expenses of million 
the unpaid losses and loss expenses were significantly impacted by third quarter catastrophes and the first quarter settlement of the crop hail business 
our consolidated net cash flows used for investing activities were billion in  compared with billion in for the indicated periods  net investing activities were related primarily to net purchases and maturities on the fixed maturities portfolio and for included the acquisition of combined insurance of billion 
our consolidated net cash flows from financing activities were million in  compared with net cash flows used for financing activities of million in net cash flows from financing activities in  include billion net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  partially offset by million of net cash flows used for financing activities relating to the redemption of our preferred shares and dividends on our common and preferred shares of million 
both internal and external forces influence our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
claim settlements  premium levels  and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions 
in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us  and the settlement of the liability for that loss 
we believe that our cash balances  cash flow from operations  routine sales of investments  and the liquidity provided by our credit facilities  as discussed below  are adequate to meet expected cash requirements 
in addition to cash from operations  routine sales of investments  and financing arrangements  we have entered into agreements with a bank provider to implement two international multi currency notional cash pooling programs in order to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency 
in each program  participating ace entities establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider and each day the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency us dollars and then notionally pooled 
the bank extends overdraft credit to any participating ace entity as needed  provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end of each day is at least zero 
actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not co mingled between legal entities 
ace entities may incur overdraft balances as a means to address short term timing mismatches  and any overdraft balances incurred under this program by an ace entity would be guaranteed by ace limited up to million in the aggregate 
our revolving credit facility allows for same day drawings to fund a net pool overdraft should participating ace entities withdraw contributed funds from the pool 
we also utilize reverse securities repurchase agreements as a low cost alternative for short term funding needs 
we utilized this funding source to fund part of the purchase of combined insurance 
refer to short term debt 

table of contents capital resources capital resources consist of funds deployed  or available to be deployed  to support our business operations 
the following table summarizes the components of our capital resources at december  and in millions of us dollars short term debt long term debt total debt trust preferred securities preferred shares common shareholders equity total shareholders equity total capitalization ratio of debt to total capitalization ratio of debt plus trust preferred securities to total capitalization we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short term and long term basis 
our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on  among other things  market conditions and our perceived financial strength 
we have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time 
as part of our capital management program  in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of any ace issued debt or capital securities  which includes common shares  up to million 
at december   this authorization had not been utilized 
we generally maintain shelf registration capacity at all times in order to allow capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs 
our currently effective unlimited shelf registration statement expires in december our ratios of debt to total capitalization and debt plus trust preferred securities to total capitalization have increased due to the decrease in shareholders equity and increase in debt 
the following table reports the significant movements in our shareholders equity for the year ended december  in millions of us dollars total shareholders equity  beginning of year net income dividends declared on common shares dividends declared on preferred shares redemption of preferred shares proceeds from exercise of stock options change depreciation on investments  net of income tax cumulative translation adjustment  net of income tax other movements  net total shareholders equity  end of year total shareholders equity decreased billion in due to several factors 
net income of billion included realized losses after tax of billion on our investment portfolio and net fair value losses of million on gmibs 
the change in net unrealized deprecation on investments of billion was primarily due to the widening of credit spreads and the decline of the global equity markets 
the cumulative translation declined as major currencies declined against the us dollar 

table of contents short term debt at december   short term debt included million of percent unsecured subordinated notes maturing in december  and a million term loan maturing in september refer to long term debt 
in december  ace ina issued million of percent unsecured subordinated notes that mature december  we repaid million of this outstanding amount during we have a million credit default swap in place that has the economic effect of reducing our cost of borrowing associated with this issuance 
the minimum collateral in connection with the credit default swap is million 
in the event that we terminate the swap prematurely  we would be liable for certain transaction costs 
the swap counterparty is a highly rated financial institution and we do not anticipate non performance 
prior to the maturity of the percent unsecured subordinated notes  we will evaluate the public and private debt markets  and if terms at the desired tenor are inconsistent with our capital objectives  we may choose to retire the notes with available cash 
we have executed reverse repurchase agreements with certain counterparties whereby we agreed to sell securities and repurchase them at a date in the future for a predetermined price 
during  these included reverse repurchase agreements totaling billion as part of the financing of the combined insurance acquisition and the october repayment of million of ace us holdings senior notes 
at december   short term debt included million of amounts owed to brokers under reverse repurchase agreements 
these agreements expired on february   at which time we entered into another million reverse repurchase agreement with a day term 
in december  we repaid the australia holdings pty ltd 
aud million million at december  syndicated unsecured term loan 
long term debt our total long term debt of billion is described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  under item in february  ace ina issued million of percent senior notes due march and  in april  we entered into a million unsecured term loan repayable in april the proceeds of the above referenced reverse repurchase agreements  the notes  and the term loan were applied to pay a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of combined insurance 
in connection with the term loan  we simultaneously entered into a million swap transaction that has the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at percent for the term of the loan 
the swap counterparty is a highly rated financial institution and we do not anticipate non performance 
in may  ace ina issued million of percent senior notes  due may the net proceeds plus available cash were used to redeem all million of the percent preferred shares and related depository shares in june refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  under item in december  ace ina holdings entered into a million dual tranche floating interest rate term loan agreement 
the first tranche  a million three year term loan due december  has a floating interest rate based on libor 
simultaneously  we entered into a swap transaction that has the economic effect of fixing the interest rate  excluding fees and expenses  at percent for the full term of the loan 
the second tranche  a million nine month term loan  due september  has a floating interest rate based on libor 
simultaneously  we entered into a swap transaction that has the economic effect of fixing the interest rate  excluding fees and expenses  at percent for the full term of the loan 
the swap counterparty is a highly rated financial institution and we do not anticipate non performance 
the loan is unsecured and repayable on maturity and contains customary limitations on lien provisions as well as customary events of default provisions which  if breached  could result in the accelerated maturity of such debt 
the obligation of the borrower under the loan agreement is guaranteed by ace limited 
trust preferred securities the securities outstanding consist of million of trust preferred securities due  issued by a special purpose entity a trust that is wholly owned by us 
the sole assets of the special purpose entity are debt instruments issued by one or more of our subsidiaries 
the special purpose entity looks to payments on the debt instruments to make payments on the preferred securities 
we have guaranteed the payments on these debt instruments 
the trustees of the trust include one or more of our officers and at least one independent trustee  such as a trust company 
our officers serving as trustees of the trust do not receive any compensation or other remuneration for their services in such capacity 
the full million of outstanding trust preferred securities calculated as million as discussed above plus our equity share of the trust is shown on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability 
additional information with respect to the trust preferred securities is contained in note f to the consolidated financial statements  under item 
table of contents common shares in connection with the continuation  we changed the currency in which the par value of our ordinary shares was stated from us dollars to swiss francs and increased the par value of ordinary shares from to chf 
upon the effectiveness of the continuation  our ordinary shares became common shares 
at december   the par value of the common shares was chf following two quarterly par value reductions in the amount of chf 
refer to effects of the continuation on dividends  below 
effects of the continuation on dividends we have paid dividends each quarter since we became a public company in for information on dividend payment and timing  refer to item of this form k 
under swiss law all dividends and distributions through a reduction in par value must be approved in advance by our shareholders  though the determination of the record and payment dates may be delegated to our board of directors 
swiss law permits distributions to shareholders by way of par value reductions if a after the implementation of the par value reduction the reduced aggregate nominal value of the share capital and the statutory reserves is covered by net assets  b they are approved by shareholders at a general meeting  c our swiss statutory auditor confirms to the general meeting in a written report that the claims of the creditors are fully covered despite the par value reduction  d creditors are informed by way of public notification in the swiss commercial gazette that they can within two months ask for discharge of or the posting of security for their claims and e the par value reduction is registered in the swiss commercial register 
we currently intend  subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the needs of our business  to propose at each annual general meeting  beginning with our annual general meeting in  a reduction in par value that will be effected in four quarterly installments 
the amount of a proposed par value reduction will be based on the board of directors determination of an appropriate us dollar dividend for the succeeding year and will be converted into swiss francs for purposes of obtaining shareholder approval based on the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate shortly before the annual general meeting 
at our annual general meeting  our shareholders approved payments of a dividend in the form of a par value reduction equal to chf per common share in the aggregate equivalent at the time to us per common share  to be paid in three equal quarterly installments of chf each equivalent at the time to us per common share 
dividends  including distributions through a reduction in par value  must be declared by ace in swiss francs 
however  we have arranged it such that these distributions are paid to our shareholders in us dollars at the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate shortly before the payment date 
as a result  under the current process  shareholders will be exposed to fluctuations in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate between the date a dividend amount is determined and the relevant dividend payment date 
for example  on january   we paid a quarterly dividend through a reduction in par value of us per common share to shareholders of record as of december  the payment amount was based on the january   us dollar swiss franc exchange rate of applied to the quarterly par value reduction installment amount of chf referenced above 
should we determine to pay dividends other than by a reduction in par value  under swiss law  such dividends may be paid out only if the corporation has sufficient distributable profits from previous business years  or if the reserves of the corporation are sufficient to allow distribution of a dividend 
the board of directors of a swiss corporation may propose that a dividend be paid  but cannot itself set the dividend 
the company auditors must confirm that the dividend proposal of the board of directors conforms with statutory law 
prior to the distribution of dividends  five percent of the annual profits must be allocated to the general reserve until the amount of general reserves has reached twenty percent of the paid in nominal share capital 
our articles of association can provide for a higher general reserve or for the creation of further reserves setting forth their purpose and use 
once this level has been reached and maintained  the shareholders meeting may approve a distribution of each year s profit within the framework of applicable legal requirements 
dividends paid from retained earnings are usually due and payable immediately after the shareholders resolution relating to the allocation of profits has been passed 
under swiss law  the statute of limitations in respect of claims for dividend payments is five years 
as noted above  for the foreseeable future  we expect to pay dividends as a repayment of share capital in the form of a reduction in par value or qualified paid in capital  which would not be subject to swiss withholding tax 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the table below shows our contractual obligations and commitments including our payments due by period at december  payments due by period in millions of us dollars total less than year years years after years payment amounts determinable from the respective contracts deposit liabilities purchase obligations limited partnerships funding commitments operating leases short term debt long term debt trust preferred securities interest on debt obligations total obligations in which payment amounts are determinable from the respective contracts payment amounts not determinable from the respective contracts estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts estimated payments for future life and annuity policy benefits total contractual obligations and commitments the above table excludes the following items pension obligations minimum funding requirements for our pension obligations are immaterial 
subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary due to many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for more information 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in accordance with issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
the fin liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  was million at december  we recognize accruals for interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
as of december   we had million in liabilities for income tax related interest in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate for the timing of cash settlement with respect to these liabilities 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for more information 
we have no other significant contractual obligations or commitments not reflected in the table above 
deposit liabilities deposit liabilities include reinsurance deposit liabilities of million and contract holder deposit funds of million at december  the reinsurance deposit liabilities arise from contracts we sold for which there is not a significant transfer of risk 
at contract inception  the deposit liability is equal to net cash we received 
an accretion rate is established based on actuarial estimates whereby the deposit liability is increased to the estimated amount payable over the term of the contract 
the deposit accretion rate is the rate of return required to fund expected future payment obligations 
we periodically reassess the estimated ultimate liability and related expected rate of return 
any resulting changes to the amount of the deposit liability are reflected as an adjustment to earnings to reflect the cumulative effect of the period the contract has been in force  and by an adjustment to the future accretion rate of the liability over the remaining estimated contract term 
additional information with respect to deposit liabilities is contained in note k to the consolidated financial statements  under item 
table of contents purchase obligations we are party to enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase certain services 
purchase obligations in the table primarily comprise audit fees and agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services 
limited partnerships funding commitments in connection with our investments in limited partnerships  we have commitments that may require funding of up to million over the next several years 
the timing of the payment of these commitments is uncertain and will differ from our estimated timing in the table 
operating lease commitments we lease office space in most countries in which we operate under operating leases that expire at various dates through december we renew and enter into new leases in the ordinary course of business as required 
estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts we are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts 
such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation as a p c insurance and reinsurance company 
in contrast to other contractual obligations  cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract 
for example  we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts ie  when a loss event has not occurred and if a payment is to be made  the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract 
in the table above  we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at december   and do not take into account reinsurance recoverable 
these estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material 
given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of loss and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future loss and loss expense payments in the table above  differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates 
estimated payments for future life and annuity policy benefits we establish reserves for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts including  but not limited to  gmdbs and gmibs 
the amounts in the table are gross of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts 
the liability for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet is discounted and  with respect to gmib reinsurance  reflected net of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts  and with respect to gmdb reinsurance  does not consider benefit payments related to future fees or premiums not recognized through the balance sheet date 
accordingly  the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet 
payment amounts related to these reserves must be estimated and are not determinable from the contract 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of these payments  actual results could materially differ from the estimates in the table 
credit facilities as our bermuda subsidiaries are not admitted insurers and reinsurers in the us  the terms of certain us insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide locs to clients 
in addition  ace global markets is required to satisfy certain us regulatory trust fund requirements which can be met by the issuance of locs 
locs may also be used for general corporate purposes and for funds at lloyd s 

table of contents the following table shows our main credit facilities by credit line  usage  expiry date  and purpose at december  in millions of us dollars credit line usage expiry date unsecured liquidity facilities ace limited nov 
unsecured operational loc facilities ace limited  nov 
unsecured capital facilities ace limited dec 
total certain facilities are guaranteed by operating subsidiaries and or ace limited 
may also be used for locs 
supports ace global markets underwriting capacity for lloyd s syndicate it is anticipated that the commercial facilities will be renewed on expiry but such renewals are subject to the availability of credit from banks utilized by ace 
in the event that such credit support is insufficient  we could be required to provide alternative security to clients 
this could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources 
the value of letters of credit required is driven by  among other things  loss development of existing reserves  the payment pattern of such reserves  the expansion of business and loss experience of such business 
the facilities in the table above require that we maintain certain covenants  all of which have been met at december  these covenants include but are not limited to i maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth in an amount not less than the minimum amount 
for the purpose of this calculation  the minimum amount is an amount equal to the sum of the base amount currently billion plus percent of consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter  ending after the date on which the current base amount became effective  plus percent of any increase in consolidated net worth during the same period  attributable to the issuance of common and preferred shares 
the minimum amount is subject to an annual reset provision 
ii maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than to under this covenant  debt does not include trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity  except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than percent 
in this circumstance  the amount greater than percent would be included in the debt to total capitalization ratio 
at december   a the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in i above was billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was billion and b our ratio of debt to total capitalization was to our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would  subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants  result in an event of default 
this could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize locs under such facility 
a failure by ace limited or any of its subsidiaries to pay an obligation due for an amount exceeding million would result in an event of default under all of the facilities described above 
ratings ace limited and its subsidiaries are assigned debt and financial strength insurance ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies  including s p  am best  moody s investors service  and fitch 
the ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies 
our internet site  www 
acelimited 
com  also contains some information about our ratings  which can be found under the investor information tab 
financial strength ratings reflect the rating agencies opinions of a company s claims paying ability 
independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets 
the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company  including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company 
these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents  and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold securities 
debt ratings apply to short term and long term debt 
these ratings are assessments of the likelihood that we will make timely payments of principal  interest  and preferred stock dividends 

table of contents it is possible that  in the future  one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings 
if one or more of our ratings were downgraded  we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted 
in addition  our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
for example  the ace global markets capital facility requires that collateral be posted if the s p financial strength rating of ace falls to bbb or lower 
similarly  we have private debt that would require us to post additional collateral if the s p financial strength rating of ace falls to bbb or lower 
also  we have insurance and reinsurance contracts which contain rating triggers 
in the event the s p financial strength rating of ace falls to bbb or lower  we may be faced with the cancellation of premium or be required to post collateral on our underlying obligation associated with this premium 
we estimate that at december   a one notch downgrade of our s p financial strength rating would result in an immaterial loss of premium or requirement for collateral to be posted less than million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
we are exposed to potential losses from various market risks including changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
further  through the writings of certain products such as credit derivatives through our approximately percent ownership of assured guaranty ltd 
and gmib and gmdb products  we are exposed to deterioration in the credit markets  decreases in interest rates  and declines in the equity markets 
our investment portfolio consists of both fixed income and equity securities  denominated in both us dollars and foreign currencies  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates  equity prices  and foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our fixed income and all of our equity securities are classified as available for sale and  as such  changes in interest rates  equity prices  or foreign currency exchange rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
nevertheless  changes in interest rates and equity prices affect consolidated net income when  and if  a security is sold or a determination is made to incur a charge for impairment 
from time to time  we also use investment derivative instruments such as futures  options  swaps  and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of our investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market 
at december  and  our notional exposure to investment derivative instruments was billion and billion  respectively 
in addition  as part of our investing activity  we purchase to be announced mortgage backed securities tbas 
these instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security prices 
changes in the fair value of tbas are included in net realized gains losses and therefore have an immediate effect on both our net income and shareholders equity 
we seek to mitigate market risk using a number of techniques  including maintaining and managing the assets and liabilities of our international operations consistent with the foreign currencies of the underlying insurance and reinsurance businesses  thereby limiting exchange rate risk to net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at december  our policies to address these risks in were not materially different from we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
interest rate risk fixed income portfolio and debt obligations our fixed income portfolio and debt obligations have exposure to interest rate risk 
changes in investment values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our insurance reserves and debt obligations 
we monitor this exposure through periodic reviews of our asset and liability positions 

table of contents the following table shows the impact on the market value of our fixed income portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates of bps applied instantly across the us yield curve an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario at december  and in millions of us dollars fair value of fixed income portfolio pre tax impact of bps increase in interest rates percentage of total fixed income portfolio at fair value changes in interest rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
although our debt  preferred shares redeemed in  and trust preferred securities collectively referred to as debt obligations are reported at amortized value and not adjusted for fair value changes  changes in interest rates could have a material impact on their fair value  albeit there is no immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the following table shows the impact on the market value of our debt obligations of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of bps applied instantly across the us yield curve an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario at december  and in millions of us dollars fair value of debt obligations impact of bps decrease in interest rates percentage of total debt obligations at fair value variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of prepayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results could differ from those reflected in the tables 
equity price risk equity portfolio our portfolio of equity securities  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
in addition  we attain exposure to the equity markets through the use of derivative instruments  which also have exposure to price risk 
our us equity portfolio is correlated with the s p index and changes in that index would approximate the impact on our portfolio 
our international equity portfolio has exposure to a broad range of non us equity markets 
the following table provides more information on our exposure to equity price risk at december  and in millions of us dollars fair value of equity securities pre tax impact of percent decline in market prices for equity exposures changes in the fair value of our equity portfolio are recorded as unrealized appreciation depreciation and are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk many of our non us companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies 
therefore  foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies 
foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process 
locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british pound sterling  the euro  and the canadian dollar 
the following table provides more information on our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk at december  and in millions of us dollars fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies percentage of fair value of total net assets pre tax impact on equity of hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar reinsurance of gmdb and gmib guarantees our net income is directly impacted by changes in the reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees  primarily gmdb and gmib 
these reserves are calculated in accordance with sop sop reserves and changes in these reserves are reflected as life and annuity benefit expense  which is included in life underwriting income 
in addition  our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the gmib liability fvl  which is classified as a derivative according to fas the fair value liability established for a gmib reinsurance contract represents the difference between the fair value of the contract and the sop reserves 
changes in the fair value of the gmib liability  net of associated changes in the calculated sop reserve  are reflected as realized gains or losses 
ace views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance  with the probability of long term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing 
adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income 
when evaluating these risks  we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long term economic net loss  as well as the short term accounting variations caused by these market movements 
therefore  we evaluate this business in terms of its long term economic risk and reward 
the ultimate risk to the variable annuity guaranty reinsurance business is a long term underperformance of investment returns  which can be exacerbated by a long term reduction in interest rates 
following a market downturn  continued market underperformance over a period of five to seven years would eventually result in a higher level of paid claims as policyholders accessed their guarantees through death or annuitization 
however  if market conditions improved following a downturn  sop reserves and fair value liability would fall reflecting a decreased likelihood of future claims  which would result in an increase in both life underwriting income and net income 
as of december   management established the sop reserve based on the benefit ratio calculated using actual market values at december  management exercises judgment in determining the extent to which short term market movements impact the sop reserve 
the sop reserve is based on the calculation of a long term benefit ratio or loss ratio for the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance 
despite the long term nature of the risk the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short term market movements that may be judged by management to be temporary or transient 
management will  in keeping with the language in sop  regularly examine both quantitative and qualitative analysis and management will determine if  in its judgment  the change in the calculated benefit ratio is of sufficient magnitude and has persisted for a sufficient duration to warrant a change in the benefit ratio used to establish the sop reserve 
this has no impact on either premium received or claims paid nor does it impact the long term profit or loss of the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance 
the sop reserve and fair value liability calculations are directly affected by market factors  including equity levels  interest rate levels  credit risk and implied volatilities  as well as policyholder behaviors  such as annuitization and lapse rates 
the table below shows the sensitivity  as of december   of the sop reserves and fair value liability associated with the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio 
in addition  the tables below show the sensitivity of the fair value of specific derivative instruments held hedge value  which includes instruments purchased in january  to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio 
although these derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment  some portion of the change in value may be used to offset changes in the sop reserve 

table of contents the following table provides more information on our exposure to variable annuity sensitivities to equities and interest rates at december  worldwide equity shock interest rate shock flat in millions of us dollars bps increase decrease in sop reserve increase decrease in net fvl increase decrease in hedge value increase decrease in net income flat increase decrease in sop reserve increase decrease in net fvl increase decrease in hedge value increase decrease in net income bps increase decrease in sop reserve increase decrease in net fvl increase decrease in hedge value increase decrease in net income a rated credit spreads interest rate volatility equity volatility sensitivities to other economic variables in millions of us dollars increase decrease in sop reserve increase decrease in net fvl increase decrease in hedge value increase decrease in net income mortality lapses annuitization sensitivities to actuarial assumptions in millions of us dollars increase decrease in sop reserve increase decrease in net fvl increase decrease in hedge value increase decrease in net income the above table assumes equity shocks impact all global equity markets equally and that the interest rate shock is a parallel shift in the us yield curve 
although our liabilities have sensitivity to global equity markets we would suggest using the s p as a proxy and although our liabilities have sensitivity to global interest rates at various points on the yield curve we would suggest using the year us treasury yield as a proxy 
a change in a rated credit spreads impacts the rate used to discount cash flows in the fair value model 
the table above demonstrates  for example  that a percent decrease in worldwide equities  all else equal  would increase our sop reserves by million subject to management judgment as described above and cause a net realized loss of million  offset by an increase in hedge value of million  for a total reduction in net income of million 
the hedge sensitivity is from december  market levels  but includes hedges entered into in january because the new hedges were purchased after december   the increase decrease in hedge value for each of the above scenarios relative to december  market conditions  would be million lower higher 
the above sensitivities are not directly additive  because changes in one factor will affect the sensitivity to changes in other factors 
also  the sensitivities do not scale linearly and may be proportionally greater for larger movements in the market factors 
the calculation of the sop reserve and fair value liability is based on internal models that include assumptions regarding future policyholder behavior  including lapse  annuitization  and asset allocation 
these assumptions impact both the absolute level of the sop reserve and fair value liability as well as the sensitivities to changes in market factors shown above 

table of contents if the global equity market were to experience a percent decrease from levels at december   all else being equal  any additional incremental capital required over the increase in sop reserves  would be approximately offset by the increase in value of currently held hedge assets 
changes in other market factors have a minor impact on required capital 
however  we would be required to post additional collateral 
from inception july to december   the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio has produced the following cumulative results 
any increase in sop reserves and fair value liability should be taken in context of these results net premiums earned billion claims paid million sop reserves held at december  million fair value gmib liability held at december  million life underwriting income million net loss million
