overview we develop  manufacture and market the invos system  a non invasive patient monitoring system that continuously measures changes in the blood oxygen levels in the brain and elsewhere in the body in tissues beneath the sensor in patients with or at risk for restricted blood flow 
we began commercializing our model invos system internationally in the third quarter of fiscal and in the united states in the fourth quarter of fiscal unlike earlier models  the model has the added capability of being able to monitor pediatric patients 
from product launch until the first quarter of fiscal  we focused our marketing efforts primarily on adult and pediatric cardiac surgeries and carotid artery surgeries 
during the second quarter of fiscal  results of both the first prospective  randomized clinical trial and a larger retrospective review evaluating the invos system were presented  which we believe have contributed to the invos system gaining further market penetration 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we initiated selling and marketing efforts for the invos system in the pediatric intensive care unit  or icu 
we are currently expanding the use of our invos system in the pediatric and neonatal icu s with the launch of our smaller sensor in the first half of fiscal in november  we received k clearance from the fda to market our invos system to monitor changes in somatic tissue blood oxygen saturation in regions of the body other than the brain in patients with or at risk for restricted blood flow 
in may  we received k clearance from the fda to market our invos system to monitor changes in blood oxygen saturation in any tissues beneath the sensor  not limited to brain and somatic tissue  in any individual 
our four channel cerebral and somatic invos system monitor  which we launched in the second quarter of  can display information from four disposable sensors 
this feature allows for the simultaneous monitoring of changes in blood oxygen saturation in tissues beneath the sensor in four different places in the body in patients with or at risk for restricted blood flow  in somatic tissue 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of icu data systems  inc  a technology development company  for approximately  in cash plus the assumption of specified liabilities 
icu data systems has developed a patented technology that integrates data from a broad array of hospital bedside devices  such as physiological monitors  ventilators and infusion devices  into a single bedside display for comparison  data management and storage 
we plan to further develop and launch our newly acquired data integration technology as a stand alone device in mid the invos system is one of many devices whose data can be integrated into the stand alone device 
to support the addition of the derived parameter features to the system  we will pursue a new fda k clearance in in addition  we expect to invest to combine the icu data systems and invos system technologies in a single product for launch expected in the second half of we also plan to pursue a new fda k clearance for this integrated device in 
table of contents net revenues and cost of sales we derive our revenues primarily from sales of invos systems to hospitals in the united states through our direct sales team and independent sales representative firms  although we expect to derive modest revenues in fiscal from our newly acquired data integration technology  which we plan to launch as a stand alone device in mid through our direct sales team 
outside the united states  we have distribution agreements with independent distributors for the invos system  including covidien  formerly tyco healthcare  in europe  canada  the middle east and south africa  and edwards lifesciences ltd 
in japan 
our cost of sales represent the cost of producing monitors and disposable sensors 
revenues from outside the united states contributed percent to our fiscal net revenues 
as a percentage of net revenues  the gross margins from our international sales are typically lower than gross margins from our us sales  reflecting the difference between the prices we receive from distributors and from direct customers 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  the product has been delivered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the product is considered delivered to the customer once we have shipped it  as this is when title and risk of loss have transferred 
payment terms are generally net days for us sales and net days or longer for international sales 
our invos system revenues are derived from the sale of monitors and our disposable sensors 
we intend that disposable sensors will form the basis of a recurring revenue stream 
in addition  we offer to our customers in the united states a no capital cost sales program whereby we ship the invos system monitor to the customer at no charge 
under this program  we do not recognize any revenue upon the shipment of the monitor 
at the time of shipment of the monitor  we capitalize the monitor as an asset and depreciate this asset over five years  and this depreciation is included in cost of goods sold 
we recognize sensor revenue when we receive purchase orders and ship the product to the customer 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses generally consist of salaries  wages and related expenses of our employees and consultants  sales and marketing expenses  such as employee sales commissions  commissions to independent sales representatives  travel  entertainment  advertising  education and training expenses  depreciation of demonstration monitors and attendance at selected medical conferences  clinical research expenses  such as costs of supporting clinical trials  and general and administrative expenses  such as the cost of corporate operations  professional services  stock compensation  insurance  warranty and royalty expenses  investor relations  depreciation and amortization  facilities expenses and other general operating expenses 
we have increased the size of our direct sales team from persons at the end of fiscal to persons at the end of fiscal we expect to increase the size of our us direct sales team in fiscal and are planning to hire direct salespersons and clinical specialists in europe to support covidien 
we also expect increased sales and marketing expenses and increased stock compensation expenses in fiscal as a result  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses consist of salaries  wages and related expenses of our research and development personnel and consultants  costs of various development projects  and costs of preparing and processing applications for fda clearance of new products 
for the fiscal year ended november   we recorded a research and development expense of  in connection with our former contract development and exclusive licensing agreement with neurophysics corporation 

table of contents we expect our research and development expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of development costs associated with our newly acquired data integration technology  development costs associated with our contract development agreement with shirley research corporation and the addition of research and development personnel 
deferred tax assets and impairment charges for the fiscal year ended november   we adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of additional deferred tax assets due to expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition of this additional deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash net tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal of  for the fiscal year ended november   we recognized income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of percent on our statement of operations 
this income tax expense included a non cash tax expense on our statement of operations for fiscal of  in november  we wrote off obsolete inventory of for the fiscal year ended november   we recognized income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of percent on our statement of operations 
this income tax expense included a non cash tax expense on our statement of operations for fiscal of  in addition  during fiscal we recognized deferred tax assets related to the exercise of stock options of approximately  these assets were recognized in additional paid in capital on our balance sheet because they were utilized and reduced current taxes payable 
results of operations fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  net revenues 
our net revenues increased  or percent  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in us sales of  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in us sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of the disposable sensor of  or percent  primarily as a result of a percent increase in sensor unit sales 
in addition  sales of the invos system monitor in the united states increased  or percent  primarily as a result of increased purchases by pediatric hospitals  and an increase in international sales of  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in international sales was primarily due to increased purchases of our invos system monitor and disposable sensors of  by covidien in europe  and  by edwards lifesciences in japan 
in fiscal  international sales represented percent of our net revenues  compared to percent of our net revenues in fiscal purchases by covidien accounted for percent of net revenues in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal in the united states  we sold  disposable sensors in fiscal  and internationally  we sold  we placed invos system monitors in the united states and internationally in fiscal  and our installed base of invos system monitors in the united states was  in hospitals  as of november  
table of contents sales of our products as a percentage of net revenues were as follows fiscal year ended november  product sensors invos system monitors total we believe that the current economic downturn in the united states and abroad could significantly lengthen the sales cycle for our products and reduce the growth in our net revenues in fiscal gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was percent for the fiscal year ended november  and percent for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease in our gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to increased international sales  due to lower margins we receive on sales to our international distributors 
this decrease was partially offset by a six percent increase in the average selling price of disposable sensors in the united states  which is attributable to increased sales of our pediatric sensors  which sell for a higher price than the adult sensor 
research  development and engineering expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses increased  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in salaries of  due to the addition of research and development personnel in fiscal and  and increased costs associated with advances to the design and performance features of our invos system monitor and disposable sensors of  we expect our research  development and engineering expenses to increase in fiscal primarily as a result of development costs associated with development of our newly acquired data integration technology as a stand alone device  development of a single product combining the data integration technology with our invos system technology  development costs associated with advances to the design and performance features of the invos system  including the disposable sensor  development costs associated with our contract development agreement with shirley research corporation and the hiring of additional research and development personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or percent  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november   primarily due to a  increase in salaries  wages  commissions and related expenses  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees  principally in sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  and an increase in salaries of existing employees  an  increase in travel  marketing and selling related expenses as a result of our increased sales personnel and increased sales and marketing activities  including sales training and trade shows  a  increase in stock compensation expense due to stock compensation issued to our officers  employees  directors and one of our consultants in fiscal  and  a  increase in professional service fees  primarily due to increased legal  auditing and tax fees  a  increase in accrued incentive compensation expense due to our fiscal year financial performance  primarily increased sales and operating income in accordance with the incentive compensation plans  and a  increase in office and facility expenses primarily as a result of increased employees 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in commissions paid to our independent sales representative firms as a result of fewer independent sales representative firms in fiscal  and a  decrease in clinical research expense primarily as a result of a grant made in fiscal for the support of neonatal research 

table of contents we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal  primarily as a result of our hiring additional direct sales personnel in fiscal and  increased employee sales commissions payable as a result of increased sales  increased sales and marketing expenses and increased stock compensation expenses 
other income 
during fiscal  interest income decreased to  from  in fiscal  primarily due to decreased interest rates  decreased investment balances  and the use of cash for the repurchase of common shares  partially offset by our increased cash and cash equivalents balances as a result of cash provided by operating activities and maturities and redemptions of investments

the increase in our average selling prices in the united states is attributable to increased sales of our pediatric sensor  which sells for a higher price than the adult sensor 
research  development and engineering expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses decreased  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a  initial fee under our contract development and exclusive licensing agreement entered into with neurophysics corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or percent  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november   primarily due to a  increase in salaries  wages and related expenses  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees  principally in sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  and an increase in salaries of existing employees  an  increase in travel  marketing and selling related expenses as a result of our increased sales personnel and increased sales and marketing activities  including sales training  product sponsorship  trade shows and advertising  an  increase in employee sales commissions as a result of increased sales and hiring additional sales employees in fiscal a  increase in accrued incentive compensation expense due to our fiscal year financial performance  primarily increased sales and operating income in accordance with the incentive compensation plans  a  increase in stock compensation expense due to stock compensation issued to directors  officers  employees and a consultant in fiscal and  a  increase in clinical research expenses primarily as a result of a grant for neonatal research and a clinical trial evaluating the use of the invos system on diabetic patients over age  and a  increase in corporate insurance expenses due to increased coverage limits and increased premiums 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in commissions paid to our independent sales representative firms as a result of fewer independent sales representative firms in fiscal other income 
during fiscal  interest income increased to  from  in fiscal  primarily due to our increased cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investment balances as a result of cash provided by operating activities and the proceeds from our public offering of common shares that closed in the second quarter of fiscal  and increased interest rates 
income taxes 
as of november   we recognized income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of percent on our statement of operations  and we expect this to continue for future periods 
as of november   we further adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of additional deferred tax assets as a result of expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition of this additional deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal of  and increased our net income for fiscal to  or per diluted common share 
for fiscal  the reversal of our valuation allowance was net of recorded taxes 
the net income tax benefit of  consisted of income tax expense recorded at an estimated effective tax rate of percent in the amount of  for the first three quarters of fiscal  and a net deferred tax benefit of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations in the past three years 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our principal sources of operating funds have been the proceeds from sales of our common shares and cash provided by operating activities

marketable securities and long term investments consist of aaa rated united states government agency bonds and treasury bills  and cash and cash equivalents are currently invested in bank savings accounts and money market accounts  pending their ultimate use 
on march   we completed a public offering of  of our newly issued common shares at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds  after deducting the underwriting discount and the expense of the offering  were  in april  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common shares 
purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the prices  timing and amount of  and purposes for  any purchases will be determined by management 
in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common shares  and in july  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common shares  for a total of million of our common shares under the repurchase program 
during fiscal  we repurchased  common shares at an average price of per share and an aggregate cost of  leaving  in dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the repurchase program

we entered into a contract development and exclusive licensing agreement with neurophysics corporation as of september  the agreement provided us with feasibility research  contract development and consulting services and certain ownership and licensing rights  subject to the rights of the united states federal government  to intellectual property and technical knowledge associated with several novel near infrared spectroscopy  or nirs  and imaging technologies and products under development at neurophysics 
we paid an initial license fee of  we terminated this agreement in february  except for various provisions regarding our ownership of the technology related to the potential new products 
in february  we entered into a similar agreement with shirley research corporation and hugh f 
stoddart and hugh a 
stoddart  and have agreed to pay monthly development and consulting fees of  a month during the term of the agreement and a royalty on future sales of the new products 
we believe that cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments on hand at november  will be adequate to satisfy our operating and capital requirements for more than the next twelve months 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operations during fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash was provided primarily by  of income before income taxes and non cash depreciation  amortization  stock compensation expense and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises  a  decrease in accrued interest income  primarily due to our decreased marketable securities and long term investment balances primarily due to the use of cash from maturing investments for the repurchase of common shares and decreased interest rates  a  increase in accounts payable  primarily as a result of increased inventory and operating expenses  partially offset by more timely payments made to vendors  and a  increase in accrued liabilities  primarily as a result of an increase in accrued state  local and property taxes and accrued sales commissions as a result of our fiscal financial performance 
cash provided by operations in fiscal was partially offset by a  increase in inventories  primarily due to the acquisition of components associated with our disposable sensors and our invos system monitor due to anticipated sales  inventories on our balance sheet increased less because we capitalized invos system monitors to property and equipment that are being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment  as described below  a  increase in accounts receivable  primarily as a result of higher fourth quarter sales in fiscal than in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by the timing of more of the sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal towards the end of the quarter  and a  increase in deferred income tax benefits as a result of payments made for estimated alternative minimum tax that we expect will result in future tax credits when we use our net operating loss carryforwards 
we expect our working capital requirements to increase as sales increase 
the increase in inventories described above is greater than shown on our balance sheet because it includes invos system monitors that we capitalized because they are being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment 
we capitalized  of costs from inventory for invos system monitors being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment at customers during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal as of november   we have capitalized  in costs for invos system monitors being used as demonstration and no capital cost sales equipment  and these assets have a net book value of  we depreciate these assets over five years 
we believe that the current economic downturn in the united states and abroad could significantly lengthen our collection cycle for our accounts receivable and  as a result  increase our accounts receivable balances

new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb adopted fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and requires an assessment of the probability of the validity of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns for recognition in financial statements 
only tax positions meeting a more likely than not threshold of being sustained are recognized under fin fin also provides guidance on classification of interest and penalties and accounting and disclosures for annual and interim financial statements 
we adopted fin effective december   for our fiscal year the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe our most significant accounting policies relate to our accounting treatment of stock compensation of employees  our accounting treatment for income taxes  our revenue recognition associated with our no capital cost sales program  and our recognition of a technology acquisition cost intangible asset and goodwill 
stock compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement requires that compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including stock options  stock appreciation rights and restricted stock be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement was effective for our fiscal quarter beginning december  we adopted this statement for fiscal using a modified prospective application and  accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 

table of contents we previously accounted for stock based compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation costs for stock options granted to employees were measured as the excess  if any  of the market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
stock based compensation of consultants and advisors was determined based on the fair value of the options or warrants on the grant date pursuant to the methodology of sfas no 
 estimated using the black scholes model 
the resulting amount was recognized as compensation expense and an increase in additional paid in capital over the vesting period of the options or warrants 
in november  we approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested stock options as of november  the primary purpose of this accelerated vesting was to eliminate compensation expense we would recognize in our results of operations upon the adoption of sfas r  which was effective for our fiscal quarter beginning december  after the effects of the accelerated vesting  the initial adoption of sfas r was immaterial with respect to options granted before december  the issuance of additional stock compensation under the stock incentive plan in fiscal  and had an impact on our financial statements 
during fiscal  we granted  stock options to our employees  directors and officers  and we issued  restricted common shares to our officers and employees 
during fiscal  we granted  stock options to our employees  directors and one of our officers  and we issued  restricted common shares to one of our officers 
during fiscal  we granted  stock options to our officers  employees  directors and one of our consultants  and we issued  restricted common shares to our officers 
these stock options and restricted shares were issued at the market price on the date of grant  and they vest and are expensed in the financial statements over five years 
as a result of the stock options and restricted common shares that we granted during fiscal  and  we have recorded  in stock compensation expense in fiscal in accordance with sfas no

as of november   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation awards granted under the plan 
that cost was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
no modifications were made to any share awards that required an accounting charge  and no cash was paid for share based liabilities during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal the fair value of the stock option grants was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal  and expected volatility the measure by which the stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during the period for and for  risk free interest rate approximate us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant of for and  expected lives of approximately years  and a dividend yield of 
the fair value of the restricted common shares was estimated based on the market value of the common shares on the date of issuance 
different assumptions could significantly change the calculated grant date fair value  and  therefore  the amount of stock compensation expense we recognize over the vesting period of the awards 
we believe  however  that our estimates are appropriate 
income taxes we have performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding realization of our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses over our history up to the most recent six fiscal years  and our forecast for future net income 
our assessment of our deferred tax assets included making assumptions about the growth of our net revenues and pre tax 
table of contents income in future years  making allowance for the uncertainties regarding  among other things  our future rate of growth in net revenues  the rate of adoption of our products in the marketplace  and the potential for competition to enter the marketplace 
as of november   we have concluded that it is more likely than not that approximately  of such assets will be realized 
the remaining tax benefits of  relating to stock option exercises will not be recognized on our financial statements until the reduce current taxes payable 
the benefit  when recognized  will increase additional paid in capital 
during fiscal  we recognized deferred tax assets of approximately  in additional paid in capital because they were utilized and reduced current taxes payable 
for the fiscal year ended november   we recorded income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of percent  and for the year ended november  we recorded income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of percent 
during fiscal  we adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a net deferred tax asset of  related to the expected future benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
for fiscal  the adjustment of our valuation allowance was net of recorded taxes 
for the fiscal year ended november   the recorded net income tax benefit of  consisted of income tax expense recorded at an estimated effective tax rate of percent in the amount of  for the first three quarters of fiscal and a net deferred tax benefit of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal for fiscal  the effect of recognizing this asset on our balance sheet  and associated tax benefit on our statement of operations  is to increase our net income to  or per diluted common share 
given the assumptions inherent in our financial plans  it is possible to calculate a different value for our deferred tax asset by changing one or more of the variables in our assessment 
however  we believe that our evaluation of our financial plans was reasonable  and that the judgments and assumptions that we made at the time of developing the plan were appropriate 
no capital cost sales revenue recognition we offer to our customers in the united states a no capital cost sales program whereby we ship the invos system monitor to the customer at no charge 
under this program  we do not recognize any revenue upon the shipment of the invos system monitor 
we recognize sensor revenue when we receive purchase orders and ship the product to the customer 
at the time of shipment of the monitor  we capitalize the invos system monitor as an asset and depreciate this asset over five years 
we believe this is consistent with our stated revenue recognition policy  which is compliant with staff accounting bulletin no 
 and we have considered emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
technology acquisition costs intangible asset and goodwill technology acquisition costs and goodwill are related to our november acquisition of substantially all of the assets of icu data systems  inc  a technology development company  for approximately  in cash plus the assumption of specified liabilities 
goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price of the acquired business exceeds the estimated fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets of the acquired business  in addition to transaction costs recorded at cost 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
the technology acquisition costs intangible asset has an estimated useful life of years  based on several patents that we have filed related to the technology  and will be amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life 
intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed annually for impairment at the end of our fiscal year  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
we evaluate impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset  determined using a cash flow method  with its carrying value 
no amortization expense was recorded related to the technology acquisition costs intangible asset for because the transaction closed in november as of november   the carrying value of the technology acquisition costs intangible asset was  and the carrying value of the goodwill was we estimated the value of the technology acquisition costs intangible asset based on a valuation model that included estimating the future cash flows of the technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return discount rate 
the discount rate used was determined at the 
table of contents time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
our assessment of the estimated fair value included making assumptions about the expected net revenues and operating income related to the acquired technology in future years  making allowance for the uncertainties regarding  among other things  the time and cost associated with the further advancement of the design and performance of the technology to ready it for market launch  the rate of adoption of the technology once it is launched into the marketplace  and the potential for competition related to the launched technology 
given the assumptions inherent in our valuation model  it is possible to calculate a different value for our technology acquisition costs intangible asset by changing one or more of the variables within our model 
however  we believe that our evaluation of our valuation model was reasonable  and that the judgments and assumptions that we made at the time of developing the model upon acquisition of icu data systems  inc were appropriate
