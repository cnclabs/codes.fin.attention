item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if our network marketing activities do not comply with government regulations  our business could suffer 
many governmental agencies regulate our network marketing activities 
a government agency s determination that our business or our independent associates have significantly violated a law or regulation could adversely affect our business 
the laws and regulations regulating network marketing generally intend to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes 
our business faces constant regulatory scrutiny due to the interpretive and enforcement discretion given to regulators  periodic misconduct by our independent associates  adoption of new laws or regulations  and changes in the interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations 
in july  the texas attorney general filed suit against us  mannarelief ministries  samuel l 
caster  the fisher institute  and h 
reginald mcdaniel alleging violations of the texas deceptive trade practices act and the texas food  drug  and cosmetic act 
on february   we reached an agreement with the texas attorney general s office settling the enforcement action 
without admitting any wrongdoing  we have agreed to return up to million to members only  and to pay million to cover fees and expenses of texas regulators 
the settlement does not include any fine or penalty against mannatech 
we have also made and agreed to make certain corporate governance changes required by the texas attorney general s office and agreed not to violate certain provisions of the texas deceptive trade practices act and texas food  drug  and cosmetic act 
if we are unable to comply fully with the provisions of the settlement  texas regulators could pursue further remedies that may impact our business 
in addition  in the past and as a result of the industry in which we operate  we have experienced inquiries regarding specific independent associates 
we have complied and fully cooperated with all regulatory agencies in connection with such inquiries and are also required by regulatory authorities to disclose any on going significant regulatory actions 
if government regulations regarding network marketing change or are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to our business  we may be subject to new enforcement actions and material limitations regarding our overall business model 
network marketing is always subject to extensive governmental regulations  including foreign  federal  and state regulations 
any detrimental change in legislation and regulations could affect our business 
furthermore  significant penalties could be imposed on us for failure to comply with various statutes or regulations 
violations may result from misconduct by us or our independent associates  ambiguity in statutes  regulations and related court decisions  the discretion afforded to regulatory authorities and courts interpreting and enforcing laws  and new regulations or interpretations of regulations affecting our business 
if we violate governmental regulations or fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  our operations could be adversely affected 
our operation is subject to extensive laws  governmental regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions  and similar constraints at the federal  state  and local levels in our domestic and foreign markets 
these regulations primarily involve the following the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale  and storage of our products  the health and safety of dietary supplements  cosmetics and foods  trade practice laws and network marketing laws  our product claims and advertising by our independent associates  our network marketing system  pricing restrictions regarding transactions with our foreign subsidiaries or other related parties and similar regulations that affect our level of foreign taxable income  the assessment of customs duties  further taxation of our independent associates  which may obligate us to collect additional taxes and maintain additional records  and export and import restrictions 
any unexpected new regulations or changes in existing regulations could significantly restrict our ability to continue operations  which could adversely affect our business 
for example  changes regarding health and safety  and food and drug regulations for our nutritional products could require us to reformulate our products to comply with such regulations 
in some foreign countries  nutritional products are considered foods  while other countries consider them drugs 
future health and safety  or food and drug  regulations could delay or prevent our introduction of new products or suspend or prohibit the sale of existing products in a given country or marketplace 
in addition  if we expand into other foreign markets  our operations or products could also be affected by the general stability of foreign governments and the regulatory environment relating to network marketing and our products 
if our products are subject to high customs duties  our sales and competitive position could suffer as compared to locally produced goods 
furthermore  import restrictions in certain countries and jurisdictions could limit our ability to import products from the united states 
increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements as well as new regulations that are being adopted in some of our markets with respect to nutritional supplements could result in more restrictive regulations and harm our results if our supplements or advertising activities are found to violate existing or new regulations or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations 
there has been an increasing movement in the united states and other markets to increase the regulation of dietary supplements  which will impose additional restrictions or requirements 
in several of our markets  new regulations have been adopted or are likely to be adopted in the near term that will impose new requirements  make changes in some classifications of supplements under the regulations  or limit the claims we can make 
in addition  there has been increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements and marketing claims under existing and new regulations 
in europe for example  we are unable to market supplements that contain ingredients that have not been previously marketed in europe novel foods without going through an extensive registration and approval process 
europe is also expected to adopt additional regulations this fall setting new limits on acceptable levels of nutrients 
the fda has implemented gmps for the us nutritional supplement industry 
our operations could be harmed if new regulations require us to reformulate products or effect new registrations  if regulatory authorities make determinations that any of our products do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations 
in addition  our operations could be harmed if governmental laws or regulations are enacted that restrict the ability of companies to market or distribute nutritional supplements or impose additional burdens or requirements on nutritional supplement companies 
if our international markets are not successful  our business could suffer 
we currently sell our products in the international markets of canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  germany  south africa  and singapore 
nonetheless  our international operations could experience changes in legal and regulatory requirements  as well as difficulties in adapting to new foreign cultures and business customs 
if we do not adequately address such issues  our international markets may not meet growth expectations 
our international operations and future expansion plans are subject to political  economic  and social uncertainties  including inflation  the renegotiation or modification of various agreements  increases in custom duties and tariffs  changes and limits in export controls  government regulations and laws  trademark availability and registration issues  changes in exchange rates  changes in taxation  wars and other hostilities  and changes in the perception of network marketing 
any negative changes related to these factors could adversely affect our business  profitability  and growth prospects 
furthermore  any negative changes in our distribution channels may force us to invest significant time and money related to our distribution and sales to maintain our position in certain international markets 
if our information technology system fails  our operations could suffer 
like many companies  our business is heavily dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage and operate many of our key business functions  including order processing  supply chain management  customer service  product distribution  commission processing  cash receipts and payments  and financial reporting 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fires  earthquakes  telecommunications failures and other events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
although we maintain an extensive security system and disaster recovery program that was developed under the guidelines published by the national institute of standards of technology  a long term failure or impairment of any of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct day to day business 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits 
in and  we recognized and  respectively  of our net sales in markets outside of the united states 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the united states dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted average exchange rate 
if the united states dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies  there is a risk our reported sales  operating expenses  and net income could significantly fluctuate 
we are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations  nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations 
however  to help mitigate this risk  our management monitors applicable exchange rates 
to date we have not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities 
we may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our independent associates  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our independent associates are subject to taxation and  in some instances  legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes  such as value added taxes  and to maintain appropriate records 
in addition  we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors 
in the event that local laws and regulations or the interpretation of local laws and regulations change to require us to treat our independent distributors as employees  or that our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations  we may be held responsible for social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions  plus any related assessments and penalties  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate significantly 
the price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases 
decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock 
the price of our common stock and the price at which we could sell securities in the future could significantly fluctuate in response to broad market fluctuations and general economic conditions  fluctuations in our financial results  future securities offerings  changes in the market s perception of our products or our business  including false or negative publicity  governmental regulatory actions  the outcome of any lawsuits  financial and business announcements made by us or our competitors  the general condition of the industry  and the sale of large amounts of stock by insiders 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies 
the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the price of our common stock in the open market could fluctuate based on factors that have little or nothing to do with us or that are outside of our control 
certain shareholders  directors  and officers own a significant amount of our stock  which could allow them to influence corporate transactions and other matters 
as of december   our directors and executive officers  collectively with their families and affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our total outstanding common stock 
as a result  if any of these shareholders choose to act together based on their current share ownership  they may be able to control a significant percentage of the total outstanding shares of our common stock  which could affect the outcome of a shareholder vote on the election of directors  the adoption of stock option plans  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  or the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that may help discourage a change of control 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws  and the texas business corporation act help discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire our company  even if the proposal may benefit our shareholders 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval 
our board of directors has the power to determine the price and terms of any preferred stock 
the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without shareholders approval could deter or delay unsolicited changes of control by discouraging open market purchases of our common stock or a non negotiated tender or exchange offer for our common stock 
discouraging open market purchases may be disadvantageous to our shareholders who may otherwise desire to participate in a transaction in which they would receive a premium for their shares 
in addition  other provisions may also discourage a change of control by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
our charter documents provide for three classes of directors on our board of directors with members of each class serving staggered three year terms 
also  the texas business corporation act restricts  subject to exceptions  business combinations with any affiliated shareholder 
any or all of these provisions could delay  deter or help prevent a takeover of our company and could limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
we are not required to pay dividends  and our board of directors could decide not to declare a dividend or could reduce the amount of the dividend at any time 
while we have historically paid dividends since  the declaration of dividends on our common stock is solely within the discretion of our board of directors  subject to limitations under texas law stipulating that dividends may not be paid if payment therefore would cause the corporation to be insolvent or if the amount of the dividend would exceed the surplus of the corporation 
our board of directors could at any time decide not to declare a dividend  or could reduce the level of our dividend payments  or we could be prevented from declaring a dividend because of legal or contractual restrictions 
the failure to pay a dividend could reduce our stock price 
concentration risk a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our core ambrotose complex products which include the ambrotose products and advanced ambrotose products 
a decline in sales value of such legacy products could have a material adverse effect on our earnings  cash flows  and financial position 
revenue from the core ambrotose products were as follows for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages sales by product of total net sales sales by product of total net sales advanced ambrotose ambrotose total we are not exposed to customer concentration risk as no single independent associate has ever accounted for more than of our consolidated net sales 
circumstances and conditions may change 
accordingly  additional risks and uncertainties not currently known  or that we currently deem not material  may also adversely affect our business operations

company overview since november  we have continued to develop innovative  high quality  proprietary nutritional supplements  topical and skin care products  and weight management products that are sold through a global network marketing system operating in the united states  canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  germany  south africa  and singapore 
the united states location processes orders for the united states  canada  and south africa 
the australian location process orders for australia  new zealand  and singapore 
the united kingdom location processes orders for the united kingdom  denmark  and germany 
the switzerland office was created to manage certain day to day business needs of non north american markets and coordinates our continued global expansion 
we operate as a single business segment and primarily sell our products through a network of approximately  independent associates and members who have purchased our products and or packs within the last months  which we refer to as current independent associates and members 
we operate as a seller of nutritional supplements through our network marketing distribution channels operating in twelve different countries 
we review and analyze our net sales by geographical location and further analyze our net sales by packs and by products 
each of our subsidiaries sells the same types of products and possesses similar economic characteristics  such as selling prices and gross margins 
because we sell our products through network marketing distribution channels  the opportunities and challenges that affect us most are recruitment and retention of independent associates and members  entry into new markets and growth of existing markets  niche market development  new product introduction  and investment in our infrastructure 
current economic conditions and recent developments 
during calendar year  the us and global economies slowed dramatically as a result of a variety of serious problems  including turmoil in the credit and financial markets  concerns regarding the stability and viability of major financial institutions  the state of the housing markets  high unemployment rates  and volatility in worldwide stock markets 
harsh economic conditions significantly reduced consumers disposable income and impacted our customers spending practices  causing a decline in our revenues in the second half of in addition  during and  we were subjected to certain negative publicity resulting from heightened litigation and regulatory activities 
see note litigation to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of such legal proceedings 
the global financial crisis  combined with the steep decline in customer demand and uncertainties associated with the potential outcome of outstanding litigation  have intensified our need to accelerate cost cutting measures and has forced us to reevaluate certain business priorities 
during and early  we implemented various initiatives to reduce expenses while staying committed to our strategic plan of developing new  innovative science based products  strengthening financial results  reduction in expenses  and adding value to our shareholders and independent associates 
in august  our board of directors reduced the amount of our quarterly cash dividend to per common share in response to lower sales and instability in the capital markets 
the decrease represents a reduction of per share from the dividend paid in the first and second quarters of with  shares outstanding as of december   this reduction allowed us to save approximately million in dividend distributions 
strong liquidity is an important factor in our on going efforts to weather the current economic downturn and we believe this initiative has made an important contribution 
see risk factors we are not required to pay dividends  and our board of directors could decide not to declare a dividend or could reduce the amount of the dividend at any time in item a of this form k for further discussion related to future payment of dividends 
the uncertainty associated with the current macro economic conditions led us to take steps to improve our operating cost structure 
in july  we eliminated approximately employees  or of our us workforce in an effort to reduce expenses and improve profitability 
in addition  in january  we eliminated over permanent and contract positions 
we anticipate roughly million in annual future savings associated with these reductions 
depending on the severity and length of the financial crisis and its impact on our business  it may be prudent to take similar actions in the future 
we also continue to eliminate non essential costs and have postponed certain projects and international expansion plans in the near term 
we continue to focus on new product development 
in  we introduced two new products in selected markets 
in march  we launched the bounce back capsules  an all natural product that supports recovery after physical activity or over exertion 
in september  we launched our osolean powder  a new fat loss product 
the osolean whey protein supplement is an all natural powder product that mixes with a variety of food and beverages allowing consumers to easily add it to any weight management and fitness program 
in order to reward our independent associates for their business building successes  we modified our global associate career and compensation plan by increasing opportunities for certain qualified independent associates to earn additional bonuses  including matching bonuses for enrollers 
these changes became effective for all countries by the end of the second quarter of in addition  in march  we launched a new global sales platform in the united states designed to assist our independent associates in their business building efforts 
we remain committed to adding value to our independent associates 
in january  we announced a new  simplified offering  which features a premium all star pack 
this premium all star pack provides income opportunities for business builders seeking a second income stream along with our leading wellness products 
developed in response to the current economic crisis  this more affordable pack includes more than of products including our new fat loss product osolean powder 
the enhanced compensation plan allows independent sales associates to start their business building opportunity in the wellness industry at a lower cost while providing faster access to leadership qualification 
during  several of our core products were certified by nsf international  an independent  accredited testing laboratory 
to date  we have received certifications from nsf for phytomatrix caplets  plus caplets  ambrotose ao capsules  advanced ambrotose  ambrotose complex  and optimal support packets 
the products were certified according to the nsf ansi dietary supplement standard  the only us national standard for dietary supplements 
we strive to ensure all of our products meet the strictest guidelines for purity  and these additional certifications from nsf exemplify our commitment to offering our customers the highest quality 
we intend to carry the nsf certification mark on the supplements labels and promotional materials to demonstrate compliance 
we will continue to seek nsf certification on our entire product line to demonstrate the ultimate value and quality when purchasing and consuming mannatech products 
we continue to focus our efforts on increasing operational efficiency 
we have made certain changes to our management structure in to provide stronger foundation for growth and better align our organization with our long term goals 
we believe that efficiencies gained from the organization realignment will help us to improve cost controls and distinguish us in the marketplace by adding emphasis to brand management  associate recruitment  supply chain excellence  new product development  and international expansion 
we expect a turbulent economy for the foreseeable future and we have undertaken several actions to address this environment 
we believe our aggressive cost reduction actions and financial discipline will enable us to effectively manage through the challenging economy 
we believe recent changes to our business model will position us to support future long term profitable growth

consolidated net sales for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in expanding our business to south africa in the second quarter of accounted for net sales of million 
operations in japan continue to grow as seen by a million increase in net sales for as compared to these increases were offset by a decrease in north america and international net sales of million and million  respectively  as compared to this decrease in net sales is a result of independent associate and member concerns about certain negative publicity as well as a weakened economy 
overall  the appreciation depreciation of foreign currencies during had approximately a million favorable impact on net sales in  with a favorable first half impact essentially offset by unfavorable second half results 
our total sales and sales mix can be influenced by any of the following changes in our sales prices  changes in consumer demand  changes in competitors products  changes in economic conditions  changes in regulations  announcements of new scientific studies and breakthroughs  introduction of new products  discontinuation of existing products  adverse publicity  and changes in our commissions and incentives programs 
our sales mix for the years ended december  was as follows change dollar percentage in millions  except percentages product sales pack sales other  including freight total net sales in april  we began operating our new erp system  which allowed us to separately quantify deferred revenue associated with sales of packs and products that were shipped but not yet received by customers 
as a result  in april  we began recording deferred revenue related to packs with pack sales and deferred revenue associated with products with product sales 
for the three months ended march   other sales included million related to the change in deferred revenue for packs and products shipped but not yet received by customers  rather than in the applicable pack or product sales category 
the decrease in our consolidated net sales consisted of a decrease in the volume of products and packs sold and a change in the mix of packs and products sold 
pack sales generally correlate to the number of new independent associates and members who purchase starter packs as well as the number of continuing independent associates who purchase upgrade or renewal packs 
however  there is not a direct correlation between the number of new and continuing independent associates and members purchasing packs and the amount of product sales because independent associates and members may consume different products at different consumption levels 
product sales for the year ended december   product sales decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the same period in the million decrease in product sales was comprised of a decrease in existing product sales of million and a decrease attributable to the million cost of introducing the new products set forth below 
we believe the decrease in product sales was primarily related to the economic downturn and independent associate and member concerns over certain negative publicity and litigation 
the following new products were introduced during mannatech optimal skin care system products in certain international markets  a new sales kit in the united states  phytomatrix caplets in japan  taiwan  united kingdom  denmark  germany  and south korea  bounce back capsules in north america  australia  and new zealand  osolean powder in north america  australia  new zealand  japan  and korea  heartsmart tablets in taiwan  various optimal health products in singapore  and various optimal health and optimal weight and fitness products in south africa 
pack sales we sell packs to our independent associates  which entitles them to purchase our products at wholesale prices 
members can also purchase packs  which enables them to purchase our products at a discount from published retail prices 
depending on the type of pack purchased  a pack may include certain products  promotional and educational information  and policies and procedures 
independent associates can also purchase upgrade packs  entitling the independent associate to additional promotional materials and additional commissions and incentives 
our business building associates purchase annual renewal packs 
the number of new and continuing independent associates and members  who purchased our packs during the years ended december  were as follows new continuing total for the year ended december   the overall number of independent associates and members decreased by  or  to  as compared to  for we experienced a decrease in the number of upgrade and renewal packs purchased by our continuing independent associates and a decrease in the number of new independent associates and members purchasing starter packs as compared to the same period in we believe the decrease in upgrade and renewal packs and starter packs purchased was related to the current economic conditions and independent associate and member concerns over certain negative publicity resulting from ongoing litigation 
in  we took the following actions to help increase the number of independent associates and members registered our most popular products with the appropriate regulatory agencies in all countries of operations  focused on new product development  launched a new  aggressive marketing and educational campaign  explored and entered new international markets  strengthened compliance initiatives  initiated additional incentives  explored new advertising and educational tools to broaden name recognition  implemented changes to our global associate career and compensation plan  introduced new products  and introduced a premium allstar pack in the us  canada and south africa in january pack sales associated with the number of independent associates and members can be further analyzed as follows  for the years ended december number of independent associates and members pack sales number of independent associates and members pack sales percentage and dollar change of pack sales in millions except percentages and independent associate information new continuing total for the year ended december   our total pack sales decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease in total pack sales was composed of an million decrease due to a decline in the number of new independent associates and members purchasing starter packs and a decrease of million due to a decline in the number of business building independent associates purchasing renewal and upgrade packs 
other sales other sales consisted of the following freight revenue charged to our independent associates and members  sales of promotional materials  training and event registration fees  monthly fees collected for success tracker  a customized electronic business building and educational materials database for our independent associates that helps stimulate product sales and provide business management  a reserve for estimated sales refunds and returns  and through march   deferred revenue that pertains to the timing of recognition of revenue for pack and product shipments 
for the year ended december   other sales decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in product and pack shipments  which more than offset the increase in freight charged per shipment 
the decrease in other sales is also related to the classification of deferred revenue of million for pack and product sales  which was partially offset by an increase in income related to a transactional tax holiday for certain sales occurring in gross profit for the year ended december   gross profit decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net sales  which correlates to the decrease in cost of sales  decrease in commissions  and decrease in incentives as compared to the same period in for the year ended december   gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to as compared to for the same period in cost of sales decreased during the year ended december  by  or million to million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decline in product cost of million 
the inventory write offs and adjustments decreased by million primarily due to the complimentary products shipped in as a result of the recall of the north american optimal restoring serum 
a decrease in freight cost was slightly offset by an increase in shipping supplies  which generated a net decrease of million as compared to the same period in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to as compared to for the same period in commission costs decreased for the year ended december   by  or million  to million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease in commissions was primarily related to the decrease in commissionable net sales

these compensation related costs were offset by a decrease in temporary and contract labor of approximately million  as well as a decrease in stock option expense of million  all of which were due to the conversion of a number of temporary and contract labor positions to permanent employees  normal merit increases  decreased capitalization of salaries for the development of our new enterprise resource planning system  and costs related to staff reduction 
this net increase was offset by a decrease in freight costs of million due to a decrease in product and pack shipments  and a decrease in marketing costs of million  which related to a change in distribution of an internal publication to associates  a reduction in cost related to corporate sponsored events  and a reduction in the cost associated with advertising materials and printing 
other operating costs other operating costs generally include travel  accounting legal consulting fees  royalties  credit card processing fees  banking fees  off site storage fees  utilities  and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
generally  changes in other operating costs are associated with the changes in our net sales 
for the year ended december   other operating costs decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in for the year ended december   other operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased to compared to for the same period in the decrease in other operating costs was primarily due to a million decrease in general office expenses 
there was also a million decrease in travel cost  a million decrease in credit card fees and royalties  and a decrease in r d costs 
these reductions in other operating costs were partially offset by a million increase in legal fees related to ongoing lawsuits  a increase in accounting and consulting fees related to global expansion activities and the write off of capitalized consulting fees associated with a sales software project  and a million increase in repairs and maintenance costs 
included in legal costs in the fourth quarter of is a million reversal of the estimated legal costs accrual related to the preliminary settlement of the texas attorney general complaint

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes include current and deferred income taxes for both our domestic and foreign operations 
our statutory income tax rates by jurisdiction are as follows  for the years ended december country australia canada japan republic of korea south africa n a switzerland n a taiwan united kingdom united states income from our international operations is subject to taxation in the countries in which we operate 
although we may receive foreign income tax credits that would reduce the total amount of income taxes owed in the united states  we may not be able to fully utilize our foreign income tax credits in the united states 
we use the recognition and measurement provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas  to account for income taxes 
the provisions of fas require a company to record a valuation allowance when the more likely than not criterion for realizing net deferred tax assets cannot be met 
furthermore  the weight given to the potential effect of such evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
as a result  we reviewed the operating results  as well as all of the positive and negative evidence related to realization of such deferred tax assets to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in each tax jurisdiction 
as of december  and  we maintained our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in taiwan totaling million and million  respectively  as we believe the more likely than not criterion for recognition and realization purposes  as defined in fas  cannot be met 
the dollar amount of the provisions for income taxes is directly related to our profitability and changes in taxable income among countries 
for the year ended december   our effective income tax rate decreased to from for the same period in for  the company s effective income tax rate was lower than what would be expected if the federal statutory income tax rate were applied to income before taxes primarily because of favorable differences from foreign operations 
for  the company s effective income tax rate was higher than what would be expected if the federal statutory income tax rate were applied to income before taxes primarily because of unfavorable permanent items from foreign operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the tables below summarize our consolidated operating results in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  and change total dollars of net sales total dollars of net sales dollar percentage in thousands  except percentages net sales cost of sales commissions and incentives gross profit operating expenses selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization other operating costs total operating expenses income from operations interest income other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss for geographical purposes  consolidated net sales primarily shipped to customers by location for the years ended december  and were as follows net sales in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales in millions  except percentages united states republic of korea japan australia canada new zealand united kingdom taiwan germany denmark totals net sales for the year ended december   our operations outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales  whereas in the same period in  our operations outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
consolidated net sales for the year ended december   increased by million or as compared to the same period in international sales have experienced growth  which generated million in incremental net sales for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the international sales growth in was largely associated with greater sales volume in korea  taiwan  japan  and germany driven by the continued growth of our phytomatrix caplets and mannatech optimal skin care system sales  introduced in japan and other asian countries in  as well as the introduction of advanced ambrotose products in japan in however  net sales for the year ended december   for canada  australia  new zealand  denmark  and the united kingdom decreased slightly compared to the same period in the overall increase in international net sales was offset by a decrease in domestic sales  which we believe was affected by independent associate and member concerns related to certain negative publicity from litigation and regulatory activities  and delays in processing orders caused by implementation issues in our erp system 
the decline in domestic sales was partially offset by the introduction of our mannatech optimal skin care system products and optimal support packets into north america in late march overall  the appreciation of foreign currencies had approximately a million favorable impact on net sales in our total sales and sales mix can be influenced by any of the following changes in our sales prices  changes in consumer demand  changes in competitors products  changes in economic conditions  changes in regulations  announcements of new scientific studies and breakthroughs  introduction of new products  discontinuation of existing products  adverse publicity  and changes in our commissions and incentives programs 
our sales mix for the years ended december  was as follows change dollar percentage in millions  except percentages product sales pack sales other  including freight total net sales in april  we began operating our new erp system  which allowed us to separately quantify deferred revenue associated with sales of packs and products that were shipped but not yet received by customers 
as a result  in april  we began recording deferred revenue related to packs with pack sales and deferred revenue associated with products with product sales 
for the three months ended march  and for the year ended december   we recorded deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  related to packs and products shipped but not yet received by customers in other sales rather than in the applicable pack or product sales category because our previous computer system could not separately differentiate deferred revenue associated with packs and products 
the increase in our consolidated net sales consisted of a change in the mix of packs and products sold 
pack sales generally correlate to the number of new independent associates and members who purchase a starter pack and with the number of continuing independent associates who purchase upgrade or renewal packs 
however  there is not a direct correlation between the number of new and continuing independent associates and members purchasing packs and the amount of product sales because independent associates and members may consume different products at different consumption levels 
product sales for the year ended december   product sales grew million  or  as compared to the same period in of the million increase in product sales  million of the increase was attributable to the introduction of new products 
the increase was offset by a decrease in existing product sales of million and deferred revenue of million  which was previously recorded in other sales 
we believe existing product sales decreased primarily due to independent associate and member concerns over certain negative publicity and litigation and regulatory activities and the delays in order processing due to the implementation of our erp system 
the following new products were introduced during mannatech optimal skin care system products in north america and australia  optimal support packets in north america  advanced ambrotose capsules in international markets  and phytomatrix capsules in australia and new zealand 
pack sales we sell packs to our independent associates  which entitles them to purchase our products at wholesale prices 
members can also purchase a pack  which entitles them to purchase our products at a discount from published retail prices 
depending on the type of pack purchased  a pack may include certain products  promotional and educational information  and policies and procedures 
independent associates can also purchase upgrade packs  entitling the independent associate to additional promotional materials and additional commissions and incentives 
our business building associates purchase annual renewal packs 
the number of new and continuing independent associates and members  who purchased our packs during the years ended december  were as follows new continuing total for the year ended december   the overall number of independent associates and members increased by  or  as compared to beginning in the second quarter of  we recorded pack sale related deferred revenue with pack sales  instead of with other sales  which decreased the pack sales presented for we have continued to experience an increase in the number of continuing independent associates who purchase our upgrade and renewal packs 
however  we experienced a decrease in the number of new independent associates and members purchasing starter packs as compared to the same period in we believe the decrease in new independent associates and members purchasing starter packs may relate to certain negative publicity  customer difficulty adapting to our new erp system  changes to our corporate website and independent associate and member concerns resulting from ongoing litigation and regulatory activities 
additional actions we took in to help increase the number of independent associates and members were registered our most popular products in all countries of operations  focused on new product development  explored new international markets  launched an aggressive marketing and educational campaign  expanded our annual travel incentive for one additional business period  instituted a satisfaction guarantee program  strengthened compliance initiatives  concentrated on publishing results of research studies and clinical trials related to our products  initiated additional incentives  and explored new advertising and educational tools to broaden name recognition 
pack sales associated with the number of independent associates and members can be further analyzed as follows  for the years ended december number of independent associates and members pack sales number of independent associates and members pack sales percentage and dollar change of pack sales in millions except percentages and independent associate information new continuing total for the year ended december   our total pack sales decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease in total pack sales was composed of an million decrease related to a decrease in the number of new independent associates and members purchasing starter packs 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million related to an increase in the number of business building independent associates purchasing renewal and upgrade packs 
other sales other sales consisted of the following freight revenue charged to our independent associates and members  sales of promotional materials  training and event registration fees  monthly fees collected for success tracker  a customized electronic business building and educational materials database for our independent associates that helps stimulate product sales and provide business management  a reserve for estimated sales refunds and returns  and through march   deferred revenue that pertains to the timing of recognition of revenue for pack and product shipments 
for the year ended december   other sales decreased by million to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to a decrease in freight revenue of million and an increase in costs related to sales refunds of million 
freight revenue decreased due to the change in the sales mix between countries in which freight is charged to customers and those in which it is not 
the increase in costs related to sales refunds was due to a product recall in  issues with shipments during the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system  and a change in our sales return policy 
gross profit for the year ended december   gross profit decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in for the year ended december   gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to as compared to for the same period in the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a increase in costs of sales and a increase in commissions and incentives  which was partially offset by a increase in net sales 
cost of sales increased during the year ended december   by  or million  to million as compared to million for the same period in the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to an increase in inventory write offs and adjustments of million  an increase in freight and other costs of million  offset by a decrease in the costs of finished goods of million 
the inventory write offs and adjustments were for skin care  shrinkage in certain raw materials  and an increase in complimentary products shipped in connection with the recall of the north american optimal restoring serum  and issues with shipments during the implementation of our erp system 
the increase in freight and other costs was due to increases in shipping rates and an increase in shipments to foreign countries  due to the change in sales among countries 
the decrease in the costs of finished goods was due to changes in the sales mix between packs and products 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to from  which primarily related to the change in the mix of packs and products sold  increased freight costs  and an increase in inventory write offs 
commission costs increased for the year ended december   by  or million  to million as compared to million for the same period in the increase in commissions primarily related to the increase in commissionable net sales 
for the year ended december   commissions as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat at as compared to for the same period of incentive costs increased for the year ended december   by  or million  to million as compared to million for the same period in the costs of incentives  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in the increase was the result of an increase in the number of independent associates who qualified for annual travel incentives  which increased in by to  as compared to  in the increase is also related to the increase in the number of independent associates in international countries who qualified for an annual travel incentive  as the international travel incentives are more expensive per person than domestic travel incentives 
additionally  new international incentives and contests were added during the year ended december   resulting in an increase in incentive costs 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses include a combination of both fixed and variable expenses 
these expenses consist of compensation and benefits for employees  temporary and contract labor  outbound shipping and freight  and marketing related expenses  such as monthly magazine development costs and costs related to hosting our corporate sponsored events 
for the year ended december   selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december   increased to  as compared to for the same period in the increase in selling and administrative expenses consists primarily of the following a net increase of million in compensation and compensation related costs  which included an increase in payroll and payroll related costs of approximately million  an increase in temporary and contract labor of approximately million  and an increase in stock option expense of million  all of which were due to an increase in staffing levels  normal merit increases  and decreased capitalization of salaries for the erp system  and an increase of approximately million in marketing and marketing related expenses due to marketing costs associated with new product introductions  an increase in magazine costs  and costs associated with increased attendance at our corporate sponsored events 
other operating costs other operating costs generally include travel  accounting legal consulting fees  royalties  credit card processing fees  banking fees  off site storage fees  utilities  and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
generally  changes in other operating costs are associated with the changes in our net sales 
for the year ended december   other operating costs increased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in for the year ended december   other operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased to compared to for the same period in the increase in other operating costs was primarily due to a million increase in accounting  legal  and consulting fees  a million increase in various repairs and maintenance costs including purchases of noncapitalizable equipment  a million increase in credit card fees  and a million increase in bad debt expenses 
accounting  legal  and consulting fees increased by million as compared to the same period in  primarily due to legal fees and litigation costs associated with ongoing lawsuits and regulatory matters of approximately million and accounting fees associated with tax related services of million 
the remaining increase of million is the additional consulting fees associated with our new erp system  global associate training  and global expansion activities 
credit card processing fees increased by million as compared to the same period in due to an increase in international net sales  especially in south korea 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased by  or million  to million as compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of net sales  depreciation and amortization expense increased to from for the same period in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to placing into service our erp system  which cost approximately million and is being amortized over years 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes include current and deferred income taxes for both our domestic and foreign operations 
our statutory income tax rates by jurisdiction are as follows  for the years ended december country united states australia united kingdom japan republic of korea taiwan income from our international operations is subject to taxation in the countries in which we operate 
although we may receive foreign income tax credits that would reduce the total amount of income taxes owed in the united states  we may not be able to fully utilize our foreign income tax credits in the united states 
we use the recognition and measurement provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas  to account for income taxes 
the provisions of fas require a company to record a valuation allowance when the more likely than not criterion for realizing net deferred tax assets cannot be met 
furthermore  the weight given to the potential effect of such evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
as a result  we reviewed the operating results  as well as all of the positive and negative evidence related to realization of such deferred tax assets to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in each tax jurisdiction 
as of december  and  we maintained our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in taiwan totaling million and million  respectively  as we believe the more likely than not criterion for recognition and realization purposes  as defined in fas  cannot be met 
the republic of korea deferred tax assets carrying a valuation allowance of million at december   were fully utilized in the dollar amount of the provisions for income taxes is directly impacted by our profitability and changes in taxable income among countries 
for the year ended december   our effective income tax rate increased to from for the same period in for  the company s effective income tax rate was higher than what would be expected if the federal statutory income tax rate were applied to income before taxes primarily because of unfavorable permanent items from foreign operations 
the tax rate difference for was primarily due to filing for research and experimentation income tax credits totaling million for through activities 
seasonality we believe the impact of seasonality on our consolidated results of operations is minimal 
we have experienced and believe we will continue to experience variations on our quarterly results of operations in response to  among other things the timing of the introduction of new products and incentives  our ability to attract and retain associates and members  the timing of our incentives and contests  the general overall economic outlook  government regulations  the outcome of certain lawsuits  the perception and acceptance of network marketing  and the consumer perception of our products and overall operations 
as a result of these and other factors  our quarterly results may vary significantly in the future 
period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance since we can give no assurances that revenue trends in new markets  as well as in existing markets  will follow our historical patterns 
the market price of our common stock may also be adversely affected by the above factors 
liquidity and capital resources our principal use of cash is to pay for operating expenses  including commissions and incentives  capital assets  inventory purchases  and international expansion and to pay quarterly cash dividends 
we generally fund our business objectives  operations  and expansion of our operations through net cash flows from operations rather than incurring long term debt 
we plan to continue to fund our needs through net cash flows from operations 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents that can be used  along with normal cash flows from operations  to fund any unanticipated shortfalls in future cash flows 
cash and cash equivalents and investments as of december   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by  or million  to million from million as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is related to the current period loss  adjusted for noncash items  the acquisition of additional inventory  purchases of property and equipment  the decrease in accrued expenses due to the timing of payments  the decrease in taxes payable due to our net tax benefit position  and the payment of dividends  which was offset by conversion of our long term investments to cash and cash equivalents in and the favorable impact of foreign currency on our cash balances  primarily in korea 
as of december   our investments have all been converted to cash equivalents as compared to an investment balance of million as of december  working capital working capital represents total current assets less total current liabilities 
at december   our working capital increased by million  or  to million from million at december  the increase in working capital primarily relates to a decrease in accrued expenses and taxes payable and an increase in inventory  partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash flows our net consolidated cash flows consist of the following  for the years ended december provided by used in in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities the operating  investing  and financing activities are described in more detail below 
operating activities for the years ended december    and  our net operating activities used cash of million and provided cash of million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december    and  net earnings adjusted for noncash activities used cash of million and provided cash of million and million  respectively  and our working capital accounts used cash of million  provided cash of million  and used cash of million  respectively 
we expect that our net operating cash flows in will be sufficient to fund our current operations and future quarterly cash dividends 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels  or will continue to declare and pay dividends 
certain events  such as an unfavorable outcome against us with respect to current litigation  could impact our available cash or our ability to generate cash flows from operations 
see risk factors we are not required to pay dividends  and our board of directors could decide not to declare a dividend or could reduce the amount of the dividend at any time in item a of this form k for further discussion related to future payment of dividends 
investing activities for the years ended december    and  our net investing activities provided cash of million and used cash of million and million  respectively 
in  we converted our long term investments to cash and cash equivalents  providing cash of million  which was partially offset by the acquisition of capital assets of million 
in  we used cash of million to purchase capital assets and million as collateral for credit card payments in the republic of korea  which was partially offset by sales of investments of million 
in  we used cash of million to purchase capital assets  million to purchase investments  and million as collateral for credit card payments in the republic of korea  which was partially offset by releasing million of restricted cash to operations related to the expiration of a letter of credit for our travel incentive 
in  we anticipate using cash of up to million to purchase other capital assets for use in our operations  expansion of our corporate facilities and planned international expansion 
in  we anticipate using cash up to approximately million for litigation settlement payments 
financing activities in  we used cash of million to fund our net financing activities 
during  we used cash of million to fund payment of quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders and used cash of million to repay capital leases 
in  we used cash of million to fund our net financing activities 
during  we used cash of million to fund payment of quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders and used cash of million to repay capital leases 
these uses of cash were partially offset by receiving cash of million and recording an income tax benefit of million related to option holders exercising their stock options 
in  we used cash of million to fund our net financing activities 
during  we used cash of million to pay quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders  used cash of million to purchase our common stock in the open market  and used cash of million to repay capital leases 
these uses of cash were partially offset by receiving cash of million and recording an income tax benefit of million related to option holders exercising their stock options 
general liquidity and cash flows historically  we generate positive cash flows from operations and believe our existing liquidity and cash flows from operations are adequate to fund our normal expected future business operations  our estimated payments of cash dividends  the repurchase of our common stock in the open market  and international expansion costs for the next to months 
however  if our existing capital resources or cash flows become insufficient to meet current business plans  projections  and existing capital requirements  we will be required to modify our payment of future dividends and raise additional funds  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
see risk factors we are not required to pay dividends  and our board of directors could decide not to declare a dividend or could reduce the amount of the dividend at any time in item a of this form k for further discussion related to future payment of dividends 
contractual obligations 
the following summarizes our future commitments and obligations associated with various agreements and contracts as of december   for the years ending december thereafter total in thousands capital lease obligations purchase obligations operating leases post employment royalty employment agreements total commitments and obligations we have maintained purchase commitments with certain raw material suppliers to purchase minimum quantities and to ensure exclusivity of our raw materials and proprietorship of our products 
currently  we have four supply agreements that require minimum purchase commitments 
we expect to exceed our minimum monthly required purchase commitments 
we also maintain other supply agreements and manufacturing agreements to protect our products  regulate product costs  and help ensure quality control standards 
these agreements do not require us to purchase any set minimums 
we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to acquisitions or purchases of any manufacturing facilities  however  management from time to time explores the possibility of the benefits of purchasing a raw material manufacturing facility to help control costs of our raw materials and help ensure quality control standards 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entity arrangements  nor do we have any off balance sheet arrangements 
market risks please see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk under item a of this form k for additional information about our market risks 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use estimates throughout our financial statements  which are influenced by management s judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates are based on historical trends  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are applicable and reasonable under the circumstances at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our audit committee reviews our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we continually evaluate and review our policies related to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations that require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we also analyze the need for certain estimates  including the need for such items as allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  long lived fixed assets and capitalization of internal use software development costs  reserve for uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances  revenue recognition  sales returns  and deferred revenues  accounting for stock based compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
historically  actual results have not materially deviated from our estimates 
however  we caution readers that actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if circumstances change relating to the various assumptions or conditions used in our estimates  we could experience an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have identified the following applicable critical accounting policies and estimates as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consists of receivables from manufacturers  independent associates  and members and are carried at their estimated collectible amounts 
as of december   net accounts receivable totaled million 
we simultaneously receive payment for an order when the order ships 
if the payment is rejected or if it does not match the order total  a receivable is created 
we periodically review receivables for realizability and base collectability upon assumptions  historical trends  and recent account activities 
if our estimates regarding estimated collectability are inaccurate or consumer trends change in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional write offs or bad debts 
as of december   we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of less than million 
inventory reserves inventory consists of raw materials  work in progress  finished goods  and promotional materials that are stated at the lower of cost using standard costs that approximate average costs or market 
we record the amounts charged by the vendors as the costs of inventory 
typically  the net realizable value of our inventory is higher than the aggregate cost 
determination of net realizable value can be complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of net realizable value  the following items are considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer demand  regulatory changes  competitive pricing  and performance of similar products 
if we determine the carrying value of inventory is in excess of estimated net realizable value  we write down the value of inventory to the estimated net realizable value 
we also review inventory for obsolescence in a similar manner and any inventory identified as obsolete is reserved or written off 
our determination of obsolescence is based on assumptions about the demand for our products  product expiration dates  estimated future sales  and general future plans 
we monitor actual sales compared to original projections  and if actual sales are less favorable than those originally projected by us  we record an additional inventory reserve or write down 
historically  our estimates have been close to our actual reported amounts 
however  if our estimates regarding fair market value or obsolescence are inaccurate or consumer demand for our products changes in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional material losses or gains in excess of our established estimated inventory reserves 
at december  and  our inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
long lived fixed assets and capitalization of software development costs in addition to capitalizing long lived fixed asset costs  we also capitalize costs associated with internally developed software projects collectively fixed assets and amortize such costs over the estimated useful lives of such fixed assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation computed using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the improvements 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
if a fixed asset is sold or otherwise retired or disposed of  the cost of the fixed asset and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is written off and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in other operating costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
we review our fixed assets for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable  such as plans to dispose of an asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
our impairment review includes a comparison of future projected cash flows generated by the asset  or group of assets  with its associated net carrying value 
if the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
the fair value is determined by calculating the discounted expected future cash flows using an estimated risk free rate of interest 
any identified impairment losses are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the fixed asset is adjusted to the new carrying value and any subsequent increases in fair value of the fixed asset are not recorded 
in addition  if we determine the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be reduced from our original estimate  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively  based on the new remaining useful life of the fixed asset 
the impairment calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives  and discount rates 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge  which could be material to our results of operations 
in addition  if accounting standards change  or if fixed assets become obsolete  we may be required to write off any unamortized costs of fixed assets  or if estimated useful lives change  we would be required to accelerate depreciation or amortization periods and recognize additional depreciation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
historically  our estimates and assumptions related to the carrying value and the estimated useful lives of our fixed assets have not materially deviated from actual results 
as of december   the estimated useful lives and net carrying values of fixed assets are as follows estimated useful life net carrying value at december  office furniture and equipment to years million computer hardware and software to years million automobiles to years million leasehold improvements to years million construction in progress to years million total net carrying value at december  million we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful estimated life of the leased asset or the lease term 
construction in process includes fixed assets  leasehold improvements and internally developed software costs 
once placed in service  leasehold improvements will be amortized over the shorter of an asset s useful life or the remaining lease term 
once the internally developed software is placed in service  it will be amortized over three to five years 
the net carrying costs of fixed assets and construction in progress are exposed to impairment losses if our assumptions and estimates of their carrying values change  there is a change in estimated future cash flow  or there is a change in the estimated useful life of the fixed asset 
uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances as of december   we recorded million in taxes payable and million in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to uncertain income tax positions 
as required by fin  we use judgments and make estimates and assumptions related to evaluating the probability of uncertain income tax positions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the potential liability related to an assessment of whether the income tax position will more likely than not be sustained in an income tax audit 
we are also subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
as part of our evaluation of these tax issues  we establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years 
therefore  our estimated reserve balances and liability related to uncertain income tax positions may exist for multiple years before the applicable statute of limitations expires or before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
we believe our tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions are based upon reasonable judgment and estimates  however  if actual results materially differ  our effective income tax rate and cash flows could be affected in the period of discovery or resolution 
we also review the estimates and assumptions used in evaluating the probability of realizing the future benefits of our deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance when we believe that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
if we are unable to realize the expected future benefits of our deferred tax assets  we are required to provide a valuation allowance 
we use our past history and experience  overall profitability  future management plans  and current economic information to evaluate the amount of valuation allowance to record 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising from our operations in taiwan because they did not meet the more likely than not criteria as defined by the recognition and measurement provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in addition  as of december   we had deferred tax assets  after valuation allowance  totaling million  which may not be realized if our assumptions and estimates change  which would affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in the period of discovery or resolution 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue we derive revenues from sales of our products  sales of our starter and renewal packs  and shipping fees 
substantially all of our product and pack sales are made to independent associates at published wholesale prices 
we also sell products to independent members at discounted published retail prices 
we record revenue net of any sales taxes 
total deferred revenue consists of i revenue received from sales of packs and products shipped but not received by the customers at period end  ii revenue received for a one year magazine subscription  iii revenue received from pack sales when the pack sale price exceeds the wholesale value of all individual components within the pack  and iv revenue received from prepaid registration fees from customers planning to attend a future corporate sponsored event 
we recognize deferred revenue from shipped packs and products upon receipt by the customer 
we recognize deferred revenue related to future corporate sponsored events when the event is held 
all other deferred revenue is recognized over one year 
at december   total deferred revenue was million 
significant changes in the pricing structure of our packs or our shipping methods could result in additional revenue deferrals or cause us to recognize deferred revenue over a longer period of time 
for example  if we were to decrease the number of items included in our packs while keeping the sales price of the packs the same  we would have to defer additional revenue and recognize the additional deferred revenue over one year 
we have three different product return policies i a policy for our retail customers  ii a policy for our independent members  and iii a policy for our independent associates 
retail customers may return any of our products  within days of purchase  to the original independent associate who sold the product  and such associate is required to provide the retail customer with a full cash refund 
the independent associate may receive a replacement product by forwarding proof of the refund to us 
independent members may return an order to us within days of the purchase date without membership termination or restocking fees 
after days from the date of purchase  the independent member may not receive a refund and is allowed an exchange only  and may  if abuse of the return policy is found  have his or her membership terminated 
independent associates are allowed to return an order within one year of the purchase date upon terminating their associate accounts 
if an independent associate returns a product unopened and in good salable condition  the independent associate returning the product may receive a full refund 
we may also allow an independent associate to receive a full refund for the first days following a product s purchase 
after days from the purchase date  an independent associate may not request a refund  and is allowed an exchange only  however  if abuse of the return policy is found  an independent associate may be terminated 
historically  sales returns estimates have not materially deviated from actual sales returns 
based upon our return policies  we estimate a sales return reserve for expected sales refunds based on our historical experience over a rolling six month period 
if actual results differ from our estimated sales returns reserves due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded each period could be materially affected 
historically  our sales returns have not materially changed through the years as the majority of our customers who return their merchandise do so within the first days after the original sale 
sales returns have averaged or less of our gross sales and for the year ended december  were composed of the following in thousands sales reserve as of december  current provision related to sales made in current provision related to sales made prior to actual returns or credits in related to actual returns or credits in related to prior periods sales reserve as of december  accounting for stock based compensation we grant stock options to our employees and board members 
at the date of grant  we determine the fair value of a stock option award and recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of such stock option award  which is two to four years 
the fair value of the stock option award is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  calculated fair value 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock option life  expected volatility  expected average risk free interest rates  and expected forfeiture rates 
for the year ended december   our assumptions and estimates used for the calculated fair value of stock options granted in were as follows january grant february grant march grant june grant june grant august grant november grant november grant november grant estimated fair value per share of options granted assumptions annualized dividend yield risk free rate of return common stock price volatility expected average life of stock options in years historically  our estimates and underlying assumptions have not materially deviated from our actual reported results and rates 
however  the assumptions we use are based on our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions we use  the stock based compensation expense reported in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of stock based compensation 
for example  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may be required to make an adjustment to our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
as of december   using our current assumptions and estimates  we anticipate recognizing million in gross compensation expense through related to unvested stock options outstanding 
if we grant additional stock options in the future  we would be required to recognize additional compensation expense over the vesting period of such stock options in our consolidated statement of operations 
gross compensation expense would equal the calculated fair value of such stock options  which is dependent on the assumptions used to calculate such fair value  but generally ranges between to of the exercise price multiplied by the number of stock options awarded 
as of december   we had  shares available for grant in the future 
contingencies and litigation each quarter  we evaluate the need to establish a reserve for any legal claims or assessments 
we base our evaluation on our best estimates of the potential liability in such matters 
the legal reserve includes an estimated amount for any damages and the probability of losing any threatened legal claims or assessments 
the legal reserve is developed in consultation with our general and outside counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although we believe that our legal reserves and accruals are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
if actual results differ  if circumstances change  or if we experience an unanticipated adverse outcome of any legal action  including any claim or assessment  we would be required to recognize the estimated amount that could reduce net income  earnings per share  and cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and do not purchase investments as hedges or for purposes other than trading that are likely to expose us to certain types of market risk  including interest rate  commodity price  or equity price risk 
although we have investments  we believe there has been no material change in our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have not issued any debt instruments  entered into any forward or futures contracts  purchased any options  or entered into any swap agreements 
we are exposed to other market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
because the change in value of the united states dollar measured against foreign currency may affect our consolidated financial results  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could positively or negatively affect our results as expressed in united states dollars 
for example  when the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies in which our products are sold or weakens against foreign currencies in which we may incur costs  our consolidated net sales and or related costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our consolidated operations or profitability 
we expanded into canada in  into australia in  into the united kingdom in  into japan in  into new zealand in  into the republic of korea in  into taiwan and denmark in  into germany in  and into south africa and singapore in our united states location processes orders for the united states  canada  and south africa 
the australian location process orders for australia  new zealand and singapore 
the united kingdom location processes orders for the united kingdom  denmark and germany 
we translate our revenues and expenses in foreign markets using either a current spot rate or average rate 
we maintain policies  procedures  and internal processes in an effort to help monitor any significant market risks and we do not use any financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we assess the anticipated foreign currency working capital requirements of our foreign operations and maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies sufficient to satisfy most of these anticipated requirements 
we caution that we cannot predict with any certainty our future exposure to such currency exchange rate fluctuations or the impact  if any  such fluctuations may have on our future business  product pricing  operating expenses  and on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  to combat such market risk  we closely monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
the foreign currencies in which we currently have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk include the currencies of canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  germany  south africa  and singapore 
the current spot rate  average currency exchange rates  and the low and high of such currency exchange rates as compared to the united states dollar  for each of these countries as of and for the year ended december  were as follows country foreign currency name low high average spot australia dollar canada dollar denmark krone germany euro japan yen new zealand dollar republic of korea won singapore dollar south africa rand switzerland franc taiwan dollar united kingdom british pound
