item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a includes the following sections executive overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business 
critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements 
results of operations that begins with an overview followed by a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses 
liquidity and capital resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows  changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments 
you should note that this md a discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see the section entitled risk factors  future operating results at the beginning of item a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 
you should read this md a in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii  item on november  we acquired mobile  inc which we renamed sybase for approximately million 
sybase delivers mobile data and messaging  premium content  and value added services for leading mobile operators  content providers  global brands  media companies  and financial institutions worldwide 
total revenues and operating income of sybase were million and million  respectively in total revenues and operating loss of sybase were million and million  respectively in december  total revenues and operating loss of mobile  were million and million  respectively for period from november  through december  
table of contents executive overview our business sybase is a global enterprise software and services company exclusively focused on managing and mobilizing information from the data center to the point of action 
we provide open  cross platform solutions that securely deliver information anytime  anywhere  providing decision ready information to the right people at the right time 
our value proposition involves enabling the unwired enterprise by allowing enterprises to extend their information securely and make it useful for people anywhere using any device 
we deliver a full range of solutions to ensure that customer information is securely managed and mobilized to the point of action  including enterprise and mobile databases  middleware  synchronization  encryption and device management software  and mobile messaging services 
during our business was organized into three business segments ipg  which principally focuses on enterprise class database servers  integration and development products  ias  which provides mobile database and mobile enterprise solutions  and sybase  which provides global services for mobile messaging interoperability and the management and distribution of mobile content 
for further discussion of our business segments  see note ten to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
our results we reported total revenues of  million for compared to  million for the increase in total revenues from to was attributable to increases in each of our revenue streams  with license revenues increasing percent  service revenue increasing percent and messaging revenues increasing percent 
our ipg segment saw a million percent increase in revenues  sybase grew revenues million percent and ias experienced a million percent increase in revenues 
the increase in ipg revenues was driven by a percent increase in license revenue and a percent increase in services revenues 
the growth in ipg license revenues was primarily attributed to a percent increase in database revenues  namely our iq and adaptive server enterprise products adaptive server enterprise ase and sybase iq products  while the increase in services revenues was primarily attributable to an percent increase in technical support services revenue 
the increase in ias revenues from to was driven by a percent increase in license revenue and a percent increase in services revenues 
the increase in license revenues was primarily attributed to a percent increase in revenues from our afaria device management product  while the increase in service revenue came from an increase in technical support services 
our ianywhere product platform continues to garner accolades for its market leadership from the likes of gartner and idc 
currently  sybase is the only vendor to be rated as a leader in three enterprise mobility categories multi access gateways  enterprise mobile email  and mobile device management security 
we have also been a long time leader in the mobile and embedded database market 
we believe that as a market leader  we are positioned to benefit from growth in the enterprise mobility market 
sybase revenues were driven by a percent increase in messaging revenue spurred by strong growth in both europe and the united states 
our sybase segment continued to see strong growth in messaging volume and greater adoption of messaging as an effective means for enterprises to reach their customers 
we believe continued growth in messaging traffic and the adoption of messaging by the enterprise will offset continued pricing compression and lead to growth in our messaging revenues 

table of contents we reported net income of million for  compared to million our operating income was million percent operating margin compared to million percent operating margin in the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the ipg segment s million increase in operating income representing both their revenue growth and operating margin expansion 
net income decreased year over year due to a charge of million in to write down the value of certain auction rate securities  and the absence of a million tax credit relating to the release of certain valuation allowances 
during  we generated a record amount of net cash from operating activities at million  a percent increase over the prior year 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days for the quarter ended december  compared to days for the quarter ended december  for a discussion of certain factors that may impact our business and financial results  see risk factors future operating results  above 
business trends our business activity and pipeline was strong throughout despite a deterioration in the macro economic environment 
entering  we are encouraged by the strength of our pipeline and the general condition of our business 
we believe  however  that the overall spending environment will be very challenging in  with the world economy mired in a recession and most analysts predicting a decline in overall it spending 
while our short term pipeline is strong  it is more difficult than in the past to predict the overall buying environment in the second half of the year 
additionally  in we expect that our year over year revenue and net margin comparisons will be adversely impacted by a significant strengthening of the us dollar against various foreign currencies  most specifically the euro and other european currencies 
we continue to see spending strength on mission critical applications and new capabilities like business analytics and risk management areas where our key products have been doing very well 
in contrast  we believe the spending environment for discretionary projects and solutions requiring long professional services engagements will continue to be poor during we have maintained a strong short term pipeline for enterprise infrastructure products used in mission critical applications  especially our adaptive server enterprise ase product  for which we added new customers during we also benefit from the continued proliferation of enterprise data with our customers showing willingness to invest resources on new analytic solutions 
we saw strong demand for our analytic solutions during with new customers for our iq analytic server iq product and new customers for our risk analytics platform rap product 
iq offers a highly optimized analytic engine specifically designed to deliver dramatically faster results for business intelligence  analytic and reporting solutions 
our rap product  which is built on iq  is targeted to the financial service industry for risk  trading and compliance analytics 
the pipeline for rap  which was launched in the first half of  continues to build and provides what we believe  will be a future growth engine for our iq product 
with respect to the market for mobility and integration products we believe these products continue to gain market acceptance and will provide us with growth opportunities in the future 
for we are supported by a strong product cycle with our refreshed ianywhere product platform and will be focused on expanding our relationships with system integrators and other partners 
with respect to the market for messaging services  we believe that our messaging business will see revenue driven by continuing growth in worldwide short messaging services sms and multimedia messaging services mms traffic levels and an expanding demand for mobile data roaming grx services 
additionally  we continue to see growth as enterprises  focus more of their business towards mobile messaging as an inexpensive means of interacting with their customers on a real time basis 
offsetting to some extent the growth in message volume has been continued price compression 
our plans for the future are focused on providing additional value added services such as hosted analytics 
table of contents and mobile commerce solutions which we believe will allow us to demonstrate service differentiation and provide us with the opportunity to expand financial performance for the messaging business 
in we will be aggressively maintaining cost controls to improve financial performance 
one area of focus will be to drive cost and revenue synergies between our operating segments as we eliminate research and development overlap  combine marketing efforts  integrate back office functions and streamline business operations 
with this focus we believe we can improve operating results and maintain our strong cash flow in an uncertain environment 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we also are required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to software and mobile messaging revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of investments without readily available markets and the classification of related impairments  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  income taxes  stock based compensation  purchase accounting  restructuring  and contingencies and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience  observable and unobservable inputs under the level sfas framework  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances 
our management has reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
further  changes in accounting and legal standards could adversely affect our future operating results see risk factors future operating results  above 
our critical accounting policies include software and mobile messaging revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  valuation of investments without readily available markets and classification of related impairments  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  income taxes  stock based compensation  purchase accounting  restructuring and contingencies and liabilities  each of which are discussed below 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software and message services companies are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue  although certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
these judgments would include  for example  the determination of a customer s creditworthiness  whether two separate transactions with a customer should be accounted for as a single transaction  reporting certain third party content delivery revenues net as an agent versus gross as a principal  or whether included software services are essential to the functionality of a product 

table of contents license and service revenues we recognize software revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts or sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements 
license fee revenues are recognized when a a non cancelable license agreement is in force  b the product has been delivered  c the license fee is fixed or determinable  and d collection is reasonably assured 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
residual method accounting 
in software arrangements that include multiple elements eg  license rights and technical support services  we allocate the total fees among each of the elements using the residual method of accounting 
under this method  revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements  and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such undelivered elements is based upon the price we charge for such product or service when it is sold separately 
we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes to our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such undelivered elements 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition associated with multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results 
percentage of completion accounting 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment of the licenses  provided i the criteria described in subparagraphs a through d above are met  ii payment of the license fee is not dependent upon performance of the consulting services  and iii the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or performance of services is a condition to payment of license fees  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we use labor hours to estimate the progress to completion 
under this method  we are required to estimate the number of total hours needed to complete a project  and revenues are recognized based on the percentage of total contract hours as they are completed while costs are recognized as incurred 
due to the complexity involved in the estimating process  revenues and profits recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting are subject to revision as contract phases are actually completed 
historically  these revisions have not been material 
sublicense revenues 
we recognize sublicense fees as reported to us by our licensees 
license fees for certain application development and data access tools are recognized upon direct shipment by us to the end user or upon direct shipment to the reseller for resale to the end user 
if collection is not reasonably assured in advance  revenue is recognized only when sublicense fees are actually collected and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
service revenues 
technical support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related support agreement  which in most cases is one year 
revenues from consulting services under time and materials contracts  and for education  are recognized as services are performed 
revenues from fixed price consulting agreements are generally recognized based on the proportional performance of the project  with performance measured based on hours of work performed 
message revenues we recognize message revenue in accordance with sab no 
 emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf and where applicable in accordance with eitf  no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
we recognize revenue when a there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the service has been provided to the customer  c the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable  and d the collection of the fees is reasonable assured 

table of contents we generate a significant portion of our message revenue from per message transaction fees and to a lesser extent  from fixed price messaging arrangements providing for the delivery of an unlimited number of messages for a specified period of time  and revenue share agreements related to the delivery of third party content 
we recognize revenue from transaction fees based upon the number of messages successfully processed by our platforms and delivered in accordance with the terms of our arrangements 
we recognize revenue from the fixed price messaging arrangements ratably over the period of time specified in the agreement 
in some instances third party content providers  and other enterprises enter into revenue sharing arrangements with us 
under a standard revenue sharing transaction we deliver content from a third party provider to the cell phone of a mobile operator s subscriber 
third party content includes  among others  ringtones  wallpapers  interactive games  competitions  directory inquiry services  and information services 
the subscriber is invoiced by their mobile operator  who upon receipt of payment  remits a portion of the charge to us 
upon payment from the mobile operator  we generally remit payment to the third party content provider 
in accordance with eitf  we have determined that we act as an agent under these revenue sharing arrangements and accordingly  record as revenue the net amount retained by us 
the net amount retained by us reflects the gross amount billed to the operator less amounts due to the content provider 
impairment of goodwill  non amortizable intangible assets and other purchased intangible assets goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets  such as tradenames  have generally resulted from our business combinations accounted for as purchases 
we are required to test amounts recorded as goodwill or other non amortizable intangible assets with indeterminate lives  at least annually for impairment 
the review of goodwill and indeterminate lived intangibles for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires us to make numerous estimates  using a discounted cash flow model  to determine the fair values of our reporting units to which goodwill is assigned 
for these purposes  our reporting units equate to our reported segments 
see note ten to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value  we are required to perform an analysis similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
this analysis requires a valuation of certain other purchased intangible assets with determinate and indeterminate useful lives including in process research and development  and developed technology 
we performed our annual impairment analysis for each of our historical operating units ipg  ias  and sy and for each indeterminate lived intangible asset as of december  this analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit or indeterminate lived intangible exceeded its carrying value 
therefore  we were not required to recognize an impairment loss in as of december   our goodwill balance totaled million and our other non amortizable purchased intangibles totaled million 
changes in our internal business structure  increases in the applicable discount rate  changes in our future revenue and expense forecasts  and certain other factors that directly impact the valuation of our reporting units could result in a future impairment charge 
we also continue to separately review our other purchased intangible assets eg  purchased technology  customer lists and covenants not to compete for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
for these purposes  recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing their carrying values to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
this methodology requires us to estimate future cash flows associated with certain assets or groups of assets 
changes in these estimates  technology obsolescence  customer terminations and other factors could result in impairment losses associated with other intangible assets 
in  we wrote off million of certain purchased technologies 
valuation  classification and impairments of investments 
table of contents on january  we adopted the fasb staff positions fas nos 
and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments the fsps 
the fsps were issued on november  and nullified certain provisions of eitf no 
related to evaluating an other than temporary impairment and clarified the accounting policies set forth in fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
on october  we adopted fsp no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
fsp is applicable to the valuation of auction rate securities held by the company for which there was no active market as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sfas management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date 
at december   we have classified short term bank deposits and long term cash investments as available for sale pursuant to sfas in addition  the company has classified million invested in mutual funds as directed by participants of a rabbi trust related to a deferred compensation plan as trading securities 
investments classified as available for sale are recorded at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses excluding impairments that are deemed other than temporary  net of the related tax effect  if any  are not reflected in earnings but are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss until realized 
realized gains and losses and impairments that are deemed other than temporary are determined on the specific identification method and are reflected in income 
investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses and realized gains and losses are included in the earnings of the company 
as of december   long term cash investments totaling million consist of six auction rate securities ars with an aggregate par value of million 
our ars are floating rate securities with longer term maturities which were marketed by financial institutions with auction reset dates at day intervals to provide short term liquidity 
the underlying collateral of the ars we hold consists primarily of corporate bonds  commercial paper  debt instruments issued by the us treasury and governmental agencies  money market funds  asset backed securities  collateralized debt obligations  similar assets  and in one instance  preferred stock in a bond insurance company 
certain of the ars may have direct or indirect investments in mortgages  mortgage related securities  or credit default swaps 
the credit ratings for five of the ars were aaa and for one of the ars was aa at the time of purchase 
beginning in august and into september  each of the ars auctions began to fail due to a lack of market for these securities 
as of the fourth quarter of  the credit ratings of four of the ars were baa the credit rating on a fifth ars was baa and the credit rating on a sixth ars was b in addition the investments currently lack short term liquidity and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction for the ars investments is successful or until we sell the securities in a reasonable secondary market which currently does not exist 
during  we recorded impairment losses totaling million for the six ars 
in determining whether each ars is other than temporarily impaired we considered the guidance provided by fas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and related guidance 
this guidance specified that we consider a variety of factors including i the quality and estimated value of the investments held by the trust issuer  ii the financial condition and credit rating of the trust  issuer  sponsors  and insurers  and  iii the frequency of the auction function failing 
future changes in these and other factors could result in additional realized impairment losses 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and cash investment balances of million as of december  and expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity for the ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business 

table of contents the fair values of the ars as of december  are based on an estimation using a discounted cash flow model for each of the six ars using credit related discount rates and term to recovery as key inputs 
changes in assumptions and other factors could result in additional realized impairment losses 
for example  if the assumed discount rate was increased by basis points for each ars  then the total estimated fair value of the company s ars portfolio would decrease million and the impairment charge to earnings in the fourth quarter would have increased by million 
similarly  if the assumed term to recovery was increased by year for each ars  then the total estimated fair value of the company s ars portfolio would decrease million and the impairment charge to earnings in the fourth quarter would have increased by million 
notwithstanding our valuation of the securities in accordance with fas and our determination that these securities were other than temporarily impaired in accordance with fas  we have both the intent and ability to hold these securities until a reasonable market returns 
accordingly  while the current valuation of these securities follows gaap  management believes that it is possible that the proceeds we receive on the ultimate liquidation of certain of these securities may be higher than their current recorded value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable 
in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses  judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers  an assessment of current economic and industry trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future  and other factors 
our allowances have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our allowance will continue to be adequate 
for example  our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million at december  if our allowance for doubtful accounts  including identified specific customer matters  changed by our allowance for doubtful accounts and operating results would change by million 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs after a product becomes technologically feasible and before its general release to customers 
our net capitalized software totaled million at december  significant judgment is required in determining when a product becomes technologically feasible 
capitalized development costs are then amortized over the product s estimated life beginning upon general release of the product 
quarterly  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and selling the product the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products and the future costs of completing and selling certain products 
changes in these estimates could result in write offs of capitalized software costs 
capitalized software amortization and write off charges totaled million in amortization of capitalized software cost included write offs of million in see note one to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregating foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation  and determining required intercompany revenue sharing  cost reimbursement and other transfer pricing arrangements among related entities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
remittances of foreign earnings to the us are planned based on projected cash flow  working capital  stock buyback and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations 
based on these assumptions  we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the us and provide us federal taxes on these amounts 
material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent to be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we evaluate our valuation allowance each quarter based on factors such as the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  current taxable income and forecasted future taxable income 
forecasts of future taxable income are further refined as a result of each year s budget and goal setting process generally occurring annually in the fourth quarter 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
for example  as a result of the company s assessment of its valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets for the three month period ending december   the company concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of its deferred tax assets relating to federal tax loss carryforwards and state tax loss and credit carryforwards will be realized based on a number of factors including projections of future year federal taxable income and  in the case of state credits and losses  projections of future year taxable income in the relevant states 
as a result of this re evaluation  during the three month period ending december   the company released approximately million of valuation allowances relating to federal tax loss carryforwards  which reduced goodwill  and approximately million of valuation allowances relating to state tax credit and loss carryforwards  of which million reduced tax expense  approximately million reduced goodwill  and approximately million increased deferred tax liability for the related federal tax effect 
as of december   our valuation allowance was approximately million 
the valuation allowance includes approximately million associated with stock option activity for which any recognized tax benefits will be credited directly to shareholders equity if and when the related deferred tax asset is used to reduce current tax payable 
the remaining valuation allowance relates primarily to federal net operating loss carrfyorwards and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  which  if realized  will be credited to tax benefit 
realizing the benefit of these loss and credit carryforwards depends primarily on earning sufficient future taxable income in the united states  and in the case of state losses and credits  earning sufficient future taxable income in the relevant states 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 

table of contents as part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the quarter any impairment is recorded 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation process 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions  including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates  in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as adjustments to goodwill 
under fasb statement no 
r  any future adjustments will be recorded as tax expense or benefit beginning with our three month period ending march  on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit assuming that all issues are audited and resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes are considered 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  expiration of statutes of limitation on potential assessments or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
accounting for stock based compensation plans effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a period compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  and b period compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost before income tax benefit related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note seven to the consolidated financial statements stockholders equity  part ii  item we estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns 
we estimated the volatility of our options and stock appreciation rights considering both the 
table of contents historical volatility of our stock over the average expected life of our options and the prices of publicly traded options  consistent with sfas r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the average of the year treasury rates as published by the federal reserve 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we amortize the fair value on a ratable basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates determined under the black scholes option valuation model 
in the future  changes in the assumptions under the black scholes valuation model  or our election to use a different valuation model  could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 
purchase accounting we have made estimates of the fair values of purchased intangible and other assets acquired in conjunction with our purchase of mobile  inc as of november   and other acquired companies after considering valuations prepared by independent third party appraisers and certain internally generated information 
purchased intangible assets  excluding goodwill  totaled million at december  if the subsequent actual and updated projections of the underlying business activity are less as compared to the underlying assumptions and projections used to develop these values  then we could experience impairment losses  as described above 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain of these assets and these lives were used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  then additional depreciation or amortization expense could be incurred on an annual basis 
historically  we have not made any changes in these areas 
if the estimates of the economic lives of the definite lived intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of mobile were reduced by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million 
restructuring our remaining restructuring accruals primarily relate to the estimated net costs to settle certain lease obligations based on analysis of independent real estate consultants 
while we do not anticipate significant changes to these estimates in the future  the actual costs may differ from estimates 
for example  if we are able to negotiate more affordable termination fees  if rental rates increase in the markets where the properties are located  or if we are able to locate suitable sublease tenants more quickly than expected  the actual costs could be lower than our estimates 
in that case  we would reduce our restructuring accrual with a corresponding credit to cost of restructuring or goodwill 
alternatively  if we are unable to negotiate affordable termination fees  if rental rates decrease in the markets where the properties are located  or if it takes us longer than expected to find suitable sublease tenants  the actual costs could exceed our estimates see note thirteen to consolidated financial statements restructuring costs  part ii  item 
table of contents contingencies and liabilities we are involved from time to time in various proceedings  lawsuits and claims involving our customers  products  intellectual property  stockholders and employees 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
when we reasonably determine that a loss associated with any of these matters is probable  and can reasonably estimate the loss  we record a reserve to provide for such loss contingencies 
if we are unable to record a reserve because we are not able to estimate the amount of a potential loss in a matter  or if we determine that a loss is not probable  we are nevertheless required to disclose certain information regarding such matter if we determine that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred

table of contents see note one to consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements  part ii  item financial risk management foreign exchange risk the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency 
we experience foreign exchange translation exposure on our net assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the related foreign currency translation gains and losses from translating these amounts into us dollars for subsidiaries that conduct their business in a currency other than the us dollar  are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income under stockholders equity on the balance sheet 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses  which historically have not been material  are included in interest expense and other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we had identifiable net assets totaling million worldwide 
of those net assets  million were associated with our foreign operations 
as a global concern  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have material adverse or beneficial impacts on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposures have been related to sales and expenses in emea  asia pacific  and latin america  intercompany sublicense fees  intercompany messaging revenues and expenses and other intercompany transactions which are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary recording the transaction 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
specifically  we enter into forward contracts with a maturity of approximately days to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure created by certain balances that are denominated in a currency other than the principal reporting currency of the entity recording the transaction 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts are meant to mitigate the gains and losses on these outstanding foreign currency transactions 
although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past  there can be no guarantee the impact of currency fluctuations related to our intercompany messaging revenues and expenses and other activities will not be material in the future 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in interest expense and other  net 
net foreign exchange transaction gains losses included in interest expense and other  net were million  million and million in  and  respectively

table of contents interest income rate and investment level risk our investments consist primarily of taxable short term money market instruments and debt securities with maturities between days and three years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
based on our intentions regarding investments  we classify our investments as either held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
held to maturity investments are reported on the balance sheet at amortized cost 
available for sale and trading securities are reported at market value 
as a majority of our investments are classified as available for sale such securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  if any  are not reflected in earnings but are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss until realized 
declines in fair value judged to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings 
declines in fair value recorded as impairment losses in earnings have not been material in any reporting period 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method and are reflected in income 
changes in the overall level of interest rates and investment levels affect our interest income that is generated from our investments 
for total interest income was million with investments yielding percent on a worldwide basis on an average investment portfolio that totaled million 
this interest rate level was down from the percent yield earned during if interest rates fell by a similar amount percent in  our interest income would decline approximately million assuming consistent investment levels 
the table below presents the cash  cash equivalents  cash investments  trading securities and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at december  the cash  cash equivalents  cash investments  and trading securities balances approximate fair value at december  amortized weighted average dollars in thousands principal amount interest rate cash and cash equivalents cash investments trading securities total default risk we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe  high investment grade securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity  with the exception of failed auction securities described below 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our investment portfolio  since all investments are made in securities with fixed interest rates 
failed auction securities a small proportion of our investment portfolio is held in auction rate securities with credit ratings ranging from aa to aaa at the time of purchase 
the securities  which met sybase s investment guidelines at the time the investments were made  have failed to settle in auctions since august ars are floating rate securities with long term nominal maturities of to years which are marketed by financial institutions with auction reset dates at day intervals to provide short term liquidity 
the underlying collateral of the ars we hold consists primarily of corporate bonds  commercial paper  debt instruments issued by the us treasury and governmental agencies  money market funds  asset backed securities  collateralized debt obligations  similar assets  and in one instance  preferred stock in a bond insurance company 
certain of the ars may have direct or indirect investments in mortgages  mortgage related securities  or credit default swaps 
at december  we held approximately million in estimated market value in ars for which the reset auctions have failed 
the par value of these securities 
table of contents is million 
the write downs on these securities have been booked in other income and expense 
in addition the investments currently lack short term liquidity and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction for the ars investments is successful or until we sell the securities in a reasonable secondary market which currently does not exist 
therefore  we have moved the balance sheet classification of these investments from short term to long term 
any future evaluations by the credit agencies could result in downgrades to the credit ratings of the ars we hold 
based on our current cash  investment balances and expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate that the lack of short term liquidity for the ars to adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
see note two to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item interest expense rate risk borrowings  which were at fixed rates  as of december   were million 
interest expense was million for sybase might decide to borrow additional funds in the future 
the potential interest rates could be higher in the future than in our past borrowing 
a basis point increase in interest rates of our borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations would increase our interest expense by million annually 
additionally  as further discussed in note one to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  fsp apb takes effect january  and will increase the amount of interest expense we recognize
