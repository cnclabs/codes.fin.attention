critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the company requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the related footnotes 
chromcraft revington considers the following accounting policies to be most significantly impacted by the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the related receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on expected collectability of trade receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on the company s analysis of customer credit worthiness  historical loss experience and general economic conditions and trends 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company evaluates its inventories for excess or slow moving items based on sales order activity and expected market changes 
if circumstances indicate the cost of inventories exceeds their recoverable value  inventories are reduced to net realizable value 
the company changed its method of accounting from the last in  first out lifo method to the fifo method in the company s management believes the new method of accounting for inventory is preferable because the fifo method better reflects the current value of inventories on the consolidated balance sheet  provides better matching of revenue and expense under the company s business model  and provides uniformity across our operations with respect to the method of inventory accounting for both financial reporting and income tax purposes

deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and include net operating loss tax carryforwards
