table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions  as set forth in part i of this report under special note regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in part i item a and elsewhere in this report 
the historical results set forth in this discussion and analysis are not necessarily indicative of trends with respect to any actual or projected financial performance 
overview we are an energy and technology company focused on geothermal power development and technology licensing 
we operate in two business segments power systems and transportation industrial 
our power systems segment is seeking to develop clean  renewable geothermal electric power plants and bottom cycling operations 
our transportation industrial segment focuses on using our symetron technology to improve the efficiency of electric motors  generators and power electronic drives used in electric and hybrid electric vehicle propulsion systems 
through these two business segments  we are employing a well to wheels strategy in an effort to produce a positive impact on the environment and economically beneficial results for our stockholders 
by executing our well to wheels strategy  we aim to become both a producer of clean  geothermal electric power as well as a provider of technologies that enable electric and hybrid electric vehicles with range extenders and improve the efficiency of electric motors and drive systems used in hybrid electric vehicles and other applications 
sources of revenue to date  our primary source of revenue has been from research and development subcontracts  administered through contractors with certain government agencies 
pursuant to these subcontracts  we performed engineering design  development and testing activities in an effort to demonstrate that specific applications of our technology are viable 
we completed the major construction of the cooling towers and transmission lines and installed the utcp power generating units at our thermo no 
project in october the thermo no 
power plant began generating and transmitting nominal quantities of test electricity in december and is expected to become operational at or near full capacity in the first part of our thermo subsidiary expects to realize revenues under the thermo ppa during however  the expected revenues will not have a material effect on our liquidity or our needs for additional financing 
our transportation industrial segment is seeking to generate revenues by licensing our symetron tm technologies to third parties 
we also expect to begin to generate modest revenues in the future from contracts we have entered into for the development of extended range phev demonstration vehicles 
we accepted an initial deposit of  for the production of these vehicles 
we also expect to begin to realize modest revenues from the sale of enhanced motors and generators through our business cooperation agreement with hhi in  although the exact amount and timing of these revenues will be dependent on hhi s ability to implement these enhanced designs into its manufacturing and distribution system 
we also have entered into a licensing agreement with wilson automotive to manufacture and sell enhanced alternators for high output applications 
although progress is being made by each of our business segments  significant revenues may not be generated as expected by either of our segments  if at all 
significant expenses we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had incurred an accumulated deficit and deficit accumulated after re entry into the development stage of approximately million on cumulative revenues since inception of approximately million 
our net losses for the years ended december   and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 

table of contents during the twelve months ended december  our average monthly cash expenditure rate for operations increased to million per month from approximately million per month for the twelve months ended december  the higher spending rate primarily reflects increased professional services associated with designing the financing and tax structures for the project debt and tax equity financing transactions contemplated by our commitment letter with merrill lynch and prospecting and exploration costs associated with geothermal power plant development 
we expect that our average monthly cash expenditure rate will continue to increase as we implement our plans to develop additional geothermal power plants 
for the year ended december   our operating expenses consisted primarily of cost of sales  general and administrative expenses  power project development expenses and research and development expenses 
prior to  our power project development expenses were considered immaterial and were included in general and administrative expenses 
cost of sales for each of the periods presented includes the direct labor  materials and overhead expenses required to perform work on research and development subcontracts 
these subcontracts are now completed  and we intend to further develop certain applications our transportation industrial segment is seeking to commercialize 
general and administrative expenses for all periods presented include expenses related to our marketing  sales  accounting  legal  investor relations  human resources and other administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses also include non cash equity based compensation paid to employees  consultants and service providers 
we have made significant use of non cash equity based compensation to conserve cash and provide incentives to our employees 
we expect to continue to use equity based compensation to provide incentives to our employees and certain service providers 
power project development expenses for the years ended december  and primarily include professional services for mapping  environmental and geological studies and other prospecting costs related to the exploration for geothermal resources 
power project development expenses also include certain legal costs to design the project debt and tax equity financing structure and other operating agreements as well as certain consulting costs relating to project oversight 
we expect that our power project development expenses will increase in future periods as we pursue the development of additional power projects and continue to explore for geothermal resources 
research and development expenses for all periods presented primarily include the costs incurred by our transportation industrial segment in connection with engineering design  development and testing of the technologies it is seeking to commercialize 
total engineering expenses for each period are allocated between cost of sales and research and development based on the engineering time and expenses by project 
regarding our research and development expenses  the recent economic downturn has had a dramatic adverse effect on the automotive industry and other large industrial manufacturers that would be in a position to use and benefit from our technologies 
as a result  we believe our ability to commercialize our symetron technologies may be limited until economic conditions improve 
in the interim  we have taken steps to reduce the resources committed to new developmental efforts 
we intend to evaluate the prospects for our transportation industrial segment on an ongoing basis 
if we believe there are attractive opportunities  we will devote the resources to pursue those opportunities to the extent we believe appropriate 
if  on the other hand  we determine that the risks and uncertainties for this business segment are too great in light of the current economic climate  we may choose to further reduce the resources devoted to these efforts 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
the application of these policies requires management to use significant judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain when reporting financial results 
such estimates are based upon management s historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  management s observance of trends in the transportation  industrial 
table of contents and power production industries  information provided by our customers and information available to management from other outside sources  as appropriate 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
we describe specific risks related to these critical accounting policies below 
in addition  our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of our audited consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item of this annual report 
regarding all of our accounting policies  we caution that future results rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
our critical accounting policies include the following accounting for geothermal activities capitalization of costs revenue recognition investments allowance for uncollectible accounts impairment of long lived assets tangible and intangible asset retirement obligations valuation allowance against deferred income taxes equity based compensation business consolidations fair value measurements deferred finance costs accounting for geothermal energy activities each geothermal power project we develop consists of three phases 
during the first phase  the site is identified and evaluated 
during the second phase  the power plant  transmission lines and pipelines are constructed and the production and reinjection wells are drilled 
the third and final phase is the production phase  during which the power plant is operated over its useful life 
site identification and evaluation phase 
the first step in the site identification and evaluation phase is the identification of potential project sites 
as part of the identification process  we incur a variety of costs  which may include costs for topographical studies  geological and geophysical studies  rights to access and study properties  technical materials and maps 
regardless of whether we pursue a project at a particular site  all of the costs associated with the identification of a potential site are considered exploratory in nature and are expensed as incurred 
the next step in the site identification and evaluation phase is land acquisition  pursuant to which we acquire land  lease land  or otherwise obtain the appropriate property interests to develop a potential project 
lease acquisition costs  including lease bonuses  legal costs  permit costs  and the fair value of other forms of compensation to acquire leases are capitalized as power project leases when incurred 
the power project leases are not amortized until the related power plant is placed in service 
at that time  the related power project leases are capitalized as geothermal property plant and equipment and amortized over the estimated useful life of the geothermal power plant 
from time to time  we also purchase land outright to develop 
any land we purchase outright is not amortized and is stated in our financial statements at historical cost 
once we have acquired an interest in a geothermal property  we also incur costs to carry and maintain the undeveloped property until we are in a position to determine whether or not to pursue a project on the property 
these costs can include delay rentals  certain taxes on the properties  legal costs for title defense  and the maintenance of land and lease records 
all of these costs are expensed when incurred 

table of contents after  or occasionally prior to  the time we acquire an interest in a property  we conduct additional internal and external studies to determine whether to initiate the development of a project at the site 
as part of this process  we may drill slim holes or conduct other activities to help identify the general location and characteristics of the potential geothermal resource 
all of these costs  including slim holes  are considered exploratory in nature and are expensed as incurred 
construction phase 
we only decide to pursue a project at a site if we determine  with a high degree of confidence  that the site contains an adequate renewable geothermal resource to support a plant that will continually produce electricity without any substantial degradation of the heat resource 
once we have made this determination for a site  the project begins the second development phase  which consists of drilling production and reinjection wells  as well as constructing the power plant  transmission lines and pipelines 
before drilling and construction can begin  we must obtain appropriate permits 
permitting costs are capitalized as part of the project costs 
we capitalize permitting costs and record them as either well field development in progress or construction in progress 
after obtaining appropriate permits  we begin to develop the well field for the project by drilling large diameter production holes 
each hole we drill will result in either a production well  a reinjection well  or an unsuccessful well 
production wells and reinjection wells will ultimately be used in the geothermal power plant 
therefore  drilling costs for production wells and reinjection wells are capitalized 
drilling costs associated with unsuccessful wells are expensed in the period in which we determine they cannot be used 
capitalized costs associated with well field development in progress are reclassified as geothermal property  plant and equipment once the plant is placed in service and amortized over the estimated useful life of the plant  or years 
construction of the geothermal power plant  the related transmission lines and the required substation takes place either concurrently with or subsequent to the drilling of the production and reinjection wells 
the costs associated with construction of the power plant and related transmission lines are accumulated and capitalized over the construction period 
we begin to depreciate the construction related costs over the estimated useful life of the plant once the power plant is placed in service 
the estimated useful life of our power plants is estimated to be years 
as part of the financing for a project  we incur costs to obtain a report from an independent engineer verifying the production capacity of the well field 
the costs associated with the engineer s report are expensed as consulting costs and other financing related costs  such as legal costs  broker fees  and accounting fees are capitalized when incurred 
the tax incentives associated with these renewable energy projects have placed in service deadlines 
we have incurred and may incur in the future  significant additional costs during this phase in order to meet the placed in service deadline 
production phase 
the final phase of a project is the energy production phase 
the energy production phase begins when the plant is completed 
operating costs incurred during the energy production phase are expensed as incurred 
prepaid commissions  if any  pursuant to power purchase agreements relating to the project are amortized over the life of agreements 
as of december   no geothermal power plant had been placed in service 
capitalization of costs our determination to move forward with the process to construct the power plant  transmission lines  production wells and pipelines for a geothermal power project is based on management s determination  with a high degree of confidence  that a given site contains adequate renewable geothermal resources to support a plant that will continually produce electricity without any substantial degradation of the heat resource 
this determination involves significant management judgment and is based on the information available at the time 
once this determination has been made  we begin to capitalize certain construction related costs 
although management s determination to proceed with construction activities and capitalize construction related costs is 
table of contents based on a high degree of confidence that a sufficient geothermal resource exists  the information available and the uncertainties associated with potential geothermal resources could later prove our management s judgments to be incorrect 
if management s judgments with respect to a project prove to be incorrect  we may have to write off significant costs associated with that project that were previously capitalized  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with applicable accounting standards and guidance  including staff accounting bulletin or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  as amended 
although we have earned limited revenue since inception  we expect to earn revenue in the future from both of our business segments 
revenue generated from our power systems segment is generated primarily through the sale of electricity in accordance with long term power purchase agreements entered into with investor owned utilities and municipalities 
revenues related to the sale of electricity from our geothermal power plants are recorded based upon the output delivered provided at rates specified under relevant contract terms 
we began generating and transmitting nominal quantities of test electricity at our thermo no 
geothermal power plant in december the amount of test electricity transmitted was netted by the power company against the cost of the electricity utilization during the same period 
the net amount was insignificant 
therefore  no revenue was recorded in because revenue is recognized based upon metered output of electricity  decreases in well output or the power generating capability of the power generating units may significantly affect the amount of revenues recognized during a specified period 
however  utcp has guaranteed  under certain conditions  that the power generating units will be operating at a minimum of combined capacity 
if the power generating units fail to maintain the minimum of of combined capacity  we will be entitled to certain liquidated damages based on the actual capacity achieved 
pursuant to the thermo financing agreements described above  we have agreed to serve as the engineering  procurement and construction contractor epc contractor for our thermo subsidiary and have guaranteed the completion of the construction of the thermo no 
project 
accordingly  as epc contractor  we received intercompany revenues from our thermo subsidiary for the completion of certain construction related milestones 
in addition  we have also agreed to serve as the operations and management manager o m manager for the thermo no 
geothermal power plant 
accordingly  as o m manager for our thermo subsidiary  we expect to receive quarterly fees for the services we perform 
we also expect to receive distributions from our thermo subsidiary related to achieving substantial completion of the thermo no 
power plant and other fees for providing general administrative services 
however  since the thermo subsidiary is a consolidated entity  these intercompany distributions and fees are eliminated in consolidation 
revenue is generated through our transportation industrial segment from the sale of prototypes of our motors or phev demonstration vehicles to private companies for testing and simulation and from fees and royalties generated by the sales of products and solutions of our licensed manufacturing partners 
revenue from subcontracted engineering services is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
costs incurred to achieve the performance criteria are deferred and recognized concurrent with the recognition of revenue unless they are determined to be unrecoverable 
for contracts in which the fee is estimated to equal of the cost to complete the contract  we recognize revenue as the cost is incurred to complete the project using zero as our estimate of profit under the percentage of completion method 
if estimated costs exceed projected revenues for a reporting period  we recognize a loss on the contract 
under the percentage of completion method  changes in the estimated time and cost to complete the contract may affect the time period over which the unrecognized revenues and related costs are recognized 

table of contents revenue from the sales of prototypes is recognized when the prototype is delivered to the customer 
during  we accepted an initial deposit of  for the production of two extended range phevs 
the initial deposit is recorded as unearned revenue until the vehicles are delivered 
if we are unable to deliver the vehicles  the deposit will be returned 
investments we classify investment securities as either available for sale or held to maturity 
available for sale securities and are recorded at fair market value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses  which are calculated based on the specific identification method  are recorded in operations as incurred 
we did not have short term investments classified as available for sale during the years ended december  and  respectively 
accordingly  there was no unrealized gain or loss relating to available for sale short term investments recorded for the year ended december  or  respectively 
held to maturity securities include us government strips that have coupon dates and coupon amounts that correspond with the amount of interest payable for first four semi annual interest payments to the holders of our convertible notes 
the held to maturity securities are carried and amortized at cost 
available for sale and held to maturity securities are assessed for impairment periodically 
to determine if the impairment is other than temporary  we consider the duration and severity of the loss position  the strength of the underlying collateral  the term to maturity  and credit rating 
for investments that are deemed other than temporarily impaired  losses are recorded and payments received on these investments are recorded using the cost recovery method 
all of our current investments in securities consist of held to maturity securities backed by the united states government  as a result  we do not believe there was any impairment of our investments in held to maturity securities during in determining whether there was any impairment of available for sale and held to maturity securities  we must make judgments relating to the classification of our investments as either available for sale or held to maturity 
if these judgments prove to be incorrect  it could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
allowance for uncollectible accounts contractual rights to future payments associated with trade accounts receivable and notes receivable are evaluated to determine the likelihood of collecting amounts due 
the evaluation includes a review of available financial information related to the debtors ability to pay  historical payment pattern  security positions  government regulations  most recent communications and an assessment of current economic conditions in determining the net realizable value of our receivables 
we also review our allowance for uncollectible accounts in aggregate for adequacy following this assessment 
changes in the customer s economic environment could reduce our ability to fully collect the receivable 
impairment of long lived assets tangible and intangible administrative equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging from three to seven years 
leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated over the remaining life of the lease 
costs of internally developing  maintaining or restoring patents and trademarks that are specifically identifiable and have determinate lives are capitalized 
the costs of patents are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life or years from the date of the first filing 
the costs of trademarks are capitalized but not amortized because their useful lives are indefinite 
costs incurred to acquire our global heat transfer technology license have been capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related patents underlying and accompanying the license  or years 

table of contents we assess recoverability of our patents by determining whether the amortization of the balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate which reflects our average cost of funds 
we periodically review our long lived assets  including our well field drilling costs  geothermal power plant and transmission line construction costs  equipment and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate  at each balance sheet date  whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment 
the carrying value of other long lived assets  such as the well field drilling costs  geothermal power plant  transmission line construction costs  equipment and intangible assets is considered impaired in accordance with fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate that reflects our average cost of funds 
in connection with performing the fas analysis  we exercised significant judgments including the assumption that our geothermal power plant will produce electricity over years and a power purchase agreement will be renewed after its expiration 
in accordance with fas  we evaluated our long lived assets at december  and determined that only our well at the truckee project location was impaired under fas we also determined in the fourth quarter of that  although not impaired under fas  two additional wells at our thermo no 
project would not likely be used in the production of electricity and were expensed accordingly 
the impairment of the truckee well was primarily due to the current world wide economic conditions that have led to tightening credit markets 
as a result  the future undiscounted cash flows from the truckee well have become uncertain because of the re prioritization of our projects based upon the changing economic conditions 
in light of the fact that we have re prioritized other projects ahead of the truckee project and the fact that it is uncertain whether we will seek to secure additional drilling and project financing for the truckee project in the near term  we recognized an impairment of the truckee well and expensed million of capitalized costs during the fourth quarter of management believes that this well could still be used as either a production or re injection well in the future should the appropriate financing be obtained 
also  in accordance with our policy  we identified two completed wells at the thermo no 
project that are unlikely to be used for the production of electricity at the thermo no 
geothermal power plant 
although one well initially exhibited production level heat  it was damaged 
after marginally restoring the well  we determined that the costs associated with the well should be expensed 
although  the other well also initially demonstrated marginal production capabilities  it was determined that the well may not be used for the production of electricity in the near term 
accordingly  we expensed the total costs associate with both of these wells at december   which totaled million 
our power project leases are considered contract based intangible assets as defined in fas  business combinations and the costs to acquire the power project leases are capitalized accordingly 
impairment of the power project leases is evaluated in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets which consists of a comparison of the fair value with its carrying amount at the balance sheet date 
we evaluated our intangible assets for impairment at december  in accordance with fas and determined that none of our intangible assets had been impaired 
in determining whether our long lived assets have been impaired  we must make judgments relating to the fair value of those assets 
if these judgments prove to be incorrect  it could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
asset retirement obligations we have incurred certain liabilities related to the retirement of assets in connection with drilling wells and constructing our first geothermal power plant in utah 
these liabilities include our obligations to plug wells upon termination of our operating activities  dismantle geothermal power plants upon cessation of operations and perform certain remedial measures related to the land on which such operations were conducted 
when a new 
table of contents liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded  we capitalize the costs of such liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related power project lease 
such liability is accreted to its future value each period  and the capitalized cost is amortized over the useful life of the related geothermal power plant or years 
as of december   the present value of our asset retirement obligations totals million 
at retirement  we will either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or a loss with respect thereto  as applicable 
revisions in estimated asset retirement obligations may result from changes in estimated inflation rates  discount rates  retirement costs and the estimated timing of settling asset retirement obligations 
valuation allowance against deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded when there is a difference between the financial reporting and tax treatment of financial transactions 
we recorded a valuation allowance to offset the entire net deferred tax asset as of december   and  respectively 
the valuation allowance was recorded due to the losses incurred and the uncertainties regarding the future taxable income and recoverability of such deferred tax assets 
we continually evaluate the estimated recoverability of deferred tax assets 
equity based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under the revised standard  companies may no longer account for share based compensation transactions  such as stock options  restricted stock  and certain other potential payments using the intrinsic value method as defined in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
instead  companies are required to account for such equity transactions using an approach in which the fair value of an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
compensation expense is adjusted for equity awards that do not vest due to the fact that service or performance conditions are not satisfied 
however  compensation expense already recognized is not adjusted if market conditions are not met  such as when stock options expire out of the money  or when options expire unexercised 
stock options and warrants granted to non employees for services are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r and emerging issues task force  eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods  or services 
these standards require expense recognition based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted 
we calculate the fair value of options and warrants granted by using the black scholes option pricing model as of either the grant date or performance completion date  as applicable 
we base our black scholes assumptions used to calculate the fair value of equity instruments on certain historical and estimated future events 
in the event that such estimates are incorrect  then the equity based expenses will change and as a result may affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we have issued shares of common stock to certain employees and directors as payment for services and have entered into agreements to issue stock over a specified vesting period 
we have also issued shares of common stock to non employees as payment for services and have entered into agreements to issue stock either when a performance condition has been completed or based upon a specified vesting period 
stock issued for services  to both employees and non employees  is valued based on the fair value on either the grant date or the performance completion date as required by sfas no 
r and eitf and is recognized over the requisite service period 
in determining the fair value of stock issued for services  we must make judgments relating to pre requisite service periods  estimated option lives  risk free rates  stock volatility  forfeiture rate and likelihood of completing an applicable performance conditions 
if these judgments prove to be incorrect  it could have a material effect on our results of operations 

table of contents business consolidations in august  we entered into various financing arrangements in which we sold class a membership in thermo no 
be  llc the thermo subsidiary to merrill lynch the class a member for million representing of the agreed upon value of the thermo subsidiary which was million 
we  through our wholly owned subsidiary maintained the class b membership representing of the agreed upon value 
under the financing arrangements  the tax benefit and profit loss allocations is to the class b member and to the class a member until the class a member achieves a internal rate of return irr on the project which is expected to be in the th year of operations at the thermo project 
upon achieving a irr  the equity ownership will flip to to us through the class b member and to the class a member  which is expected to begin in the th year of operations 
according to financing agreements between the company and the class a member  we also contributed as equity to thermo no 
the fair value of six leases to serve as collateral securing the class a member s financing 
these leases had a fair value of approximately  and consisted of acres used for the current well field and  additional acres of surrounding leased property 
we also contributed as equity to thermo no 
completed well field costs of approximately million 
we evaluated the class a and class b member voting rights  the minority holder s substantive participative and protective rights  and conditions outlined in fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised december and interpretation of arb no 
and determined that the thermo subsidiary should not be classified as a variable interest entity and that the subsidiary should continue to be consolidated for financial statement purposes 
in determining whether our subsidiaries should be classified as variable interest entities  we must make judgments about the minority holder s substantive participative and protective rights and the other conditions outlined in fin r 
if these judgments prove to be incorrect  and the thermo subsidiary must later be deconsolidated  it could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
fair value measurement fasb statement no 
 the fair value option of financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
was effective january  under this standard  we are permitted to elect to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with the change in fair value recorded in earnings 
we elected not to measure any eligible items using the fair value option in accordance with sfas no 
we did not elect the fair value option for any financial instruments  therefore  sfas no 
did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas effective january  consistent with sfas  we implemented guidelines relating to the disclosure of our methodology for periodic measurement of our assets and liabilities recorded at fair market value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and 
table of contents level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions  such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
our level assets primarily include our cash and cash equivalents including our money market accounts  accounts receivable  notes receivable  interest receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the immediate or short term maturities of these financial instruments 
valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities 
our level assets include our restricted cash certificate of deposit 
valuations are generally obtained from third party pricing services for identical or comparable assets or liabilities and validated through back testing to trade data or confirmation that the pricing service s significant inputs are observable or determined through use of valuation methodologies using observable market inputs such as market interest rates 
we do not currently have level assets 
the carrying value and estimated fair value of our debt instruments at december  were as follows december  estimated fair value carrying value note payable long term senior secured note long term convertible senior notes total liabilities due to the original issue discount  cash proceeds of debt are less than the face value of the debt 
therefore  the effective interest rate of is greater than the stated rate 
represents face value of debt without consideration of the original issue discount of  as of december  we did not have any debt instruments at december  the estimated fair value of our short term note payable approximates the fair value of  shares of our common stock as of january   based on a closing market price of per share  or an aggregate of  to settle the note payable  which has a carrying value of approximately  the estimated value of our long term senior secured note was determined with the assistance of a third party valuation consultant using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the projected cash outflows and a discount rate  which was derived from market and non market inputs 
our estimate of the value of our long term senior secured note depends on judgments relating to the projected cash flows and discount rate 
if these judgments prove to be incorrect  it could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
to estimate the fair value of our long term convertible senior note  we used a third party pricing service that estimated the fair value based upon theoretical values based on assumptions that market participants would use to price the convertible notes 
deferred finance costs deferred finance costs are recorded at cost and include costs relating to undertaking debt financing activities 
upon successful completion of the related financing  these costs associated with equity financings will be recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital or  the costs associated with debt financings are amortized as interest expense over the life to maturity of the debt 
if related financing is not successfully completed  these costs will be charged to the statement of operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue operating expense cost of sales general and administrative power project development unsuccessful and impaired wells research and development total operating expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense other loss before income taxes and minority interest income tax benefit minority interest from sale of minority interest in subsidiary from operations of subsidiary net loss loss per common share basic and diluted weighted average common shares basic and diluted comparison of years ended december  and revenue during the year ended december   we recognized revenue totaling million 
revenue decreased million from the year ended december  as a result of completing our research and development subcontract with arinc in the first quarter of we accounted for this subcontract on a percentage of completion basis 
operating expenses cost of sales 
we reported cost of sales for the years ended december  and totaling million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cost of sales for compared to the prior year is primarily related to a  loss during the first quarter of resulting from costs greater than originally anticipated to complete the arinc subcontract objectives that did not occur in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in equity based non cash employee compensation expense  which declined to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period of equity based non cash compensation expense was higher during the year ended december  due to the vesting of a larger number of executive stock and option grants 
equity based non cash service provider compensation for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million from the same period in while no shares issued to service providers were expensed as general and administrative 
table of contents during   shares of common stock were issued to a provider of financial advisory services during the year ended december  totaling million 
we also granted to a service provider  options to purchase shares of our common stock during totaling million 
this decrease is partially offset by increased professional services associated with financing structuring  which increased approximately million during the year ended december  over the same period in employment related costs increased approximately million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of  reflecting higher average salaries and employment levels required to support the ramp up in activity of the power systems segment 
office expenses totaled million for the year ended december   which represents an increase of million when compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to increased service fees to administer the cash payments for the thermo no 
project and additional office related expenses due to current year corporate expansion 
power project developments 
power project development expenses during the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  equity based non cash employee and contractor compensation for the year ended december  increased million over the year ended december  as a result of stock option grants to new employees 
employment related costs for power project development employees increased during the year ended december  by million over the same period of as we increased our work force levels to execute our business plan 
during the twelve months ended december   professional services relating to geological engineering consulting and legal fees associated with designing debt and tax equity financing structures contemplated by financing commitments under our commitment letter with merrill lynch increased million over the same period of property related expenses such as delay rentals  completed transmission line capacity studies and insurance increased during the year ended december  over the same prior year period by approximately million due to incurring delay rentals on the anniversary date of each of our geothermal leases that we acquired 
in addition  since we began construction of our thermo no 
geothermal power plant in  we incurred costs related to performing transmission line capacity studies and certain insurances that were not incurred in the previous year 
during the year ended december   other expenses also increased by million as compared to the same period in due primarily to writing off a promissory note that we deemed to be uncollectible and expensing certain lease acquisition costs relating to properties in california  utah and washington that we are no longer pursuing 
unsuccessful and impaired wells 
unsuccessful and impaired wells increased million during the year ended december  over the prior year ended in december the increase is primarily due to expensing two wells at the thermo no 
project and determining that the well at the truckee was impaired and should also be expensed 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the testing of our utcp power generating units and began generating and transmitting nominal quantities of test electricity 
as a result of evaluating the combined production capacity of the geothermal power plant and the combined electricity producing capacity of the production wells  in accordance with our policy  we identified two completed production sized wells that are unlikely to be used for the production of electricity at the thermo no 
geothermal power plant 
although one well initially exhibited production level heat  it was damaged while attempting to seal off a production zone 
after redrilling and marginally restoring the well  with the assistance of independent consultants  we determined that since it was unlikely to be used in the production of electricity  the capitalized costs of the well should be expensed 
in addition  the second production sized well also initially demonstrated marginal production capabilities  however  we also determined that the well would not likely be used for the production of electricity 
accordingly  we expensed the wells at december  totaling million 
the circumstances that led to the impairment of the truckee well are primarily due the current world wide economic conditions that have led to tightening credit markets 
because of the tightening credit markets  we determined that our access to capital may be constrained in the future 
accordingly  we prioritized our cash uses  concentrating our efforts on our largest known resources 
as a result  the future undiscounted cash flows from the truckee well have become uncertain because of the re prioritization of our projects based upon the changing 
table of contents economic conditions 
therefore  we considered our ability to raise sufficient financing necessary to continue drilling at the truckee project and determined it was uncertain if we would be able to finance continued drilling at the truckee project in the near term in addition to our other projects of higher priority 
because of this uncertainty  we expensed million in the power systems business segment in the fourth quarter of accordingly 
management believes that this well could still be used in the production of electricity as either a production or re injection well in the future  should the appropriate financing be obtained 
research and development 
research and development expense increased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  equity based non cash employee compensation for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million from the prior year primarily due to the termination of employment of an employee during cash based employee compensation during the twelve months ended december  decreased by approximately million compared to the year ended december   reflecting a reduction in the number of employees performing research and development activities 
professional services increased by approximately million during the year ended december  over the same period of this increase was due to the timing of consulting work performed by our phev consultants and the hiring of a former key employee as a consultant 
the portion of engineering expenses that could be attributed to cost of sales increased approximately million during the twelve months ended december  over the comparable period due primarily to the increased materials consumed in testing our phev prototype 
interest and other income 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease was due primarily to lower average monthly cash balances and decreased interest rates due to the overall economic conditions during the twelve months ended december  compared to the period 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in the increase was due to accrued interest expense relating to the issuance of the convertible notes and the non recourse thermo note 
other expense also increased million during the year ended december  over the same period in due to a provision requiring payments until the registration statement becomes effective for the million fletcher private equity placement 
minority interest 
minority interest for the year ended december  includes the portion of the net loss that is allocated to a third party that owns a minority interest in our thermo subsidiary totaling million 
there was no minority interest in we also incurred a loss on the sale of minority interest in our thermo subsidiary for the year ended december  totaling million 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue during the year ended december   we recognized revenue totaling million 
revenue increased over as a result of progress toward completion of our research and development subcontract with arinc 
our work on the arinc subcontract began in october we account for this subcontract on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue for the year ended december  included million of revenue recognized on our research and development subcontract with advanced energy  which was completed in this subcontract allowed for reimbursement of a percentage of our incurred costs  and was accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
operating expenses cost of sales 
we reported cost of sales for the years ended december  and totaling million and million  respectively 
the increase in cost of sales for compared to the prior year is 
table of contents primarily related to a  loss during the first quarter of resulting from costs greater than originally anticipated to complete the arinc subcontract objectives 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to a reduction in equity based non cash employee compensation expense  which declined to million in compared to million in equity based non cash compensation expense was higher in due to the vesting of a larger number of executive stock and option grants 
equity based non cash service provider compensation for decreased by approximately million from due to the issuance of fewer shares to service providers 
 shares of common stock were issued to a provider of financial services in while  shares of common stock were issued to a provider of financial advisory services in connection with our private equity placement in other employment related costs increased by approximately million during compared to  reflecting higher average salaries and employment levels 
professional service expenses remained relatively constant during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
office expenses increased by approximately million during as compared to due to the general increase in employment levels 
power project developments 
power project development expenses during the year ended december  totaled million 
equity based non cash employee and contractor compensation totaled million 
employment related costs for power project development employees totaled million and professional services relating to geological consulting totaled million 
research and development 
research and development expense decreased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  equity based non cash employee compensation decreased by approximately million from the year ended december  to the current year period 
the decrease resulted from the timing of issuing share grants to research and development employees 
cash based employee compensation decreased by approximately million from the year ended december  to the current year period reflecting a slight reduction in the number of employees performing research and development activities 
the portion of engineering expenses that could be attributed to cost of sales increased during the year ended december  over the comparable period by approximately million primarily due to the increased materials consumed in testing 
interest and other income 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased slightly from the prior year period from million to approximately million 
the decrease is primarily due to higher average monthly cash balances in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents cash certificate of deposit unrestricted portion money market account total recent financing activities since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity instruments  borrowings and project financing arrangements 
most recently  on november   we sold  shares of our common stock at a fixed price of per share in a private equity transaction or million 
we also sold  shares of our common stock on december  for per share  which represents a price per share equal to million divided by of the average of the daily volume weighted average price on the nyse arca exchange for the common stock for the ten business days ending on and including december  
table of contents the gross proceeds from the closing of the november  and december  private placement transactions were  before deducting fees and commissions 
we paid commissions of  to a placement agent in connection with the closing of the private placement transactions 
in connection with this private placement  we issued warrants to purchase up to a maximum of  of our shares of common stock 
under our agreements with the purchaser  we are required to file a registration statement with the sec to register the resale of the shares of common stock acquired by the purchaser 
although we timely filed that registration statement  we will not be in a position to have that registration statement declared effective by the sec until the sec staff has completed its review of our filings 
see item b unresolved staff comments 
our agreements with the purchaser require us to make a cash payment of  to the purchaser each month until the registration statement is declared effective up to a maximum of  as of december   we had accrued for a total of  to the purchaser pursuant to these provisions 
during the third quarter of  we raised net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to an atm equity offering sales agreement with merrill lynch co  merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated 
also during the third quarter of  we obtained project financing for the thermo no 
project 
the project financing arrangements for the thermo no 
project included approximately million of permanent non recourse debt financing for the thermo no 
project with a fixed annual interest rate of 
our thermo subsidiary received proceeds from the debt financing of approximately million for construction of the thermo no 
project after an original issue discount of approximately million 
after the effect of the original issue discount  the effective fixed interest rate on the million of debt financing proceeds is 
from the proceeds of the debt financing  we received approximately million from the thermo subsidiary as repayment for construction costs at the thermo no 
project that were incurred by us prior to closing the project financing 
in addition  pursuant to the project financing agreements  the thermo subsidiary received a capital contribution from the holder of class a member interests of the thermo subsidiary totaling million 
the financing arrangements for the thermo no 
project are described in more detail below 
in march  we raised gross proceeds of million  before deducting fees and commissions from the issuance of the convertible notes 
we placed approximately million of the proceeds in an escrow account to secure payment of the first four interest payments payable on the convertible notes 
we also used approximately million of the proceeds to enter into a forward stock purchase transaction  pursuant to which we will repurchase shares of our common stock  and approximately million of net proceeds to fund a call spread option transaction 
on april   the initial purchaser of the convertible notes exercised its overallotment option and we sold an additional million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
we placed approximately million of the proceeds from the overallotment exercise in an escrow account to secure payment of the first two years of interest payable on the additional convertible notes issued pursuant to the overallotment exercise 
our outstanding convertible notes pay interest semi annually on april and october of each year at a rate of per annum 
as described above  we placed an aggregate of approximately million in an escrow account to secure payment of the first two years of interest payable on the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are convertible  at the holder s option  at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment 
if a fundamental change occurs  holders will have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders who convert their notes in connection with certain fundamental changes may also be entitled to a make whole premium in the form of additional shares of our common stock 
the maturity date of the convertible notes is april  in march  we raised gross proceeds of  before deducting fees and commissions  pursuant to the private placement of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the private placement  we also issued  warrants that were called in august  resulting in additional proceeds totaling million 

table of contents liquidity and certain commitments at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
our operating activities used approximately million  million  and approximately million of cash during the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had approximately million in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
approximately million of this amount was owed to utcp for power generating units received for projects other than the thermo no 
project 
under the terms of our agreement with utcp  these amounts are not due and payable until we have received project financing for these projects and until specific tests have been successfully completed 
approximately million was owed to utcp for the remaining balance on power generating units at our thermo no 
project 
these amounts are to be paid from the million in restricted cash upon successful completion of certain tests to be performed on the units 
the remaining balance of the accounts payable and accrued expenses is for amounts owed for well field development  other equipment and construction costs for the thermo no 
project and for general and administrative costs 
our continuation as a going concern is dependent on efforts to secure additional funding  increase revenues  reduce expenses  and ultimately achieve profitable operations 
if we are unable to secure sufficient  additional funding on reasonable terms  liquidity concerns may require us to curtail or cease operations  liquidate or sell assets or pursue other actions that could adversely affect future operations 
our independent registered public accounting firm s report on our financial statements expresses doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to the company incurring significant losses  the use of significant cash in operations  and the lack of sufficient capital  as of the date the report was issued  to support our business plan through the end of we are not currently generating significant revenues  and our cash and cash equivalents will continue to be depleted by our ongoing development efforts 
until we are in a position to generate significant revenues  we will need to continue to raise additional funds to continue operating as a going concern 
we may seek this additional funding through the issuance of debt  preferred stock  equity or a combination of these instruments 
we may also seek to obtain financing through government funding from grants  loan guarantees and private activity bonds  joint ventures  the sale of one or more of our projects or interests therein  entry into pre paid power purchase agreements with utilities or municipalities  or a merger and or other transaction  a consequence of which could include the sale or issuance of stock to third parties 
we cannot be certain that funding from any of these sources will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to secure adequate funds on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  we may need to curtail or cease operations  modify our current plans for plant construction  well field development and other development activities  or extend the time frame over which these activities will take place 
in addition to funding for general corporate purposes  well field development and certain other general development expenses  we will need to finance each of the geothermal power projects we intend to develop 
as more fully described below  we have entered into a commitment letter the commitment letter with merrill lynch 
the commitment letter sets forth certain general terms relating to the structure and financing of up to mw of geothermal power plants we intend to develop 
as more fully described below  we have obtained financing for the thermo no 
project pursuant to the commitment letter  and we are seeking to fund additional projects in accordance with the commitment letter 
the timing of the funding for additional projects will depend on the progress of our development at the potential sites  and our ability to satisfy any applicable conditions under the terms of the commitment letter and the related financing commitments 
we do not believe the recently completed merger of merrill lynch s parent company with bank of america corporation will adversely affect our relationship with merrill lynch or our plans to develop and finance geothermal power projects 
we continue to work with merrill lynch regarding the potential funding of additional 
table of contents projects in accordance with our commitment letter with merrill lynch 
although we do not believe that the merger of merrill lynch s parent with bank of america corporation will alter merrill lynch s ability or willingness to provide or arrange funding for our projects under the commitment letter or otherwise adversely affect our relationship with merrill lynch  the merger could have unanticipated consequences that we cannot predict 
if unanticipated consequences of the merger adversely affect merrill lynch s ability or willingness to provide or arrange funding for our projects  we will need to seek funding from other sources  which could adversely affect the timing and costs of our future projects 
we intend to continue discussions with other potential sources of capital interested in investing in geothermal energy 
we believe there are other potential capital sources that would be interested in participating as an additional partner in the financing of our future plants 
as part of our geothermal power project development efforts  we have made a variety of financial commitments 
currently  our most significant financial commitments relate to our obligations under our purchase agreements with utcp and other vendors 
these purchase agreements allow us to order and purchase generating units  transformers  pumps  cooling towers  transmission lines  power substations  fire safety equipment and other major electronic components for use in our geothermal power plants 
we also have obligations to pay delay rentals and other expenses associated with the geothermal resources on properties in which we have acquired an interest 
as of december   we were obligated to pay the vendors and the lessors of our geothermal leases approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in our obligations to utcp relate primarily to purchase agreements for the purchase of generating units 
we entered into three such agreements with utcp in in april  we executed a fourth purchase agreement with utcp relating to the purchase of additional power generating units 
concurrent with the execution of the april agreement we paid a down payment of million 
on august   we executed a fifth purchase agreement with utcp relating to the purchase of additional generating units 
concurrent with the execution of the fifth purchase agreement  we paid a down payment of million 
on december   the first purchase agreement with utcp was terminated and the other four purchase agreements with utcp were amended into three separate purchase agreements to properly reflect the actual distribution of the generating units to the thermo no 
project site and establish greater flexibility for distribution of the generating units to future projects 
on december   the first purchase agreement with utcp was terminated and the other three purchase agreements with utcp were amended the amended agreements 
the amended agreements reflect the actual distribution of the generating units to the thermo no 
project site and establish greater flexibility for distribution of the generating units to future projects 
under the amended agreements  the deposits already paid under the previous purchase agreements were allocated to the new purchase agreements consistent with the actual and intended future distributions of the generating units 
as of december   we were obligated to pay utcp approximately million to complete the agreements 
however  under the amended agreements  no additional payments for equipment will be required beyond the initial deposits until the project financing is obtained for each respective project 
once financing is obtained for a project  we are obligated to pay a certain portion of the amounts owed and  once certain tests have been successfully completed for the project  we are obligated to pay the remaining balance 
pursuant to the terms of the amended agreements  if we fail to accept or pay for any of the utcp power generating units we agreed to purchase  we may be required to forfeit all down payments relating to those power generating units and we may be required to pay certain liquidated damages per unit 
accordingly  if we failed to accept or pay for the power generating units we agreed to purchase  excluding those power generating units already installed at the thermo no 
geothermal power plant  the liquidated damages and forfeited down payments would total million 
in addition  utcp has agreed to allow our thermo subsidiary to retain a certain portion of the purchase price of the generating units pending the successful completion of the thermo no 
project 
if the thermo no 

table of contents project is not successfully completed as a result of a problem with the generating units  our thermo subsidiary will keep all or a portion of the retained portion of the purchase price as a liquidated damages payment 
to date  we have funded any required payments under our obligations to utcp and other vendors from our available cash and cash equivalents  including proceeds generated by the financing activities described above 
however  we will need to obtain additional funding to meet these and other similar obligations 
we intend to fund these obligations primarily through project financing for individual power projects in accordance with the terms of the commitment letter and the related financing commitments for individual projects 
however  we may also need to seek financing from other sources 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funding to provide for the timely payment of these obligations and we are unable to renegotiate the terms of these obligations  we could be liable for breach of these obligations 
any failure to make timely payments under these obligations could also adversely affect our relationships with the vendors and cause our geothermal development plans to be delayed 
accordingly  we have reached an agreement with utcp 
under the agreement  no additional payments for equipment will be required beyond the initial deposits until the closing of project financing is obtained for each respective project for a certain portion of the amounts owed and until certain tests have been successfully completed on the remaining balance 
in connection with the purchase of a blm lease for the lightning dock project in new mexico  we also executed a promissory note in february whereby we agreed to pay to the seller  in principal plus  in interest charges on or before january  this obligation was ultimately funded in february through the issuance of our common stock to settle the outstanding debt 
we also have obligations to pay delay rentals and other expenses associated with the geothermal resources on properties in which we have acquired an interest 
generally  these obligations will not be financed as part of a financing commitment for a specific power project  and we will need to finance the payment of these obligations from other sources 
our commitment letter with merrill lynch on january   we  together with our wholly owned subsidiary  truckee geothermal no 
sv  llc  entered into the commitment letter with merrill lynch 
the commitment letter sets forth general terms relating to the structuring and financing of up to mw of geothermal power plants we intend to develop 
we have obtained financing commitments from merrill lynch to provide non recourse financing for our thermo no 
project in utah  our lighting dock project in new mexico  and our truckee project in nevada

project 
on august   we finalized the project financing arrangements for the thermo no 
project and entered into definitive agreements the thermo financing agreements that provide debt financing and tax equity capital for the thermo no 
project 
pursuant to the thermo financing agreements  we have agreed to serve as the engineering  procurement and construction contractor and have guaranteed the completion of the construction of the thermo no 
project 
the useful life of the thermo no 
project is expected to be approximately years 
the useful life of the geothermal resource is expected to be renewable and have a much longer life than the thermo no 
project 

table of contents the thermo no 
project is held by the thermo subsidiary  which is responsible for debt service  all maintenance and operations expenses  and the payment of various fees and distributions to us and merrill lynch 
the following provides further details concerning the terms and conditions of the thermo financing agreements the thermo financing agreements provided for approximately million of permanent non recourse debt financing for the thermo no

the thermo subsidiary received proceeds from the debt financing of approximately million for construction of the thermo no 
project after an original issue discount of approximately million 
after the effect of the original issue discount  the effective interest rate on the million of debt financing proceeds is 
from the proceeds of the debt financing  we received approximately million from the thermo subsidiary as repayment for construction costs at the thermo no 
project that were incurred by us prior to closing the project financing 
thermo is responsible for debt service and is expected to retire the debt through sculpted principal payments over years 
the sculpted principal payments provide for larger principal payments than normal amortization in the earlier years when project cash flows are greatest 
merrill lynch has the right to syndicate its debt obligations under the commitment letter and has done so for the debt associated with the thermo no 
project 
under the thermo financing agreements  tax equity capital for the tax benefits associated with the thermo no 
project was provided to thermo by ml holdings  of which merrill lynch funded approximately million  at the initial funding 
the balance of the tax equity capital  totaling approximately million  was funded in october merrill lynch has the right to syndicate tax equity capital commitment under the commitment letter 
we expect to receive million in development distributions from the thermo subsidiary  of which is expected to be paid to us on the first anniversary of the date the thermo no 
project achieves final completion  with the balance to be due and payable months after completion 
we also expect to receive approximately million annually from thermo for our services as managing member and operator of the thermo no 
project 
prior to the date when the class a member achieves its target rate of return the flip date  we will be eligible to receive a management bonus if the thermo no 
project performs better than expected 
annual operating and maintenance costs for the thermo no 
project are expected to be approximately million and are expected to be paid by thermo from its operating revenues 
these costs include a manufacturer s guarantee and maintenance agreement provided by utcp 
any residual cash flows available after paying all expenses and debt service will be distributed to merrill lynch and to us prior to the equity flip date  which is anticipated to occur between the seventh and tenth year of operation  after which the distribution split will be to merrill lynch and to us 
post flip date distributable cash flows are expected to average approximately million per year until the debt services is completed in year eighteen and approximately million per year after the eighteenth year for the rest of the useful life of the thermo no 
project plus certain residual tax benefits 
our equity contribution to thermo of approximately million was comprised primarily of the completed well field 
in connection with the thermo financing agreements and the thermo no 
project financing  we and our affiliates have entered into certain other ancillary agreements  including a pledge agreement with deutsche bank to secure the payment and performance of the thermo no 
project under the credit agreement 
the pledge agreement grants deutsche bank a continuing security interest in and lien on certain membership interests or other interests in the thermo no 
project 
we have also entered into a guaranty agreement in favor of the thermo no 
project and ml holdings  pursuant to which we guarantee certain obligations of certain parties to the thermo financing agreements 

table of contents the lightning dock commitment on july   pursuant to the commitment letter  we and our subsidiary  lightning dock geothermal hi  llc  entered into a financing commitment letter the lightning dock commitment with merrill lynch relating to the project financing and tax equity funding for what is expected to be a mw geothermal power plant in hidalgo county  new mexico  which we refer to as the lightning dock project 
the lightning dock commitment provides for debt financing and tax equity capital for the lightning dock project 
the tax equity capital is expected to be provided by merrill lynch or  at the option of merrill lynch  by a third party that can utilize the tax benefits provided by the lightning dock project 
the lightning dock commitment provides for up to approximately million of construction and term debt financing and up to approximately million of tax equity capital 
under the lightning dock commitment  we expect approximately million of the tax equity financing will be used to pay down the construction debt at the time the plant is placed in service 
further  we expect the term debt will fully amortize over years of operations 
generally  the finance structure is designed to distribute a significant portion of the first ten years of cash flows after the plant is placed in service to us in the form of distributions and fees during the first two years of operations based upon both the successful completion of the lightning dock project and attainment of on going operational targets 
once the debt for the lightning dock project has been retired and most of the tax benefits have been utilized  we expect that of all of the remaining cash flows of the lightning dock project are expected to flow to us 
it is the intention of the parties that the power generation facilities will qualify to receive tax credits and other benefits under the provisions of the internal revenue code 
the lightning dock commitment is subject to market conditions  due diligence  receipt of all necessary internal approvals by both us and merrill lynch  merrill lynch s satisfaction with the structure of the tax equity financing  the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation and the satisfaction of certain other conditions 
the lightning dock commitment expired on december  however  we intend to work with merrill lynch towards formally extending the expiration date of this commitment in the future and finalizing arrangements for lightning dock in when final permits are approved 
the truckee commitment the truckee commitment expired by its terms on june  since the truckee commitment was negotiated  we have initiated the development of several other projects  and a number of these projects are expected to be developed more rapidly than the truckee project 
therefore  in the fourth quarter of  we determined to postpone our discussions with merrill lynch regarding an extension of the truckee commitment 
we intend to continue our development efforts at the truckee project and seek a new financing commitment from merrill lynch once those development efforts progress to the point when financing is needed for construction of a plant and related development activities 
potential additional financing commitments the commitment letter gives merrill lynch the exclusive right to provide or arrange financing for up to mw of substantially similar geothermal power plants we intend to develop  other than certain excluded financings 
merrill lynch also has a right of first refusal with respect to the financing of an additional mw of geothermal plants to be developed by us 
if merrill lynch provides a financing commitment proposal with respect to any future projects  such financing commitment will be subject to satisfactory due diligence and certain other conditions and the execution of a separate commitment letter relating to such project 
until merrill lynch has financed mw of geothermal power projects under the commitment letter  we are generally obligated to accept any financing commitment proposed by merrill lynch that has terms similar to or more favorable than the financing commitment relating to the thermo plant 
after merrill lynch has financed mw of geothermal power projects under the commitment letter  we may enter into certain excluded financings with parties other than merrill lynch 
prepaid power purchase agreements  government grants and joint venture funding arrangements are considered excluded financings to the commitment letter 

table of contents the timing of construction for the geothermal power plants we intend to develop  as well as the specific sites we choose to develop and construct  will depend on a number of factors  including drilling results  permitting and our ability to obtain adequate financing 
although we have obtained individual financing commitments for certain projects  our development efforts at one or more of these sites may not progress as rapidly as our development efforts at other sites 
as a result  we may seek to finance and construct geothermal power plants on other sites prior to the completion of construction of one or more of the projects for which we have obtained financing commitments 
structuring fees and other consideration as part of the commitment letter  we have agreed to pay merrill lynch certain non refundable structuring fees in connection with the closing of each funding transaction 
the structuring fees will initially be  but will decrease for future financings once the cumulative financing commitment under the commitment letter reaches certain levels 
as additional consideration  we granted merrill lynch warrants to purchase our common stock 
the warrants will vest and become exercisable in increments over the term of the commitment letter based on the actual funding provided 
the exercise price of the warrants is subject to adjustment upon any dilutive issuance by us 
in accordance with the anti dilution protection included in the warrants  the issuance of the convertible notes during the first quarter of  the issuance of common stock during the third quarter of and the issuance of common stock in connection with our private equity placement during the fourth quarter of resulted in a reduction of the original strike prices of the warrants from a range of to to a range of to 
on august   warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock vested in connection with the closing of the project financing arrangements for the thermo no 
project 
in general  warrants that vest in connection with the funding of earlier projects will be greater in number and have a lower exercise price  and warrants that vest in connection with the funding of later projects will be fewer in number and have a higher exercise price 
under certain circumstances  a reduced percentage of the warrants will vest if we reject a merrill lynch funding proposal for a project and subsequently obtain funding for such project from another party or  in certain circumstances  from merrill lynch 
any vested warrants may be called for cancellation by us if certain conditions have been met  including minimum market price requirements relating to our common stock 
we have agreed to grant additional warrants to merrill lynch upon funding of any of the additional mw of geothermal power projects with respect to which merrill lynch has a right of first refusal 
the exercise price of any such additional warrants will be based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock over a consecutive trading day period prior to the issuance of such warrants 
pursuant to a registration rights agreement between us and merrill lynch  we have agreed to file one or more registration statements covering the resale of the warrants issued pursuant to the commitment letter  as well as the resale of the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of such warrants 
when a series of warrants vests  we are obligated to register these securities for resale and cause the registration statement to remain continuously effective until all vested warrants and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants covered by such registration statement have been sold or may be sold without restriction pursuant to rule of the securities act of  as amended 
merrill lynch agreed to permit us to defer our obligation to register the resale of the warrants that vested in connection with the funding of the thermo no 
project until such registration is requested by merrill lynch 
we do not believe the recently completed merger of merrill lynch s parent with bank of america corporation will alter our understanding or merrill lynch s understanding of our outstanding obligations under the registration rights agreement with merrill lynch 
consolidated statements of cash flows operating activities 
cash consumed by operating activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of a net loss of approximately million  adjusted for approximately million of stock based compensation and stock issued for services and million related to management s determination 
table of contents to impair and expense two wells at the thermo no 
project that were not likely to be used in the production of electricity and impair and expense one well at the truckee project as a result of the current economic conditions and tightening credit markets that caused us to reprioritize our cash uses and concentrate our efforts on our largest known resources instead of truckee 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased from million at december   to million at december   primarily due to accrued expenses for well field development  geothermal power plant construction  transmission line construction  and the purchase of power systems equipment for the thermo no 
project 
the portion of accrued liabilities relating to well field development  construction in progress and power systems equipment  totaling million  has been reclassified as a non cash item to decrease the change in accrued liabilities 
deferred revenues increased by approximately million  reflecting a down payment received for our anticipated phev

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we are exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides information regarding our exposure to the risks of changing interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  including million in restricted cash  that were invested primarily in low risk money market accounts and certificates of deposit until needed for operating and other activities 
current money market rates range from approximately to 
the money market interest rates have declined from over the last three months 
if interest rates continue to decline by another  the amount of interest earned on our money market balance would be approximately  lower over a twelve month period 
a review of our money market accounts indicated that no impairment occurred during the year ended december  and no write down in fair value is considered necessary 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into a call spread option transaction with an affiliate of merrill lynch for the cost of million 
the call spread option transaction was intended to reduce the potential dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of convertible notes  which represents a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the call spread option transaction allows us to receive up to  shares of our common stock at per share from the call spread option transaction holder  equal to the amount of our common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would deliver to the holders of the convertible notes upon conversion 
the number of shares that we would receive pursuant to the call spread option transaction declines after the market price exceeds per share to reflect the aggregate market value of million of our common stock 
the call spread option transaction will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the convertible notes or the first day all of the convertible notes are no longer outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
our ability to receive the maximum aggregate market value of shares of our common stock pursuant to the call spread option transaction is dependent upon the performance of our stock price and the desire of holders to convert the convertible notes into shares of our common stock 
if holders fail to convert the convertible notes into shares of our common stock prior to the due date in  the call spread option transaction will expire without the shares of our common stock being delivered to us 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into a forward stock purchase transaction with merrill lynch at a cost of million 
pursuant to the forward stock purchase transaction we are entitled to receive from merrill lynch million shares of our common stock on or about the maturity date of the convertible notes to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes 
if the stock price falls below per share on or about the maturity date of the convertible notes  the aggregate value of our common stock received would be less than the amount paid for the forward stock purchase transaction 
we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on the instruments described above
