item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company provides interior furnishings to original equipment manufacturers of manufactured housing and recreational vehicles and to the hospitality market 
this interior furnishing market is highly competitive 
the company faces risk as the demand for its products is affected by the industry demand in the three markets that the company serves 
any significant decline in the demand for manufactured housing  recreational vehicles  or hospitality accommodations can adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
a large amount of the company s sales are to a relatively few customers 
in  the company s top customers accounted for approximately of net sales  as opposed to in the loss of a large customer can have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
on march   fleetwood filed a chapter bankruptcy 
the accounts receivable due from fleetwood at the time of the filing was approximately  and was fully reserved for in the year end allowance for doubtful accounts 
simultaneously with the bankruptcy filing  fleetwood announced its intentions to close all of its remaining travel trailer plants 
the company will continue to supply fleetwood s manufactured housing and motor home businesses 
the expected revenue from fleetwood in will be significantly less than experienced in prior years 
in the second quarter of  the company s management  recognizing its reduced level of business with fleetwood  totally impaired the remainder of its identifiable intangible asset arising from the january supply agreement with fleetwood 
the company faces the risk that its furnishings could be provided by companies with cheaper labor sources  such as from asian sources 
however  the lack of sufficient lead times from its customers  as well as the customized nature of many of the company s products  presents a substantial barrier to entry for overseas firms 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the recreational vehicle market experienced a sharp decrease in in the number of units shipped 
total industry shipments of motor homes and travel trailers decreased from  in  to  in travel trailer shipments by the rv industry decreased in when compared to  and industry shipment of motor homes decreased by in when compared to the company s sales to the rv industry declined by from to the decrease in the company s sales to the rv industry was directly related to decreased production of recreational vehicles by its customers 
the manufactured housing market has been declining since its peak of  shipments in industry shipments in were  compared to  shipments in  a decrease of 
shipments in were the lowest levels experienced by the industry since the company s sales to the manufactured housing industry increased by in when compared to the increase was due to the acquisition of doris lee draperies on november  without this acquisition  the company s sales to the manufactured housing industry would likely have declined by in the company s sales to the hospitality industry increased during when compared to the previous year 
approximately of this increase is attributable to owning the superior drapery business for all of versus seven months in hospitality sales are affected by demand for hospitality accommodations and the growth of the industry 
this was the highest volume of annual sales experienced by the company to this market

some of the accounting policies require it to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable and inventory 
the company reviews its accounts receivable portfolio frequently  assessing any past due accounts for collectability 
physical inventories are conducted at each of the company s manufacturing facilities at least quarterly  and inventories are assessed for any slow moving or obsolete items  which constitutes the main judgment necessary in valuing the inventory 
reserves for both receivables and inventory are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as required 
other assumptions the company faces are the assessment of goodwill  intangible asset  and long lived assets for impairment  the calculation of the provision for income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company believes that its assumptions in relation to its critical accounting policies have been reasonably accurate  and does not foresee any future material changes in its estimates or assumptions 
liquidity and financial resources working capital at january  was  compared to  at december  the current ratio was at year end compared to at year end the liquid ratio was at year end compared to at year end the funded debt ratio was at january  compared to a year earlier 
the working capital  current ratio and liquid ratio were negatively impacted by the change in classification in june of the revolving debt due wachovia bank 
this item was classified as long term at year end and as short term at year  due to its maturity date of june  net accounts receivable decreased  at january   when compared to december  accounts receivable decreased due to a reduction of sales volume in the fourth quarter of when compared to the fourth quarter of days sales outstanding dso decreased from days at the end of fiscal to days at the end of fiscal the allowance for doubtful accounts increased from  at year end to  at year end the allowance was increased because of management s concern for the viability of specific customers 
subsequent to year end  two of these customers  fleetwood enterprises and monaco coach corp  filed chapter bankruptcies 
the accounts receivable for both of these customers approximately  in total was fully reserved for at year end 
the remaining reserve of approximately  is considered adequate to fully reserve for the remaining delinquent accounts 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in january  the company began assigning certain account receivables under a receivables servicing and credit approved receivables purchasing agreement with cit group commercial services inc only receivables from sales to the hospitality industry may be assigned to cit 
under the agreement cit provides credit checking  credit approval  and collection responsibilities for the assigned receivables 
if cit approves an order from a hospitality customer and the resulting receivables are not paid or disputed by the customer within ninety days of sale  cit will pay the receivable to the company and assume ownership of the receivable 
cit begins collection efforts for the assigned receivables both approved and not approved when they are due hospitality sales are made on net terms 
approved receivables were approximately  at january  hospitality customers are instructed to make payments directly to cit and cit then wires collected funds to the company 
the company pays cit a percentage of all assigned receivables 
management believes this cost is mostly offset by reductions in bad debt expense and collection costs 
the company entered into this arrangement to take advantage of cit s extensive credit checking and collection capabilities 
management believes this arrangement has improved liquidity 
net inventories decreased  at january   when compared to december  the decrease in net inventories was due primarily to lower business sales activity as well as an increase in reserves for slow moving items 
on june   the company acquired certain assets of superior drapery superior for  after adjustments

the additional payments will be no more than  additional payments of  were due for fiscal capital expenditures for were  compared to  in at this time  capital spending for is expected to be less than  in may  the company entered into a line of credit agreement with wachovia bank 
the agreement with wachovia provides for a revolving line of credit of up to  and expires on june  the interest rate is libor plus basis points and the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants 
the loss caused the company to violate the financial covenant in the loan agreement that the ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda may not exceed to 
the company believes it is in compliance with all other conditions of the loan agreement 
wachovia provided a waiver for this violation through the end of the third quarter of the waiver agreement changed the interest rate from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
the waiver has expired and the company is in default of the loan covenant 
at january   the company had  in outstanding borrowings on the line of credit 
the outstanding balance on the line of credit as of march  was  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management has negotiated with wachovia bank  which is now a wells fargo company  for wachovia to continue to fund its line of credit beyond the june  expiration date of its current agreement 
wachovia has initially agreed to provide the company with a forbearance agreement which will run for six months to december  wachovia has suggested that  if need be  it could provide an additional six month agreement through june  although the forbearance agreement has not been completed at this time  wachovia has indicated that the interest rate under the forbearance agreement will be eight percent  and a fee for extending the line will be required 
the company has offered four of its active facilities in sale leaseback packages 
the company has gone to contract on two of these facilities and expects to close on them in may these two transactions will provide proceeds of million 
the proceeds will be used to pay down the line of credit with wachovia 
the remaining two facilities being offered for sale leaseback could provide an additional million in proceeds 
currently  the company is not in active negotiations on the remaining facilities 
in addition  four of the facilities  which were idled in  have been listed for sale 
if the company were to realize its asking price for all of these  the proceeds would be approximately  none of the eight facilities discussed above are currently encumbered with debt 
should all of the above transactions be completed  management projects a year end cash balance in excess of  should none of the remaining transactions occur  working capital provided by the wachovia agreement will be sufficient to support the existing business but will not provide room for growth 
management continues to discuss lending agreements with other financial institutions 
results of operations the company recorded a charge of  during the second quarter of fiscal for the impairment of the company s identifiable intangible asset 
this asset arose from the company s contract with fleetwood enterprises  signed in january the impairment charge was in addition to the regular quarterly amortization that the company had been recognizing since the inception of the contract 
management s analysis determined that the revenues and profit margins provided by the contract had fallen sharply and totally impaired the asset 
the company closed and consolidated five of its manufacturing facilities during one of these  the bloomsburg  pa facility  was closed in march all allowable charges for the closing were recognized in 
a summary of the impairment and closing costs included in the results of operations are item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment of the identifiable intangible asset  regular amortization of the identifiable intangible asset  impairment of assets related to plant closings  severance and other plant closing costs  inventory obsolescence costs related to plant closings  total impairment  amortization  and plant closing costs  the following table shows a comparison of the results of operations between fiscal and fiscal caption fiscal fiscal increase of sales of sales decrease change

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net sales for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal the net sales decrease was 
sales to the recreational vehicle market decreased  primarily due to decreased shipments of motor homes and travel trailers by the company s customers 
the recreational vehicle industry had a decrease in shipments in compared to the prior year 
sales to the manufactured housing industry increased in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
this was due to increased sales from the company s doris lee draperies acquisition 
without this acquisition  the company s sales to the manufactured housing industry would likely have declined by in fiscal the manufactured housing industry had a decrease in shipments in compared to the same period of the prior year 
sales to the hospitality market increased in fiscal  due largely to organic growth from increased marketing efforts and to a lesser extent a full year of operations from the superior drapery acquisition 
cost of products sold as a percentage of sales was in versus in labor costs increased as a percentage of net sales  largely due to reduced volume  shorter lead times and smaller production lot sizes  conditions which may be expected to continue in the current market environment 
the increase in labor costs was more than offset by a change in product mix  improved margins and a reduction in obsolescence charges 
the customized nature of the company s products made to each of its customers unique specifications  does not enable a detailed discussion of the effects of changes in prices  costs  volumes  and product mix on the costs of goods sold percentage 
management does monitor overall material cost  labor cost  and factory overheads for each of its manufacturing locations 
management reviews significant variations or changing trends with general managers

the company uses ebitda as an internal measure of performance and believes it is a useful and commonly used measure of financial performance in addition to income before taxes and other profitability measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
ebitda is not a measure of performance under gaap 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income and income before taxes as an indicator of the company s operations in accordance with gaap 
nor is ebitda an alternative to cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
the company s definition of ebitda can differ from that of other companies
