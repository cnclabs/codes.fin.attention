item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook budget 
united states we have been engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation and development activities throughout onshore us since and in the gulf of mexico since the patina merger and the acquisition of us exploration significantly increased the breadth of our onshore operations  especially in the rocky mountains and mid continent areas 
these two acquisitions  along with other acquisitions of producing and non producing properties  have provided us with a multi year inventory of exploitation and development opportunities 
in  we continued to expand our undeveloped acreage position with the leasing of approximately  net acres in colorado  kansas  montana  wyoming  east texas and oklahoma  along with new leases in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
us operations accounted for of our consolidated sales volumes and of total proved reserves at december  approximately of the proved reserves are natural gas and are crude oil  condensate and ngls 
our onshore us portfolio at december  included  net developed acres and million net undeveloped acres 
we currently hold interests in offshore blocks in the gulf of mexico

wells drilled in and productive wells at december  for our significant us operating areas were as follows year ended december  december  gross wells drilled gross participated in productive wells northern region wattenberg field piceance basin niobrara field tri state area mid continent area other total southern region deepwater gulf of mexico gulf coast onshore and other total total united states 
table of contents northern region the northern region consists of our operations in the rocky mountains area  which includes the denver julesburg d j wattenberg field  piceance  san juan  and wind river basins  as well as the niobrara tri state  bowdoin and siberia ridge fields 
the northern region also includes the mid continent area  consisting of properties in the texas panhandle  oklahoma and kansas 
the rocky mountains area is one of our core operating assets 
during  we acquired a total of approximately  net acres in southern montana  the mid continent area and the niobrara and wattenberg fields 
wattenberg field the wattenberg field approximately operated working interest  located in the d j basin of north central colorado  is our largest onshore us field and continues to grow 
we acquired working interests in the wattenberg field through the patina merger in and acquisition of us exploration in the wattenberg field held of our us proved reserves on december  one of the most attractive features of the field is the presence of multiple productive formations  which include the codell  niobrara  and j sand formations  as well as the d sand  dakota and the shallower shannon  sussex and parkman formations 
drilling in the wattenberg field is considered lower risk from the perspective of finding crude oil and natural gas reserves 
our current field activities are focused primarily on the improved recovery of reserves through drilling new wells or deepening within existing wellbores  recompleting the codell formation within existing j sand wells  refracturing or trifracturing existing codell wells and refracturing or recompleting the niobrara formation within existing codell wells 
a refracture consists of the restimulation of a producing formation within an existing wellbore to enhance production and add incremental reserves 
a trifracture is effectively a refracture of a refracture 
these projects and continued success with our production enhancement program  which includes well workovers  reactivations  and commingling of zones  allow us to increase production and add proved reserves to what is considered a mature field 

table of contents we continue to improve efficiencies in wattenberg field drilling and completion operations and have significantly reduced drilling time by utilizing the latest available technology  including automatic drilling rigs adrs 
an adr uses an automated system to regulate the drill string of a drilling rig in response to current drilling conditions  including drilling fluid pressure  bit weight  drill string torque  and drill string revolutions per minute to achieve an optimal rate of bit penetration 
in  we drilled or participated in wattenberg field development wells  with a success rate and added approximately bcfe of proved reserves approximately of which were natural gas 
at year end  we were running six drilling rigs and completion units in the field 
we have experienced significant growth in production from the wattenberg field  from an average of mmcfepd at year end to approximately mmcfepd at year end approximately of production was natural gas 
however  expansion of field boundaries has resulted in a increase in our crude oil and ngl stream since year end in  sales of wattenberg field production accounted for of total us sales volumes 
the infrastructure in this area is improving and expanding 
oil transport alternatives should improve in with the expected start up of a new interstate crude oil transportation pipeline system which will run from weld county  colorado  where the wattenberg field is located  to cushing  oklahoma 
the pipeline  in which we own a small equity interest  will provide another option for the marketing of our crude oil 
we have entered into a five year throughput agreement with the pipeline 
we continue to acquire acreage in the area and held interests in approximately  net acres at year end we are planning an active capital program in  however  our program may decrease from levels 
we will have the flexibility with short term drilling rig contracts to decrease activity if economic conditions continue to decline 
we will continue to have a strong focus on codell niobrara new drills 
additionally  we have a substantial project inventory remaining and plan to continue steady refracture  trifracture  and recompletion programs in piceance basin the piceance basin in western colorado approximately operated working interest is another core area for us 
it is a major north american natural gas basin  characterized by low porosity rock 
the primary productive formation is the mesaverde williams fork formation 
multiple wells are drilled from individual drilling pads to reduce rig mobilization costs in mountainous terrain and to minimize environmental impact on the surface area 
well spacing is approximately ten acres per well 
as in the wattenberg field  piceance basin drilling time per well has been reduced significantly due to our increased use of improved drilling technology 
in the piceance basin  we are using new fit for purpose rigs which include design innovations and technology improvements that capture incremental time savings during all phases of the well drilling process  including moving between wells 
fit for purpose rigs can drill multiple wells from one location and are particularly useful in developing hydrocarbon resources in tight gas areas such as the piceance basin 
in  we increased our drilling activities and drilled or participated in development wells and one exploratory well  of which were successful 
our drilling activity resulted in the addition of bcfe of proved reserves 
successful drilling activity in recent years has led to significant volume growth  production has grown from mmcfepd in to mmcfepd at year end we have assembled a significant acreage position in the area and currently hold interests in approximately  net acres providing a large inventory of future projects 
at this time  we plan to operate a two rig drilling program in tri state area niobrara our operations in the tri state area eastern colorado  extending into kansas and nebraska center primarily around the development of the niobrara trend approximately operated working interest 
the niobrara formation is an important shallow gas producer 
since  we have expanded our acreage position to over  net acres 
we have a substantial future project inventory  including niobrara infill and exploitation drilling along with gathering system and compressor station additions to develop reserves and deliver new production in we are planning an active capital program in  however  our program may decrease from levels 
we will have the flexibility with short term drilling rig contracts to decrease activity if economic conditions continue to decline 
in  we doubled our drilling activity and drilled or participated in development wells 
increased use of d seismic to optimize well locations helped increase our success rate to over in our drilling activity resulted in the addition of bcfe of proved reserves  and we were producing approximately mmcfepd  net at year end 
short term drilling rig contracts allow flexibility for our drilling plans if economic conditions continue to decline 

table of contents mid continent area the mid continent area includes properties in the texas panhandle  oklahoma and kansas 
significant areas of activity have been the granite wash development in the texas panhandle  infill drilling in several of our oklahoma waterfloods  and deeper completions to the skinner formation in western oklahoma 
we drilled or participated in development wells in  of which were successful and one successful exploratory well 
the potential for granite wash horizontal drilling is currently being evaluated  which  if successful  could increase the recovery of reserves in place and daily production rates 
in july  we expanded into a new area with a  net acre acquisition in western oklahoma  which included approximately mmboe of proved reserves 
the target area is the cleveland sandstone  a tight gas play characterized by low permeability rock 
since acquiring the property we have drilled seven development wells included in the well count above 
there are currently operated wells on the property producing in aggregate a net mmcfepd 
we have the flexibility of operating one to three rigs in with two rigs currently operating 
other we are also active in the bowdoin field approximately operated working interest  located in north central montana  the san juan basin approximately operated working interest  located in northwestern new mexico and southwestern colorado  and the wind river basin approximately operated working interest  located in central wyoming 
in  we drilled or participated in a total of development wells in these areas  of which were successful 
we plan to have reduced activity in these areas in as we focus most of our capital spending on the core development fields of wattenberg  piceance and tri state 
during  we acquired approximately  net exploratory acres in southern montana and plan to test the area in southern region the southern region includes the deepwater gulf of mexico and onshore areas primarily in texas  louisiana  illinois and indiana 
in  we sold all of our significant gulf of mexico shelf properties except for the main pass area  which is currently held for sale 
the sale of our shelf properties allowed us to migrate future investments and growth from the gulf of mexico shelf to the deepwater gulf of mexico which we believe is an area of higher potential 
deepwater gulf of mexico the deepwater gulf of mexico is one of our core areas and accounted for of us sales volumes and of us proved reserves at december  we currently hold interests in deepwater gulf of mexico leases  representing approximately  net acres 
we operate approximately of the leases 
graphic the expansion of our deepwater gulf of mexico program began in with the ticonderoga discovery and the acquisition of additional ownership interests in swordfish and lorien 
since then we have continued to expand our operations primarily through an active exploration program  expansion of our d seismic database  and lease acquisition 
our exploration activities have led to significant discoveries at isabela and redrock raton  and  most recently  gunflint  a discovery which is our largest deepwater gulf of mexico discovery to date 
participation in the central gulf of mexico outer continental shelf sale resulted in our being awarded new deepwater gulf of mexico leases for approximately million  net to our interest  and allows us to expand our inventory with the addition of several new deepwater gulf of mexico prospects in the atwater valley  mississippi canyon  green canyon  walker ridge  and garden banks areas 

table of contents in addition to gunflint  exploration drilling activities included a well at the noble operated tortuga prospect mississippi canyon blocks and  working interest 
although the well was successful in locating hydrocarbons  we decided not to develop the prospect due to near term lease expiration as well as other considerations 
accordingly  we impaired the well in the fourth quarter of we also announced that an exploration well at the stones river prospect mississippi canyon block  working interest did not encounter hydrocarbons in commercial quantities 
we plan to continue exploration activities in by conducting a seismic program and drilling two to three exploratory wells 
our most significant deepwater gulf of mexico properties and current development plans are discussed in more detail below gunflint mississippi canyon block  working interest we originally acquired the block in the central gulf of mexico outer continental shelf sale and announced the gunflint crude oil discovery  our largest deepwater gulf of mexico discovery to date  in october we are currently acquiring additional seismic information and preparing to drill an appraisal well in or early we are the operator of the block 
isabela mississippi canyon block  working interest isabela was a discovery and is non operated 
development planning is underway  phase of which is anticipated to include a producing well with a subsea tieback to an existing production facility 
initial production is currently anticipated in we also have an interest in adjacent acreage with additional exploration potential on mississippi canyon blocks and working interest 
we are currently drilling an exploratory well on block santa cruz prospect 
redrock raton mississippi canyon blocks  and  working interest redrock was a natural gas condensate discovery and raton was a natural gas discovery 
the raton south appraisal well was also drilled during in  we successfully sidetracked and completed the raton discovery well and it was tied back and came on production in late in  we drilled a successful sidetrack appraisal well at raton south  and tie back to a host facility is anticipated in late redrock is currently considered a co development candidate to the completed sidetrack well at raton south 
we are the operator of redrock raton 
swordfish viosca knoll blocks  and  working interest swordfish was a discovery and began producing in in  we drilled and completed a sidetrack to viosca knoll block well  which began production at the end of the swordfish project currently includes three producing wells connected to a third party production facility through subea tiebacks 
we are the operator of swordfish 
ticonderoga green canyon block  working interest ticonderoga is a non operated crude oil discovery and began producing in in  we drilled and completed the and st wells to extend and enhance production from the field 
the wells came on line first quarter the project currently includes three producing wells connected to existing infrastructure through subea tiebacks 
lorien green canyon block  working interest lorien was a crude oil discovery and began producing in the project currently includes two producing wells connected to existing infrastructure through subea tiebacks 
we are the operator of lorien 
in september  hurricanes gustav and ike moved through the gulf of mexico 
inspection of our facilities and equipment indicated there was no major damage from the hurricanes  although damage to third party processing and pipeline facilities has slowed reinstatement of production from our gulf of mexico assets  including lorien and ticonderoga 
approximately mboepd of production remained shut in at year end 
we expect production to resume during the first half of  depending on the successful resumption of pipeline and other non operated facilities 
new albany shale we continue to selectively increase our acreage position in resource plays  including shale plays 
we have accumulated over  net acres in the new albany shale in the illinois basin approximately working interest  located in indiana and illinois 
during  we drilled development wells  of which were successful 
we also drilled development wells in the paxton area  of which were successful  and seven successful exploration wells on our round rock acreage in the illinois basin 

table of contents east texas and north louisiana this is an emerging area for us 
recent acquisitions have increased our leasehold acreage to approximately  net acres 
in  we drilled seven horizontal james lime wells and hosston  travis peak and cotton valley wells  all of which were successful 
we also participated in the drilling of one successful horizontal haynesville shale well in north louisiana 
our drilling program for will focus on the haynesville shale 
other in addition to the east texas and north louisiana programs  we drilled six successful development wells within the south central robertson unit in west texas and two gulf coast exploratory wells

marketing activities we seek opportunities to enhance the value of our us natural gas production by marketing directly to end users and aggregating natural gas to be sold to natural gas marketers and pipelines 
we also engage in the purchase and sale of third party crude oil and natural gas production 
such third party production may be purchased from non operators who own working interests in our wells or from other producers properties in which we own no interest 
we sell our natural gas production at both market based and fixed prices 
in  approximately of natural gas sales were made pursuant to long term contracts under either fixed or market based prices 
crude oil  condensate and ngls produced in the us and foreign locations are generally sold under short term contracts at market based prices adjusted for location and quality 
in china  we sell crude oil into the local market under a long term contract at market based prices 
in israel  we sell natural gas under long term contracts at negotiated prices 
crude oil and condensate are distributed through pipelines and by trucks or tankers to gatherers  transportation companies and refineries 
significant purchaser suncor energy marketing suncor was the largest single non affiliated purchaser of production and purchased our share of crude oil from the wattenberg field in colorado 
sales to suncor accounted for of crude oil sales  or of total oil and gas sales 
no other single non affiliated purchaser accounted for or more of crude oil and natural gas sales in we believe that the loss of any one purchaser would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since there are numerous potential purchasers of our production 
hedging activities commodity prices were volatile in and prices for crude oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors beyond our control 
we have used derivative instruments  and expect to do so in the future  to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to commodity price fluctuations
