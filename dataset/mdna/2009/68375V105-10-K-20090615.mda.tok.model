overview and background we were incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of hitachi  ltd  or hitachi  in september of in july of  clarity partners  lp and related investment vehicles invested in us and we became a majority owned subsidiary of hitachi 
in october  we acquired hitachi s opto device business and expanded our product line into select industrial and commercial markets 
in june we acquired pine photonics communication inc  or pine  and expanded our product line of sfp transceivers with data rates less than gbps that are sold to telecommunication and data communication customers 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of common stock on the nasdaq market 
on january   we completed our acquisition of stratalight communications  inc stratalight which expanded our product line to include gbps subsystems 
we presently have sales and marketing offices in the us  europe  japan and china  which are strategically located in close proximity to our major customers 
we also have research and development facilities that are co located with each of our manufacturing facilities in the us and japan 
in addition  we use contract manufacturing partners that are located in china  japan  the philippines  taiwan  thailand  mexico and the us certain of our contract manufacturing partners that assemble or produce modules are strategically located close to our customers contract manufacturing facilities to shorten lead times and enhance flexibility 
acquisition of stratalight on january   we completed our acquisition of stratalight 
the aggregate consideration consisted of  shares of common stock and million in cash  including the impact of net purchase price adjustments pursuant to the merger agreement 
for the year ended march   stratalight s operations contributed sales of million  and favorably impacted our gross margin percentage as sales of stratalight products generally have higher relative margins 
we also experienced incremental increases of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses related to the stratalight operations 
in connection with the acquisition of stratalight  we expensed million of in process research and development costs  and following the completion of the acquisition  we recognized goodwill impairment charges of million 
sales through our direct sales force supported by manufacturer representatives and distributors  we sell products to many of the leading network systems vendors throughout north america  europe  japan and asia 
our customers include many of the top telecommunications and data communications network systems vendors in the world 
we also supply components to several major transceiver module companies and sell to select industrial and commercial customers 
sales to telecommunication and data communication customers  our communication sales  accounted for  and of our total sales during each of the years ended march   and  
table of contents respectively 
also during each of the years ended march   and  sales of our communications products with gbps or lower data rates  which we refer to as our gbps and below products  represented  and of total sales  respectively 
the number of leading network systems vendors that supply the global telecommunications and data communications markets is concentrated  and so  in turn  is our customer base 
for the year ended march   our top two customers  cisco systems inc and subsidiaries cisco and alcatel lucent  accounted for of our consolidated sales 
nsn and cisco each represented greater than of stratalight s sales for the year ended march  for the quarter ended march   sales to alcatel lucent  cisco and nsn represented of our total sales 
although we continue to attempt to expand our customer base  we anticipate that these customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales 
during the years ended march   and  sales attributed to north america represented  and of total sales  sales attributed to europe represented  and of total sales  sales attributed to japan represented  and of total sales  and sales attributed to asia pacific excluding japan represented  and of total sales  respectively 
cost of sales and gross margin our cost of sales primarily consists of materials including components that are either assembled at one of our three internal manufacturing facilities or at one of several of our contract manufacturing partners or procured from third party vendors 
because of the complexity and proprietary nature of laser manufacturing  and the advantage of having our internal manufacturing resources co located with our research and development staffs  most of the lasers used in our optical module and component products are manufactured in our facilities in komoro and totsuka  japan 
our materials include certain parts and components that are purchased from a limited number of suppliers  or in certain situations  from a single supplier 
our cost of sales also includes labor costs for employees and contract laborers engaged in the production of our components and the assembly of our finished goods  outsourcing costs  the cost and related depreciation of manufacturing equipment  as well as manufacturing overhead costs  including the costs for product warranty repairs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
our cost of sales is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our costs and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in japanese yen 
our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen during the years ended march   and were  and  respectively 
the percentage decline during the year ended march  was primarily attributable to our ability to procure more raw materials denominated in us dollars  and the contribution of cost of sales from the stratalight operations  which were denominated in us dollars 
our gross margins vary among our product lines and are generally higher on our gbps and longer distance gbps products 
our overall gross margins primarily fluctuate as a result of our overall sales volumes  changes in average selling prices and product mix  the introduction of new products and subsequent generations of existing products  manufacturing yields  our ability to reduce product costs and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the percentage decline in our gross margin as a percent of sales during the year ended march  was primarily attributable to reduced average selling prices of most products  higher charges for excess and obsolete inventory  higher per unit costs associated with lower sales volumes and the negative effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates net of hedging programs  partially offset by lower material and outsourcing costs per unit  improved product mix and higher relative margin contribution from sales of stratalight products 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel related to the design  development and quality testing of new products or enhancement of existing products as well as outsourced services provided by hitachi s research laboratories pursuant to our contractual agreements 
we incurred million  million and million in connection with these agreements during the years ended march   and  respectively 
in addition  our research and development expenses primarily include the cost of developing prototypes and material costs associated with the testing of products prior to shipment  the cost and related depreciation of equipment used in the testing of products prior to shipment  and other contract research and development related services 
during the year ended march   we experienced an increase in research and development costs attributable to stratalight operations 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our employees that perform our sales and related support  marketing  supply chain management  finance  legal  information technology  human resource and other general corporate functions  as well as internal and outsourced logistics and distribution costs  commissions paid to our manufacturers representatives  professional fees and other corporate related expenses 
during the year ended march   we experienced an increase in costs as a result of the stratalight acquisition  restructuring activities and the legal expenses associated with defending against class action litigation 
during the year ended march   we experienced an increase in costs as a result of becoming a publicly traded company  including  but not limited to  the costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of impairment of goodwill as a result of the significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and the significant decrease in our market capitalization  for the year ended march   we recorded aggregate write downs of goodwill of million attributable to the previously completed acquisitions of stratalight and pine 
inventory certain of our more significant customers have implemented a supply chain management tool called vendor managed inventory vmi programs that require suppliers  such as us  to assume responsibility for maintaining an agreed upon level of consigned inventory at the customer s location or at a third party logistics provider  based on the customer s demand forecast 
notwithstanding the fact that we build and ship the inventory  the customer does not purchase the consigned inventory until the inventory is drawn or pulled by the customer or third party logistics provider to be used in the manufacture of the customer s product 
though the consigned inventory may be at the customer s or third party logistics provider s physical location  it remains inventory owned by us until the inventory is drawn or pulled  which is the time at which the sale takes place 
given that under such programs we are subject to the production schedule and inventory management decisions of the customer or third party logistics provider  our participation in vmi programs generally requires us to carry higher levels of finished goods inventory than we might otherwise plan to carry 
as of march  and  inventories included inventory consigned to customers or their third party logistics providers pursuant to vmi arrangements of million and million  respectively 
factors that may influence future results of operations global economic conditions the credit markets and the financial services industry continue to experience a period of significant disruption characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions  increased volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability and a significant level of intervention from the united states and other governments 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term or widespread recession  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the global commercial and residential real estate markets and related mortgage markets and reduced consumer confidence have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for most developed and emerging economies continuing into as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies could restrict our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness  increase our costs of borrowing  limit our access to capital necessary to meet our liquidity needs and materially harm our operations or our ability to implement our business strategy 
cost reduction actions during our quarter ended march   we continued to see deteriorating demand from our customers  in part due to their efforts to manage inventory levels in this difficult economic environment 
accordingly  on april  we announced certain plans to reduce our cost structure and operating expenses  including  but not limited to 
table of contents an approximate ten percent reduction in our global workforce and elimination of cash bonuses for the year ended march   a ten percent reduction in executive salaries and director cash compensation  a five percent reduction in salaries for other employees  and suspension of our matching contribution to the k plan  each for a period of not less than six months 
when fully implemented by march   these actions we have taken to reduce our cost structure and operating expenses  together with synergies associated with the stratalight acquisition  are expected to contribute total annualized savings of approximately million 
the majority of the actions will be implemented by june  sales our sales are affected by capital spending of our customers for telecommunications and data communications networks and for lasers and infrared leds used in select industrial and commercial markets 
the primary markets for our products continue to be characterized by increasing volumes and declining average selling prices 
the increasing demand for our products is primarily driven by increases in traditional telecommunication and data communication traffic and increasing demand for high bandwidth applications  such as video and music downloads and streaming  on line gaming  peer to peer file sharing and iptv  as well as new industrial and commercial laser applications 
we have experienced decreasing price trends  primarily as a result industry over capacity  increased competition and the introduction of next generation products 
we anticipate that our average selling prices will continue to decrease in future periods  although we cannot predict the extent of these decreases for any particular period 
we anticipate that in the future sales attributable to europe will represent a greater percentage of our total sales as a result of increased sales to nsn 
our sales are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because certain sales transactions and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
to the extent we generate sales in currencies other than the us dollar  our future sales will be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and could be affected materially 
cost of sales as discussed above  our cost of sales is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our costs and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in japanese yen 
our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen during the years ended march   and were  and  respectively 
the percentage decline during the year ended march  was primarily attributable to our acquisition of stratalight  as well as the fact that we procured more raw materials in us dollars 
while we anticipate that we will continue to have a substantial portion of our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen  we anticipate the percentage of cost of sales denominated in japanese yen to diminish as we plan to expand the use of contract manufacturers outside of japan and procure more raw materials in us dollars and as we realize the full year effect of the stratalight acquisition 
research and development expense we expect that our research and development costs will increase in the year ending march  as a result of the full year contribution of stratalight operations  and in the future will vary with our efforts to meet the anticipated market demand for our new and planned future products and to support enhancements to our existing products 
selling  general and administrative expense we expect that our selling  general and administrative costs will increase in the year ending march  as a result of the stratalight acquisition and in the future will fluctuate with sales volume 
our selling  general and administrative expense will also be impacted by the continuing costs associated with pending litigation 

table of contents significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  warranties and allowances revenue is derived principally from the sales of our products 
we recognize revenue when the basic criteria of staff accounting bulletin no 
are met 
specifically  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists usually in the form of a purchase order  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured based on the creditworthiness of the customer and certainty of customer acceptance 
these conditions generally exist upon shipment or upon notice from certain customers in japan that they have completed their inspection and have accepted the product 
the evaluation and qualification cycle prior to the initial sale of our products generally spans a year or more 
although we negotiate the sale of our products directly with most of our customers  certain purchase orders for our products are received from contract manufacturers on behalf of several of our network systems vendor customers following our direct negotiation with the respective customers 
we participate in vmi programs with certain of our customers  whereby we maintain an agreed upon quantity of certain products at a customer designated warehouse 
revenue pursuant to the vmi programs is recognized when the products are physically pulled by the customer  or its designated contract manufacturer  and put into production 
simultaneous with the inventory pulls  purchase orders are received from the customer  or its designated contract manufacturer  as evidence that a purchase request and delivery have occurred and that title has passed to the customer at a previously agreed upon price 
we sell certain of our products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost or the issuance of credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  ranging from one year to five years 
we accrue the estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
our management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or as other information becomes available 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based upon historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable and actual write off history  as well as assessment of customers creditworthiness 
changes in the financial condition of customers could have an effect on the allowance balance required and result in a related charge or credit to earnings 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  including inventory consigned to our customers and our contract manufacturers 
inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items which are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value 
estimates of realizable value are based upon management s analyses and assumptions  including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
we typically use a twelve month rolling forecast based on factors including  but not limited to  our production cycles  anticipated product orders  marketing forecasts  backlog  shipment activities and inventories owned by us but part of vmi programs and held at customer locations 
if market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates  we may require additional inventory write downs 
if demand is higher than expected  inventories that had previously been written down may be sold at prices in excess of the written down value 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and 
table of contents liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
as of march   the company has us federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately   and  respectively  to offset future taxable income 
the us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards each include approximately  of pre acquisition losses that are subject to certain annual limitations under section of the internal revenue code and comparable provisions of state tax law 
the us federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  and and and  respectively 
during the year ending march   us state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively  will expire if unused 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at march  and  management considered recent operating results  the near term earnings expectations  and the highly competitive nature of our markets in making this assessment 
at the end of each of the respective years  management determined that it was more likely than not that the full tax benefit of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
accordingly  full valuation allowances have been provided against the net deferred tax assets 
there can be no assurance that deferred tax assets subject to our valuation allowance will ever be realized 
impairment of long lived assets impairment of long lived assets are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in estimating future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other groups 
assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties 
our evaluations for the years ended march   and indicated that there were no impairments 
goodwill and business combinations goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we account for acquisitions in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations 
sfas no 
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a two step impairment test is required to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then the goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
based upon the impairment analyses performed during the year ended march   we recorded aggregate write downs of goodwill of million attributable to the previously completed acquisitions of stratalight and pine 
goodwill was  million and million at march   and  respectively 

table of contents stock based incentive plans sfas no 
r  share based payment requires all equity based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
we adopted sfas no 
r on april   using the modified prospective method 
this method requires compensation cost for the unvested portion of awards that are outstanding as of march  to be recognized over the remaining service period based on the grant date fair value of those awards as previously calculated for pro forma disclosures under statement no 
all new awards and awards that are modified  repurchased  or cancelled after march  are accounted for under the provisions of statement no 
r 
compensation expense for all employee stock based plans was million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we estimate the fair value of our share based awards utilizing the black scholes pricing model 
the fair value of the awards is amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value calculations involve significant judgments  assumptions  estimates and complexities that impact the amount of compensation expense to be recorded in current and future periods 
the factors include the time period our stock based awards are expected to remain outstanding has been determined based on the average of the original award period and the remaining vesting period in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin simplified method 
our expected term assumption for awards issued during the years ended march   and was years  years and years  respectively 
as additional evidence develops from our option activity  the expected term assumption may be refined to capture more relevant trends 
through december   the future volatility of our stock was estimated based on the median calculated value of the historical volatility of companies believed to have similar market performance characteristics to ours 
use of comparable companies was necessary during this period since we did not possess a sufficient stock price history 
subsequent to december   we estimated volatility based on our historical stock prices 
the expected volatility assumption for awards issued during the years ended march   and was  and  respectively 
a dividend yield of zero has been assumed for awards issued during the years ended march   and based on our actual past experience and the fact that we do not anticipate paying a dividend on our shares in the near future 
we have based our risk free interest rate assumption for awards issued during the years ended march   and on the implied weighted average yields of  and  respectively  available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent expected term 
forfeiture rates for awards issued during the years ended march    and have been estimated based on our actual historical forfeiture trends of approximately over their expected terms 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and sales and expenses during the periods reported 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
these estimates include assessment of the ability to collect accounts receivable  the use and recoverability of inventory  the realization of deferred tax assets  expected warranty costs  fair value of stock awards  purchased tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in business combinations  and estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization periods of tangible and intangible assets  among others 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and the estimates will change under different assumptions or conditions

total sales increased million  or  to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march   primarily as a result of million of sales of stratalight products  higher sales volumes of communication products and a million increase from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  net of the impact of decreases in average selling prices 
for the year ended march   sales of our gbps and lower products increased million  or  to million  while sales of our gbps products increased million  or  to million 
sales of our industrial and commercial products remained constant at million 
the increase in sales of our gbps and lower products primarily resulted from increased demand for our xfp and pin tunable products  partially offset by lower demand for our xenpak and pin fixed wavelength modules 
sales of our gbps products increased primarily as a result of our acquisition of stratalight 
for the years ended march  and  two customers  cisco and alcatel lucent  together accounted for and of sales  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of total sales 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased million  or  to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march   principally attributable to a million increase in excess and obsolete inventory charges  including a million charge to discontinue certain early generation gbps multimode fibre products  and million attributable to unfavorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations partially offset by a million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange forward contracts 
additional costs associated with the stratalight acquisition that were incurred during the year ended march  include a million charge attributable to purchase price accounting adjustments for inventory sold during 
table of contents the period  million of developed product technology amortization expense and million of employee liquidity bonus plan expense 
during the years ended march  and  we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march  the decrease primarily resulted from reduced average selling prices of most products  higher charges for excess and obsolete inventory  higher per unit costs associated with lower sales volumes and the negative effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates net of hedging programs  partially offset by lower material and outsourcing costs per unit  improved product mix and higher relative margins from sales of stratalight products

the increase in selling  general and administrative costs also was attributable to higher employee costs  higher stock based compensation expense  defense costs associated with a class action lawsuit and higher bad debt costs associated primarily with the nortel  inc bankruptcy 
the stock based compensation expense associated with selling  general and administrative employees was million and million during the years ended march  and  respectively 
impairment of goodwill 
as part of the annual assessment of goodwill completed during the fourth quarter ended march   there were significant indicators to conclude that an impairment of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of stratalight on january  may have occurred 
this conclusion was based on the significant decrease in our market capitalization and a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment from the time of the acquisition announcement on july  through march  we concluded in the impairment analysis that the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the stratalight acquisition exceeded its fair value 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter ended march  which represented the full amount of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition 
during the three month period ended december   there were sufficient indicators to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis  including a significant decrease in our market capitalization and a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment largely caused by the widespread unavailability of business and consumer credit 
based upon the interim goodwill analysis conducted  an impairment was indicated and we recorded a million charge  which represented the full amount of goodwill recorded in connection with the pine acquisition 
acquired in process research and development 
we incurred million of in process research and development expenses for the year ended march  related to the stratalight acquisition 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles related to the acquisition of stratalight was million for the year ended march  the amortization consisted of million related

the decrease primarily reflects the decline in interest rates over the respective periods 
other expense income  net 
other expense  net was million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively  and consisted primarily of net exchange losses on foreign currency transactions 
income taxes because of the uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of our future profitability  we have recorded a valuation allowance to offset potential income tax benefits associated with our operating losses and other net deferred tax assets 
during the year ended march   we recorded a  current income tax expense attributable to income earned in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
in other tax jurisdictions we generated operating losses and recorded a valuation allowance to offset potential income tax benefits associated with these operating losses 
during the year ended march   we did not record a tax provision in certain tax jurisdictions as the income tax benefits from our net operating loss carryforwards were used to offset the related income tax 
for those tax jurisdictions continuing to generate operating losses  we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset potential income tax benefits associated with these operating losses 
there can be no assurance that deferred tax assets subject to our valuation allowance will ever be realized
