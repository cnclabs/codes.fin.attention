overview we developed  market and sell the hi art system  an advanced and versatile radiation therapy system for the treatment of a wide variety of cancers 
the hi art system combines integrated ct imaging with radiation therapy to deliver radiation treatment with speed and precision while reducing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissue which  we believe  can lead to improved patient outcomes 
we market and sell the system to hospitals and cancer treatment centers in north america  europe  the middle east and asia pacific and offer customer support services in each region either directly or through distributors 
for the years ended december  and  our revenue was million and million  respectively  a decrease of 
we believe that a combination of the current global economic downturn  the ongoing credit crisis  our transition in sales leadership and enhanced competitive pressure resulted in fewer hi art systems being installed and accepted in versus our net loss for the year ended december  was million  and our net income for the year ended december  was million 
the decreased profitability in was primarily caused by the sale of fewer systems  continued investments in our service operations and a charge of million related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
although our revenue decreased from the prior year and we experienced a net loss  we remain in a strong capital position with million of cash and short term investments as of december  thus  we are readily able to fund ongoing operations and to invest in future product offerings 
our total assets decreased to million at december  from million at december   a decrease of million or  which is primarily attributable to reduced cash balances and the establishment of the aforementioned deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
in an effort to conserve our cash resources  we are carefully monitoring our ongoing expenditures  as was evidenced by a decrease in operating expenses during the fourth quarter versus and by our december reduction in staff 
during  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of chengdu twin peak accelerator technology inc twin peak  a privately held company based in chengdu  china  for consideration of approximately million 
we believe that twin peak could be a lower cost alternative and secondary source of supply for linear accelerators  a critical component of the hi art system 
because of the current volatile state of the global economy  especially as it is related to capital equipment manufacturers  and because of continued market competition  we expect our financial performance to be somewhat similar to like  we expect the year to be somewhat back end loaded with only to of our revenue expected to be generated during the first half of the year 
furthermore  because of our planned 
table of contents cash conservation efforts  we expect to use only a marginal amount of cash during  thus maintaining our sound financial position 
despite near term economic challenges  we remain optimistic about our long term financial performance 
this is based on continued growth in market demand for image guided radiation therapy equipment  our new senior sales management  our expected release of product enhancements in the future and our revenue backlog of million as of december  factors affecting our financial performance our financial performance is significantly affected by the following factors incoming orders since we sell high priced capital equipment with a long sales cycle and an approximate month window between customer order and delivery  an important measure of our future financial performance is the dollar value of incoming orders for equipment 
during  we experienced a decline in incoming orders as compared to we believe that this decline resulted from a combination of the current global economic downturn  the ongoing credit crisis  our transition in sales leadership and increased competitive pressure 
since the hi art system is a major capital expenditure  our customers may require funding through a credit facility or lease arrangement  and they may have increased difficulty obtaining the necessary credit in the current economic environment 
in addition  the current economic environment may cause potential new customers to delay placing capital equipment orders or to purchase equipment that is less costly 
in the last few months  some united states orders we expected to close have not been placed  which we believe might be the result of concerns about economic conditions 
we experienced increased competition in the marketplace during  which we believe has created some market confusion 
we intend to improve our sales competitiveness by selectively increasing sales force coverage and by expanding product features  as evidenced by our recently announced plans to launch tomodirect software  in order to open more market opportunities 
furthermore  we believe continued innovation and expansion of our clinical capabilities will extend our technology leadership position and increase our prospects for greater market share and continued growth 
during  we terminated the distribution agreement with our former japanese distributor  resulting in a stoppage of incoming orders from japan 
effective january   we entered into a distributorship agreement with hitachi medical corporation hitachi to distribute the hi art system in japan 
japan is the second largest market in the world for radiation therapy equipment 
we believe that hitachi will help revitalize the japanese market for us and create growth in market share 
during the second half of  we restructured our global sales management to enhance our sales execution capabilities 
with our new sales management team  we believe that we have strengthened our ability to drive sales performance and increase market share 
backlog as of december   we had a backlog of million  the majority of which should convert to revenue within the next months 
we define backlog as the total contractual value of all firm orders received for the hi art system and related options that have installation sites identified and that we believe are likely to ship within months 
to be included in backlog  such orders must be evidenced by a signed quotation or purchase order from the customer 
on a regular basis  we review our open orders to determine if they meet our backlog definition 
as a result of this process  we removed a significant number of orders from our backlog during the year ended december  reasons for these removals included uncertainty regarding customer project sites  customer shipment schedules  customer economic issues  the timing of shipments to our japanese distributor and competitive losses of 
table of contents two customers 
as a result of our new process for tracking orders that we implemented in the second quarter of  we believe that we have improved accuracy in determining backlog and predicting the timing of shipments 
revenue the majority of our revenue is generated from sales of the hi art system 
we negotiate the actual purchase price with each customer  and  historically  the purchase price has varied significantly across geographic regions 
because of the current unstable global economy and increased competition  we expect our revenue to be similar to our revenue 
however  based on continued growth in market demand for image guided radiation therapy equipment  our new senior sales management  our growing number of service contracts  our revenue backlog as of december  and our expected release of product enhancements in the future  we are optimistic about our revenue growth beyond our revenue projections can be impacted by a number of factors  including the following shipments of the hi art system generally occur to months after the order is received 
timing of deliveries can be affected by factors out of our control such as construction delays at customer project sites and customer credit issues 
we generally recognize revenue from a system sale upon customer acceptance  which usually occurs three to four weeks after delivery 
each installation represents a significant percentage of our revenue for a particular quarter 
our geographic mix of customers may impact our average selling prices 
increased sales of the hi art system outside of north america have tended to favorably impact our gross margins due to higher average selling prices in these markets 
we intend to continue to expand our international selling efforts  although we cannot be certain that favorable pricing trends will continue nor can we be certain of how foreign currency exchange rates will impact our financial results in the future 
our ability to demonstrate the clinical benefits of the hi art system compared to competing systems is a factor in our ability to influence the market demand for the hi art system 
to compete effectively  we may need to offer additional features that could require substantial internal resources to develop 
our focus on sales to for profit  multi center customers in the united states may require us to lower selling prices  as these customers tend to be more price conscious 
in addition  we have a limited history of working with these for profit  multi center customers 
orders from these customers may remain in backlog longer than those from customers who place single unit orders  as units sold to multi center customers tend to install sequentially over a longer period of time 
the hi art system is a major capital equipment item that represents a significant purchase for most of our customers 
if the global economy continues its downward trend  our customers may choose to delay some of their capital spending  and  as a result  our incoming orders and subsequent revenue recognition may be materially adversely affected 
also included in our revenue are sales of optional equipment and software enhancements purchased by our end customers 
because we plan to further develop the hi art system by adding upgraded features  we expect to experience continued revenue growth from optional equipment and software enhancements 
service revenue 
our service revenue is generated primarily from post warranty service contracts and the sale of service spare parts 
our service contracts may be purchased with one year or multiple year terms  giving our customers the option to contract for the level of support they desire 
currently  our most popular service plan is our total tlc service package  or total tlc 
under total tlc  we provide customers with full spare parts coverage  including installation service by our field service engineers  and full planned maintenance 
we recognize service contract revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
we recognize revenue from spare parts  primarily sold to our distributors  upon shipment 
as the number of installed systems continues to grow  we expect to experience growth in our revenue from post warranty service contracts 
also  we intend to offer various levels of service  which we believe will ultimately enhance our revenue and profitability 

table of contents our ability to execute these strategies to increase incoming orders  to increase backlog with high quality orders  to increase sales of optional equipment and software enhancements and to grow our service revenue will have a direct impact on our ability to increase overall revenue in the future 
if we are unable to execute these strategies  we may generate revenue at levels that are similar to or lower than those we have generated in the past 
cost of revenue cost of revenue includes all our manufacturing and service costs 
it consists of material  labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacture of the hi art system 
it also includes the cost of shipping the system to the customer site  installation costs  warranty provision and royalty payments to wisconsin alumni research foundation warf  a related party 
finally  cost of revenue includes the customer support and service infrastructures required to service and repair the equipment during the warranty and service contract periods 
in future periods  we expect to improve our gross margins through the following initiatives component supply and cost 
our cost of revenue has been impacted by high component costs and higher replacement rates than we originally anticipated  resulting in increased warranty expense and negative profit margins on various service contracts 
we are developing alternate components and implementing enhancements to increase the performance of components used in the hi art system 
we are also seeking to identify lower priced components of comparable or improved performance and quality  as well as making engineering improvements to the hi art system in order to reduce costs 
we believe that achieving these goals should result in reduced manufacturing and service support costs in the long term 
service and support expenses 
we continue to have a number of individual service contracts that produce negative gross profit margins  and we have recorded a reserve for the related estimated future losses 
however  our average direct service costs per site are beginning to decrease 
we expect to continue to improve service contract margins by leveraging our fixed service infrastructure costs over a larger installed base  increasing the price for some of our older annual service contracts  training our personnel to improve their diagnostic capabilities and introducing component design changes  all of which should improve system performance and reduce overall service costs 
warranty 
our standard sales contract includes a warranty covering replacement components and service for a one year period 
we record a reserve to cost of revenue at the time of revenue recognition for the expected cost of warranty claims based on our historical experience 
we believe that our warranty provision can be reduced in the future if our initiatives to reduce service and support costs succeed 
our ability to execute on these strategies to reduce customer support and service expenses  as well as component costs and failure rates  will have a direct impact on our ability to improve profitability in the future 
if we are unable to execute these strategies  we may experience margins that are similar to or lower than our past performance 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for research and development personnel who design and develop future products and product enhancements 
research and development also includes expenses associated with product design and development  customer research collaborations and fees to third parties who furnish services related to these activities 
we expect research and development expenses to decrease during  both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  because we have decreased the total number of employees performing research and development activities 
we plan to be more selective with our ongoing project spending by focusing on the highest priority projects 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salary and benefits for executive management  sales  marketing and other corporate functions 
also included in these expenses are travel  sales commissions  trade shows and marketing materials and expenses related to accounting  legal  tax and other consulting fees 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to remain relatively level during  both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue 
we also expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as our overall business grows in future years 
nonoperating expenses because we conduct business in numerous foreign jurisdictions  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our primary exposures are related to foreign currency denominated sales and expenses in europe 
we do not currently have a hedging program in place to offset these risks 
interest income since the completion of our initial public offering  we have invested our cash balances in a short term investment portfolio 
until recently  this has led to growing interest income 
we expect interest income to decline in due both to lower levels of investable cash and to a reduction in interest rates 
income tax expense benefit multiple taxing jurisdictions and projected financial earnings or losses 
we are subject to taxes on earnings in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required when evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for taxes on earnings 
as a result  our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in the numerous geographic locations in which we operate  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets  tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the geographic locations in which we operate  introduction of new accounting standards and changes in tax liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
during the fourth quarter of  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
the valuation allowance was established primarily due to our three year cumulative net taxable loss as of december   our projected taxable loss in  our decreased backlog and the challenging near term economic conditions 
as of september   we believed that there was a more likely than not possibility that our deferred assets would be recovered 
as a result of the valuation allowance  there will be no net federal tax benefit recorded against the losses that we expect to incur during noncontrolling interests our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of compact particle acceleration corporation cpac  our controlled  minority owned affiliate 
because we hold a call option on the medical technology from cpac and maintain overall control of its board of directors  for accounting purposes we are deemed to have a controlling interest in the entity 
since our ownership interest is less than  the outside stockholders interests are shown in our consolidated financial statements as noncontrolling interests 
if we obtain the third party funding we are seeking for cpac  we expect our ownership percentage to decline

this decrease was attributable to fewer hi art systems installed and accepted during the year ended december  versus the year ended december  also  during the year ended december   of our revenue was from international customers  and these sales generally carried higher average selling prices due to favorable exchange rates 
during the year ended 
table of contents december   only of our revenue was generated outside north america 
overall  average selling prices during decreased from those of service and other revenue increased million or between years 
this increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in service contract revenue  as more systems moved from warranty to service contract coverage 
there were more units covered by service contracts at december  as compared to december  the increase was also attributable to a million increase in turnkey revenue related to construction services managed for customers and was partially offset by a million decrease in spare parts and other service revenue 
no single customer accounted for more than of our revenue for the years ended december  or cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
overall  our gross margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the reduction in gross margin was primarily due to lower product revenue and higher service related expenses 
manufacturing costs per installed and accepted system increased by during compared to this increase was due mainly to fewer hi art systems installed and accepted during the year  and to increased costs related to raw materials  warranties and optional equipment 
total service and support costs increased by for compared to in general  the majority of this increase was attributable to the growth in the number of systems under service contracts and to the growth in our service infrastructure 
our service employee costs increased by approximately million  as we expanded the total number of employees engaged in our service operations  which include logistics  field service  call center operations  installation and site planning 
this was especially true in our field service organization  as employee costs increased million due to a growth in our installed base of systems compared to we also incurred additional travel and logistics costs of million in compared to as the installed base of systems grows  the number of service repair interventions also increases 
in addition  with the geographic spread of the installed base  we opened additional service parts depots to be closer to our customers 
also contributing to the overall increase was a million increase in costs associated with upgrading the installed base for component and software changes 
in addition  we incurred increased warranty expenses of million due to rising trends in our costs per warranty unit and to the extension of a few customer warranties 
finally  we incurred inventory write down expenses of million due mainly to an increase in service parts returned from the field and sent to vendors that have not yet been evaluated or repaired 
during  we made significant progress related to the financial performance of our service contracts 
we charge each service contract with the direct costs associated with performing service at the particular site  including direct labor  overhead  parts and freight 
mainly because of investments we made in training our personnel to improve their diagnostic capabilities and in redesigning certain system components  our average annual cost per service contract declined from we expect this trend to continue and to improve during  as we expect to better leverage our service operation costs over an increasing base of installed systems 
research and development expenses research and development expenses by category for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands years ended december  change change hi art r d proton project cpac r d 
table of contents total research and development expenses increased million or between years 
the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in expenses related to our proton therapy research project 
in and in the first quarter of  we funded this project directly through lawrence livermore national laboratory 
in april  cpac was established and subsequently incurred research and development expenses of million during the remainder of all other research and development activities increased by million between years  primarily due to million in additional employee costs  as in the second half of and early  we expanded the total number of employees engaged in research and development activities prior to our december reduction in staff 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or

in addition  we incurred a million increase in costs for outside services  including consulting  legal  tax and audit fees related to our international operations 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sec filing fees due to the initial public offering during the prior year and by a million decrease in commissions payable due to the lower volume of systems ordered or accepted during the period 
share based compensation share based compensation expense under statement of financial accounting standards no

this increase was attributable to the larger number of systems accepted  growth in the number of systems under service contract  growth in our service infrastructure and additional loss reserve on our existing service contracts 
to support this growth  our employee costs increased by approximately million due to an increase in the total number of employees engaged in our service operations  which include logistics  field service  call center operations  installation and site planning 
we also incurred additional travel and logistics costs of million due to a higher number of installed systems and additional service parts depots 
gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margins was due to increased system acceptances coupled with higher average selling prices on accepted systems which resulted in improved absorption of fixed manufacturing and service costs

we were in compliance with these covenants  and there were no amounts outstanding  at december  and contractual obligations and commitments the following table is a summary of our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payment due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations notes payable including interest twin peak acquisition payments minimum purchase agreement the table of contractual obligations and commitments does not include royalty payments payable to warf under our license agreement with warf  dated february   as amended 
under the license agreement  the amount of royalty payments due to warf is based on the number of units of the hi art system sold and therefore cannot be determined accurately in advance 
our royalty expenses under the license agreement are currently significantly in excess of minimum required payments and were million in  million in and million in the table of contractual obligations and commitments also does not include our unrecognized tax benefits related to fin no 
 which were million at december  we have never been a tax rate payer due to the existence of unutilized net operating losses  therefore  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of any adjustment to these unrecognized benefits 
further  any negative impact from future tax audits would not result in a cash liability until our net operating losses are utilized 
pending litigation on may  and june   two separate complaints  which were subsequently consolidated into a consolidated amended complaint on october   were filed against us  certain of our officers and all of our independent directors during the period in question 
the consolidated action alleges that the defendants violated the securities act with respect to statements made in connection with the initial and secondary public offerings of our common stock 
the plaintiffs also allege that the defendants violated federal securities laws by misrepresenting our projected financial outlook during the period may  through april  the plaintiffs seek to represent persons who purchased our securities between those dates and who were damaged as a result of the decline in the price of our stock  allegedly attributable to the financial misrepresentations 
the plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in an unspecified amount 

table of contents we believe that we have substantial legal and factual defenses to the claims and allegations contained in the complaints  and we intend to pursue these defenses vigorously 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
although we carry insurance for these types of claims  a judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we estimate that our potential loss will not exceed our insurance deductible of million 
we have recorded such amount as a liability 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following revenue generated by sales of the hi art system and service plans  costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities  the performance of the systems operating in the field and cost of maintaining those systems  the level of investment needed in our service and support infrastructure  costs of our research and development activities  and effects of competing technological and market developments 
the current state of the global economy is volatile and could have potentially negative effects on our near term liquidity and capital resources  including slower collections of receivables  delays of existing order deliveries and postponements of incoming orders 
however  we believe that our current cash and equivalents  along with the cash we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
at december   we were in a strong capital position with million of cash and short term investments 
for that reason  we do not expect to draw on our million line of credit nor do we expect to use significant amounts of our cash reserves for operating activities during the next months 
moreover  we are seeking to conserve our cash resources and are carefully monitoring our ongoing expenditures 
if our estimates of revenue  expenses  or capital or liquidity requirements change or are inaccurate  or if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or arrange additional debt financing 
in the future  we may also seek to sell additional equity or arrange debt financing to give us financial flexibility to pursue attractive acquisition or investment opportunities that may arise 
we may also seek to sell additional equity or arrange debt financing to provide us with additional financial flexibility if market opportunities exist 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized from system sales  including sales to distributors  and related services when earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
payments received for products or services prior to shipment or prior to completion of the related services are recorded as customer deposits 
once a hi art system has been shipped  the related deposits are transferred to deferred revenue until the criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied 
we recognize revenue in connection with distributor sales of the hi art system based on the distributor s certification status 
once a distributor is certified by us to provide installation  testing  training and post installation warranty services to end customers  we recognize revenue upon shipment to that certified distributor as we no longer have any obligations to the distributor or the end customer 
prior to a distributor achieving certification  we recognize revenue upon receipt of the signed acceptance procedure document from the end customer 
distributors do not have any contractual right of return  and we have not accepted any system returns from any distributor 
we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware  software enhancements  options and post warranty maintenance services 
judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements  the determination of whether the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical to ensure compliance with us gaap 
the ability to establish the fair value of those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue for each element based on the fair value of the element provided when all other criteria for revenue recognition for such element have been met 
the fair value for each element provided in multiple element arrangements is determined by referencing historical pricing policies when the element is sold separately 
revenue from the post warranty maintenance on the hi art system is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract  which generally ranges from twelve to thirty six months 
we sell optional software packages 
the selling price  cost and functionality of this software is incidental to the operation of the hi art system itself 
we recognize revenue for these optional software packages in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain agreements 
we recognize license revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and delivery of the product has occurred  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition under sop no 
have been met 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
in instances when evidence of vsoe of all undelivered elements exists  evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements and the fair value of all of the undelivered elements is less than the arrangement fee  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
therefore  to the extent that a discount exists  we attribute the discount entirely to the delivered elements 
we record all revenue net of any governmental taxes 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balance 
we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts  historical experience and other available evidence 

table of contents inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined by the first in  first out method 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand and existing product configurations 
our inventories may become obsolete due to the rapid technological change in our industry 
as changes to the hi art system are released  a determination must be made to identify any parts that are no longer useful 
if a part is determined to be obsolete  a reserve is recorded for the value of the inventory of such on hand 
we also forecast usage and compare this with the quantity of parts on hand 
if it is determined we have excess inventory  we establish a reserve for the excess 
warranty obligations we warrant the hi art system for a period of twelve months following customer acceptance 
we record a current liability for the expected cost of warranty obligations in cost of revenue at the time when each sale is recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate of the total costs that we expect to incur to repair or replace parts that fail while the system is under warranty 
we monitor warranty costs both to update the historical trend data and to determine if the accrued balance is sufficient to meet our outstanding warranty obligations 
the amount of our estimated warranty liability as of december  was approximately of the sales value of the hi art system and may be adjusted as our warranty costs incurred increase or decrease in the future 
income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

accordingly  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax laws combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
under the liability method specified by sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by the enacted tax rates 
during  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded a valuation allowance reserve against our net deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
the valuation allowance was established based on our three year cumulative net loss as of december  and our near term financial forecasts 
as a result  we believe that there is a more likely than not possibility that we will not be able to realize the net deferred tax assets during the foreseeable future 
therefore  there will be no net federal benefit recorded against the losses that we currently expect to generate in we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  as required by fin  which clarifies sfas no 
 we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
at the adoption date  we applied fin to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open 
the unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to federal and state research tax credits 
investments we account for investments in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date 
table of contents of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to our financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   our financial assets  which consisted of short term investments  were measured at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
employing level inputs 
investment in cpac our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of cpac  our controlled  minority owned affiliate 
we have consolidated cpac in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  arb no 
 as cpac is deemed to be a development stage enterprise  we hold a call option on certain medical technology of cpac and we maintain overall control of cpac s board of directors 
our ownership in cpac is less than  therefore  the outside stockholders interests are shown in the consolidated financial statements as noncontrolling interests 
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
share based compensation we account for share based payments in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock and employee stock purchase plans  to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statement of operations over the service period of the grant  which is generally the vesting period 
as permitted by sfas  prior to january   we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and for disclosure purposes the minimum value method 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method 
under the prospective method  only new awards or awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date are accounted for under the provisions of sfas r 
we selected the black scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model will be affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates  forfeitures and expected dividends 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is based on a simplified or plain vanilla approach as we do not feel our historical experience is reasonable or supportable 
in order to qualify for the simplified approach  staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
provides five criteria the stock option must meet 
our stock options meet those 
table of contents criteria  and therefore  we used this approach for all stock options granted in and in as we have only been operating as a public company since may   we do not feel that our common stock has established enough meaningful actual price volatility data 
therefore  we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on the volatility of the common stock of similar entities over the expected term of our stock options 
as such  because of the current unstable state of the global economy  we expect our estimated stock volatility calculation to be affected by the changing stock prices of these similar entities during the near term future 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and  therefore  use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use a forfeiture rate that is based on our past history of pre vesting forfeitures 
we had a choice of two attribution methods for allocating compensation costs under sfas no 
r the straight line method  which allocates expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the last separately vesting portion of an award  or the graded vesting attribution method  which allocates expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was  in substance  multiple awards 
we chose the straight line method and amortized the fair value of each option on a straight line basis over the service period 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  which represent our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
estimates of stock based compensation expenses are significant to our financial statements  but these expenses are based on the black scholes option pricing model and will not result in the payment of cash by us 
the application of sfas no 
r and sab no 
may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating earnings loss per share 
with respect to each option grant date  we determined the deemed fair value of our common stock 
prior to our initial public offering there was not a public market for our common stock 
therefore  the determination of fair value was necessarily subjective 
in making this determination  we considered a number of factors  including the issuance price of our series of preferred shares to third parties  recent third party transactions in our common stock  valuations performed by an independent valuation firm  the liquidation preference and other rights of the preferred shares  our revenue backlog and financial performance  trends in the market for public companies involved in similar lines of business  and the fact that the option grants involved illiquid securities of a private company 
we have reviewed the methodologies used in making these determinations in light of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  which we refer to as the practice aid 
we took into consideration the market and income approaches to valuation as set forth in the practice aid 
we believe that the valuation methodologies that we have used are consistent with the practice aid 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the period through our initial public offering date of may  and for the year ended december   we assessed the valuations of our common and preferred shares as of the applicable grant dates primarily by considering recent third party transactions in our 
table of contents common stock and the issuance price of our preferred stock in sales to third parties 
because all of such transactions were negotiated by the parties on an arms length basis  we determined that the prices paid in those transactions reflected a reliable determination of the fair value of our securities 
when no such recent stock activity occurred  we engaged an independent valuation firm  virchow krause valuation  llc virchow krause  to perform independent valuations of our common stock 
valuation methodologies employed by virchow krause the valuation methodologies employed by virchow krause in connection with the independent valuation studies were based on various generally accepted valuation methods 
specifically  at each valuation date virchow krause analyzed the value of our securities based on three potential scenarios a public offering  a sale or merger and remaining a private company 
in each of virchow krause s reports  each of these scenarios was analyzed using a different valuation methodology 
specifically  i valuation in connection with the public offering scenario was calculated by reference to the public market prices of companies in our industry or industries deemed by virchow krause to be similar  reviewing various valuation multiples implied by the trading prices of such companies  and applying those multiples to our financial performance  ii valuation in connection with the sale or merger scenario was calculated by reference to recent transactions involving businesses in our industry or industries determined by virchow krause to be similar  reviewing various valuation multiples implied by the prices in those transactions  and applying those multiples to our financial performance  and iii valuation in connection with the private company scenario was calculated using the discounted cash flow valuation method  applying a forecast of future cash flows determined by our management and virchow krause to be reasonable  an appropriate discount rate calculated to be our weighted average cost of capital and a residual value determined by capitalizing our stabilized cash flow 
in connection with its valuation as of december   virchow krause also considered the indicative valuations provided by investment banks in connection with the public offering scenario and the sale or merger scenario 
based on our assessment of our business and prospects as of december   virchow krause assigned a probability to the public offering scenario  a probability to the sale or merger scenario and a probability to the private company scenario 
following these analyses  virchow krause allocated the values so determined to our preferred stock and our common stock based on the economic impact of the conversion rights and liquidation preferences of the preferred stock  assigning probabilities to each of these events that varied depending upon our stage of development and our financial condition 
in making its valuations  virchow krause applied discounts based on a number of factors that it determined impacted the value of our common stock 
first  it applied a discount with respect to the sale or merger scenario and the private company scenario to reflect the fact that the common stock being valued did not represent a controlling interest in our company 
second  it applied a discount to reflect the lack of marketability of our common stock 
as of march   the discount applied for each of the lack of control and the lack of marketability was 
as of december   no discount was applied for either factor due to the increased likelihood of an initial public offering or a sale or merger 
third  virchow krause applied a discount to reflect the lesser rights of the common stock compared to the preferred stock 
as of march   the discount applied was  and as of december   the discount applied was  reflecting the increased probability of an exit event that would result in conversion of the preferred stock 
finally  for the december  valuation it applied a discount of with respect to the public company scenario to reflect the fact that an initial public offering was not expected to occur until june  in addition  for each valuation report virchow krause reviewed our historical financial performance  conducted a visit of our facilities and interviewed our management concerning our business and its prospects 
virchow krause also researched our industry  customers  competitors  suppliers and prospects  and analyzed the economic outlook of the industry and the communities in which we operate 
determining the fair value of our common stock involves complex and subjective judgments involving estimates of revenue  earnings  assumed market growth rates and estimated costs  as well as appropriate discount rates 
at the time of each valuation  the significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow approach included estimates of our revenue and revenue growth rates for several years into the future 
although each time we prepared such forecasts for use by virchow krause in the preparation of a valuation report  we did so based on assumptions 
table of contents that we believed to be reasonable and appropriate  there can be no assurance that any such estimates for earlier periods have come to pass or that any such estimates for future periods will prove to be accurate 
significant factors in determining the fair value as of each grant date the following table sets forth option grants made during number of options granted is in thousands number of fair value intrinsic options exercise estimated value date of grant granted price per share per share january may july october november december intrinsic value per share is the difference  as of the grant date  between the fair value estimate and the exercise price 
the major pricing factors which supported the valuations used at each of the grant dates were as follows on december   we sold  shares of series e convertible preferred stock at per share  representing net proceeds of million 
we engaged virchow krause to perform an independent valuation of our common stock based on this preferred stock transaction 
virchow krause determined that our common stock was valued at per share as of december  this valuation was then used for the option grants made in january in the second quarter of  our board of directors determined that an updated independent valuation should be obtained 
therefore  we engaged virchow krause to perform a valuation of all classes of our capital stock 
virchow krause issued a report dated may   which concluded that our common stock was valued at per share as of march  this valuation was then used for the option grants made in may and july we believe that there were no material events and no material changes in our financial condition or prospects during this period that would have resulted in a change in the valuation of a share of our common stock 
on october   the chairman of our board of directors  t 
rockwell mackie  sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock to two independent investors  and our then president  paul reckwerdt  sold  common shares to a single independent investor 
the purchase price of all these shares was per share resulting in aggregate proceeds of million to each seller 
given the significant size of the transactions and the fact that these shares were sold to independent third parties  we concluded that our common stock should be valued at per share as of october  both the buyers and sellers had knowledge of the possibility that we would undertake an initial public offering 
stock option grants were made based on this price in october and november management did not obtain an independent valuation report for the grants made on december  because management did not believe that there had been any material change in our financial condition or prospects between october  and december  however  after further consideration of an independent valuation study completed by virchow krause in march with respect to the fair value of our common stock as of december   management and our board of directors concluded that the stock options granted on december  were granted with an exercise price of per share less than the fair value of our common stock on december  as established by the december  valuation 
in all cases  the possibility of an initial public offering was factored into the valuation considerations 
in addition  the difference in value between the common stock and preferred stock narrowed as we moved closer to completing an initial public offering 

table of contents convertible preferred stock warrant liability effective january   we accounted for warrants that are exercisable into redeemable preferred shares issued in connection with financing arrangements in accordance with fsp pursuant to fsp  an evaluation of specifically identified conditions was made to determine whether the fair value of warrants issued was required to be classified as a liability 
the fair value of warrants classified as liabilities was adjusted for changes in fair value at each reporting period  and the corresponding non cash gain or loss was recorded in current period earnings 
we selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of warrants 
the determination of the fair value using this model was affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock volatility over the expected term of the warrant  risk free interest rates  and the estimated fair value of the underlying preferred stock 
the expected term used was equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants 
as we were operating as a private company from inception until our initial public offering date of may   we were unable to use our actual stock price volatility data 
therefore  we estimated the volatility of the underlying stock based on historical stock prices of companies which we consider to be members of our peer group 
historical price volatilities of these companies were evaluated over a period of time equal to the expected term of the warrants 
the risk free interest rates were based on us treasury zero coupon rates in effect at each reporting period with terms consistent with the expected term of the warrants 
the fair value of the underlying preferred stock at january  was determined based upon the sale by us of  shares of series e preferred stock at per share on december  and an independent third party valuation performed by virchow krause which allocated our enterprise value  determined based upon the sale of the series e preferred stock  to each of our existing classes of stock including the series a and d preferred stock 
the fair value of the underlying series a and d preferred stock at may  and december  was determined based upon an independent third party valuation performed by virchow krause 
the valuations  as of may  and december   were prepared utilizing the probability weighted expected return method as prescribed by the aicpa practice aid valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
these valuations took into consideration the following scenarios i completion of an initial public offering  ii sale or merger  and iii remaining private 
the valuation amounts determined under each scenario were then probability weighted based upon our management s best estimates of the occurrence of each scenario 
the resulting value was then allocated to our common stock and each series of our preferred stock based upon the economic impact of the conversion rights and liquidation preferences of the preferred stock 
redeemable convertible preferred stock prior to our initial public offering date of may   we had issued various classes of preferred stock 
the holders of series a  b  c and d preferred stock had the option to put their shares back to us at the greater of the original purchase price plus accrued dividends  or the current fair market value of the shares 
the holders of series e preferred stock had the option to put their shares back to us at the original purchase price plus accrued dividends 
as a result  the carrying value of the preferred stock had been increased by an accretion each period so that the carrying amounts would equal the greater of fair value or the defined redemption value for the series a  b  c and d preferred stock 
the series e preferred stock had been increased to its redemption value  including accrued dividends 
the accreted amounts were recorded to accumulated deficit 
the put option and the related accretion of the preferred shares terminated upon the closing of the initial public offering 
the fair value of the underlying preferred stock at january  and the fair value of the underlying series a and d preferred stock at december  were determined as described in convertible preferred stock warrant liability above 
on may   we completed our initial public offering and all issued and outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted to shares of our common stock 
in addition  all preferred stock accretion included in temporary equity at that time was reclassified to accumulated deficit
