as soon as our risk management department detects a problem  it works with the appropriate parties in an attempt to avoid a default or to minimize the claims that we may be obligated to pay on our policy 
loss mitigation can consist of restructuring the obligation  enforcing available security arrangements  working with the issuer to work through or to find alternatives mitigating the impact of management or potential political problems  when appropriate  exercising applicable rights to replace problem parties  and when appropriate  purchasing the insured obligation 
issuers typically are under no obligation to restructure insured transactions to prevent losses  but often will cooperate to avoid being associated with an obligation that experiences losses 
when appropriate  we discuss potential settlement options  either at our request or that of our counterparties  regarding particular obligations with appropriate parties 
on occasion  loss mitigation may include an early termination of our obligations  which could result in payments to or from us 
to determine the appropriate loss mitigation approach  we generally consider various factors relevant to such insured transaction  which may include the current and projected performance of the underlying obligation both on an expected case basis and stressed for more adverse performance and or market circumstances that we expect  the likelihood that we will pay a claim in light of credit deterioration and reductions in available payment reserves and existing subordination  our total exposure to the obligation  expected future premium payments from the credit  and the cost to us of pursuing mitigation remedies

risk management a 
mortgage insurance risk management our mortgage insurance business has a comprehensive risk management function which includes a risk originations group that consists of individual risk managers aligned with our lender customers as well as portfolio management and credit analytics functions that operate across the mortgage insurance business 
the mortgage insurance risk management function is responsible for overall credit policy creation  compliance monitoring  portfolio management  limit setting and communication of credit related issues to management and our board of directors 

table of contents risk origination risk management mortgage insurance understanding our business partners and customers is a key component of managing risk 
individual risk managers are assigned to specific lender accounts and perform ongoing business level due diligence to understand a lender s strengths and weaknesses in originating mortgage credit risk 
this information allows the individual risk managers to customize credit policy to address lender specific performance issues 
portfolio management risk management mortgage insurance portfolio management oversees the allocation of economic capital within our mortgage insurance business 
this group establishes the portfolio limits for product type  loan attributes  geographic concentration and counterparties and also is responsible for distribution of risk using risk transfer mechanisms such as captive reinsurance or the smart home arrangements discussed below under reinsurance ceded 
portfolio management surveillance 
the surveillance function is responsible for monitoring the performance of various risks in our mortgage portfolio 
the analysis performed by surveillance is used by the credit analytics and risk analytics functions where it is incorporated into the development of credit policy and the development of our proprietary default and prepayment models 
portfolio management valuation 
the valuation function is responsible for analyzing the current composition of our mortgage insurance portfolio and monitoring its compliance with our risk parameters as established by our board of directors 
this analysis involves analyzing risks to the portfolio from the market eg  the effects of changes in home prices and interest rates and analyzing risks from particular lenders  products  and geographic locales 
credit analytics risk management mortgage insurance credit analytics is responsible for establishing and maintaining all mortgage related credit risk policy involving risk acceptance  counterparty  portfolio  operational and structured risks secured by or involving mortgage collateral 
credit analytics also is responsible for establishing insurable risk guidelines for product types and loan attributes 
risk analytics risk management mortgage insurance risk analytics is responsible for all modeling functions in our mortgage insurance business 
risk analytics estimates  implements and controls our proprietary prophet models used in pricing our flow rate cards and structured transactions 
our proprietary prophet models jointly estimate default and prepayment risk on all of our major product lines 
risk analytics also reviews and approves all third party models used to approve loans for delegated mortgage insurance 
risk analytics is also responsible for the economic capital model and raroc pricing tools  and builds and updates the reserve model for the mortgage insurance portfolio and oversees economic research 
reinsurance ceded risk management mortgage insurance we use reinsurance in our mortgage insurance business as a capital and risk management tool 
smart home 
in  we developed an approach  referred to as smart home  for reinsuring risk associated with non prime mortgages and riskier products 
these reinsurance transactions effectively transfer risk from our portfolio to investors in the capital markets 
each transaction begins with the formation of an unaffiliated  offshore reinsurance company 
we then enter into an agreement with the smart home reinsurer to cede to the reinsurer a portion of the risk and premium associated with a portfolio of loans  consisting mostly of non prime residential mortgages  insured by us 
the 
table of contents smart home reinsurer is funded in the capital markets through the issuance to investors of a series of separate classes of credit linked notes 
each class relates to the loss coverage levels on the reinsured portfolio and is assigned a rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies 
we typically retain the risk associated with the first loss coverage levels  and we may retain or sell  in a separate risk transfer agreement  the risk associated with the aaa rated or most remote coverage level 
holders of the smart home credit linked notes bear the risk of loss from losses that would be paid to us under the reinsurance agreement 
the smart home reinsurer invests the proceeds of the notes in high quality short term investments approved by the rating agencies 
income earned on those investments and a portion of the reinsurance premiums that we pay are applied to pay interest on the notes as well as certain of the smart home reinsurer s expenses 
the rate of principal amortization of the credit linked notes is intended to approximate the rate of principal amortization of the underlying mortgages 
between august and may  we completed four smart home reinsurance transactions 
details of these transactions aggregated as of the initial closing of each transaction and as of december  are as follows initial as of december  pool of mortgages par value billion billion risk in force par value billion billion notes sold to investors risk ceded principal amount million million at december   approximately of our primary risk in force was included in smart home reinsurance transactions  compared to approximately at december  in these transactions  we reinsured the middle layer risk positions  while retaining a significant portion of the total risk comprising the first loss and most remote risk positions 
ceded premiums written and earned related to smart home for were each million  compared to million and million  respectively  for and million and million  respectively  for ceded losses related to smart home were million in and million in there were no ceded losses in ceded losses related to smart home are expected to continue to increase in most actual cash recoveries are not expected until and later 
captive reinsurance 
we and other companies in the mortgage insurance industry participate in reinsurance arrangements with mortgage lenders commonly referred to as captive reinsurance arrangements 
under captive reinsurance arrangements  a mortgage lender typically establishes a reinsurance company that assumes part of the risk associated with the portfolio of that lender s mortgages insured by us on a flow basis as compared to mortgages insured in structured transactions  which typically are not eligible for captive reinsurance arrangements 
in return for the reinsurance company s assumption of a portion of the risk  we cede a portion of the mortgage insurance premiums paid to us to the reinsurance company 
we currently have active captive reinsurance agreements in which new business continues to be placed 
we also currently have captive reinsurance arrangements operating on a run off basis  meaning that no new business is being placed in these captives 
this compares to active and run off captives as of december  in most cases  the risk assumed by the reinsurance company is an excess layer of aggregate losses that would be penetrated only in a situation of adverse loss development 
until recently  losses under most captive reinsurance arrangements have not approached a level requiring payment to us 
however  during the current housing and related credit market downturn in which losses have increased significantly  many captive reinsurance arrangements have attached  requiring our captive reinsurers to make payments to us 
we began recording ceded losses recoverable from such captives in the fourth quarter of  which accelerated throughout  although most cash recoveries are not expected until and later 
we believe that captive reinsurance is likely to serve as a significant source of reinsurance recoveries for us in future periods 
ceded 
table of contents losses related to captives in and were million and million  respectively 
we also offer  on a limited basis  quota share captive reinsurance arrangements under which the captive reinsurance company assumes a pro rata share of all losses in return for a pro rata share of the premiums collected 
because of many factors  including the incentives for mortgage lenders to funnel relatively higher quality loans through their captive reinsurers due to the risk sharing feature  we continue to evaluate the level of revenue sharing to risk sharing on a customer by customer basis as part of our customer profitability analysis 
we believe that all of our captive reinsurance arrangements transfer risk to the captive reinsurer 
we also believe that captive reinsurance agreements are important in aligning our interests with those of the lenders by providing lenders with an ongoing stake in the outcome of the lending decision 
in february  freddie mac and fannie mae announced that effective june   they would limit the percentage of premiums that mortgage insurers may cede to captives to of the mortgage insurance premiums paid to the mortgage insurer 
as a result  the terms of all of our captive reinsurance arrangements that ceded an amount greater than were amended to comply with these limitations 
we and other mortgage insurers have faced private lawsuits alleging  among other things  that our captive reinsurance arrangements constitute unlawful payments to mortgage lenders under the anti referral fee provisions of the real estate settlement practices act of respa 
we and other mortgage insurers also have been subject to inquiries from the new york insurance department  the minnesota department of commerce and the us department of housing and urban development hud relating to our captive reinsurance arrangements 
for more information  see regulation federal regulation respa below 
premiums ceded to captive reinsurance companies in on first lien mortgage insurance were million  representing of total first lien mortgage insurance premiums earned  as compared to million  or in primary new insurance written in on first lien mortgage insurance that had captive reinsurance associated with it was billion or of our total first lien primary new insurance written  as compared to billion  or of our total first lien primary new insurance written in these percentages have been volatile as a result of increases or decreases in the volume of structured transactions  which are not typically eligible for captive reinsurance arrangements 
some private mortgage insurers have elected not to enter into new captives going forward and have placed their existing captives into run off 
others  including us  have not yet made this determination  and we continue to evaluate our use of captives in light of our overall mortgage insurance business strategy 
however  in light of the significant number of our captives currently in run off  we expect amounts ceded to captives to decline significantly in gse arrangements 
we also have entered into risk revenue sharing arrangements with the gses whereby the primary insurance coverage amount on certain loans is recast into primary and pool insurance and our overall exposure is reduced in return for a payment made to the gses 
ceded premiums written and earned for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  under these programs 
other reinsurance 
certain states limit the amount of risk a mortgage insurer may retain on a single loan to of the indebtedness to the insured 
radian guaranty currently uses reinsurance from affiliated companies to remain in compliance with these insurance regulations 
see regulation state regulation reinsurance below 
b 
financial guaranty risk management in insuring our current financial guaranty portfolio  we employed a comprehensive risk system 
this system incorporated the integration of company wide risk management policies and processes as well as best practices of the financial guaranty industry 
all transactions were subject to a thorough underwriting analysis and a comprehensive risk committee decision process 
transaction underwriting included an analysis of all credit and legal aspects as well as any specific risks that may be inherent in the transaction 
further  we utilized our proprietary internal economic capital model for risk 
table of contents analysis  valuation and as the basis for calculating raroc on our financial guaranty business 
all transactions were subject to a credit committee decision process embedded in the financial guaranty business 
our risk management department uses internal ratings in monitoring our insured transactions 
we determine our internal ratings for a transaction  by utilizing all relevant information available to us  including periodic reports supplied by the issuer  trustee or servicer for the transaction  publicly available information regarding the issuer  the transaction  the underlying collateral or asset class of the transaction and or collateral  communications with the issuer  trustee  collateral manager and servicer for the transaction  and when available  public or private ratings assigned to our insured transactions or to other obligations that have substantially similar risk characteristics to our transactions without the benefit of financial guaranty or similar credit insurance 
when we deem it appropriate  we also utilize nationally recognized rating agency models and methodologies to assist in such analysis 
we use this information to develop an independent judgment regarding the risk and loss characteristics for our insured transactions 
if public or private ratings have been used  our risk management analysts express a view regarding the rating agency opinion and analysis 
when our analyses of the transaction results in a materially different view of the risk and loss characteristics of an insured transaction  we will assign a different internal rating than that assigned by the rating agency 
our rating scale is comparable to that of the nationally recognized rating agencies s p and moody s 
our use of internal ratings rather than rating agency ratings  results in a decrease in the percentage of our insured obligations rated aaa  an increase in the percentage of our insured obligations rated aa  a and bbb and a slight increase in the percentage of obligations rated below investment grade 
our internal ratings estimates are subject to revision at any time and may differ from the credit ratings ultimately assigned by the rating agencies 
see loss management financial guaranty above for information regarding our risk management department 
vi 
customers a 
mortgage insurance customers the principal customers of our mortgage insurance business are mortgage originators such as mortgage bankers  mortgage brokers  commercial banks  savings institutions and credit unions 
this is the case even though individual mortgage borrowers generally incur the cost of primary mortgage insurance coverage 
we also offer lender paid mortgage insurance  in which the mortgage lender or loan servicer pays the mortgage insurance premiums 
the cost of the mortgage insurance is then generally passed through to the borrower in the form of higher interest rates 
in  approximately of our mortgage insurance was originated on a lender paid basis  compared to approximately in this lender paid business is highly concentrated among a few large mortgage lending customers 
to obtain primary mortgage insurance from us  a mortgage lender must first apply for and receive a master policy 
our approval of a lender as a master policyholder is based  among other factors  on our evaluation of the lender s financial position and demonstrated adherence to sound loan origination practices 
the number of individual primary mortgage insurance policies in force at december   was  compared to  at december  and  at december  our mortgage insurance business depends to a significant degree on a small number of lending customers 
our top mortgage insurance customers  measured by primary new insurance written  were responsible for of our primary new insurance written in  compared to in and in the largest single mortgage insurance customer including branches and affiliates  measured by primary new insurance written  accounted for of new insurance written during  compared to in and in 
table of contents challenging market conditions during and have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the financial condition of a number of our largest lending customers 
these customers may become subject to serious liquidity constraints that could jeopardize the viability of their business plans or their access to additional capital  forcing them to consider alternatives such as bankruptcy or  as has occurred recently  consolidation with others in the industry 
see risk factors because our mortgage insurance business is concentrated among a few significant customers  our new business written and franchise value could decline if we lose any significant customer 
b 
financial guaranty customers we have historically conducted our structured finance business with many of the major global financial institutions that structure  underwrite or trade securities issued in structured finance obligations 
these institutions typically are large commercial or investment banks that focus on high quality deals in the public finance and structured finance markets 
while our public finance customers have historically included many of the same financial institutions as our structured finance business  our public finance customers have also included regional financial institutions and issuers that may focus on lower investment grade obligors or obligations 
as a reinsurer of financial guaranty obligations  we have traditionally maintained close and long standing relationships with most of the primary financial guaranty insurers 
we believe that these relationships have provided us with a comprehensive understanding of the market and of the financial guaranty insurers underwriting guidelines and reinsurance needs 
our financial guaranty reinsurance customers have consisted mainly of the largest primary insurance companies licensed to write financial guaranty insurance and their foreign based affiliates  including ambac assurance corporation ambac  financial security assurance inc fsai and financial guaranty insurance company fgic 
vii 
sales and marketing a 
mortgage insurance sales and marketing we employ six national account managers  who focus on the largest mortgage lenders  as well as a mortgage insurance field sales force of approximately persons  organized into four divisions  that provides local sales representation throughout the us each of the four divisions is supervised by a divisional sales manager who is directly responsible for several regional sales managers 
the divisional sales managers are responsible for managing the profitability of business in their regions  including premiums  losses and expenses 
the regional sales managers are responsible for managing a sales force in different areas within the region 
in addition  there are several account managers that manage specific accounts within a region that are not national accounts  but that need more targeted oversight and attention 
mortgage insurance sales personnel are compensated by salary  commissions on new insurance written and an incentive component based on the achievement of various goals 
viii 
competition a 
mortgage insurance competition we compete directly with six other private mortgage insurers genworth financial inc  mgic  pmi mortgage insurance co  republic mortgage insurance company  cmg mortgage insurance company and united guaranty corporation some of which are subsidiaries of larger companies with stronger financial strength ratings 
we also compete against various federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies  principally the federal housing administration fha  the veteran s administration va and state sponsored mortgage insurance funds 
while the mortgage insurance industry has not had new entrants in many years  it is possible that the increased credit quality of new loans being insured in the current market combined with the deterioration of the financial strength ratings of existing mortgage insurance companies  in part due to their legacy books of insured mortgages  could encourage new entrants 

table of contents governmental and quasi governmental entities typically do not have the same capital requirements that we and other mortgage insurance companies have  and therefore  may have greater financial flexibility in their pricing and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
in the event that a government owned or sponsored entity in one of our markets decides to reduce prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit motive  we may be unable to compete in that market effectively  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the fha  which until recently was not viewed by us as a significant competitor  substantially increased its market share in  including by insuring loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines at a cost to the borrower that is lower than the cost of our insurance 
recent federal legislation and programs have provided the fha with greater flexibility in establishing new products and have increased the fha s competitive position against private mortgage insurers 
see regulation federal regulations indirect regulation below 
we compete for flow business with other private mortgage insurance companies on the basis of both service and price 
the service based component includes risk management services  timeliness of claims payments  loss mitigation efforts and management and field service organization and expertise 
in the past  we have competed for structured transactions with other mortgage insurers and have competed with capital market executions such as senior subordinated security structures for this business 
competition for this business generally is based both on price and on the percentage of a given pool of loans that we are willing to insure 
in the past  we also have faced competition from a number of alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance  including mortgage lenders structuring mortgage originations to avoid private mortgage insurance  mostly through loans or other forms of simultaneous second loans  investors using other forms of credit enhancement such as credit default swaps or securitizations as a partial or complete substitute for private mortgage insurance  and mortgage lenders and other intermediaries that forego third party insurance coverage and retain the full risk of loss on their high ltv loans 
recently  competition from these alternatives has significantly diminished as a result of the recent housing market decline and credit market turmoil 
in particular  the recent poor performance of subprime loans  which made up a significant portion of capital market securitizations  has all but eliminated the secondary market for mortgage collateral other than with the gses 
ix 
ratings s p and moody s each rate the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries 
the rating agencies mainly focus on the following factors capital resources  financial strength  franchise value  commitment of management to  and alignment of stockholder interests with the insurance business  demonstrated management expertise in our insurance business  credit analysis  systems development  risk management  marketing  earnings volatility  capital markets and investment operations  including the ability to raise additional capital  if necessary  and capital sufficient to meet projected growth and capital adequacy standards 
as part of their ratings process  s p and moody s test our insurance subsidiaries by subjecting them to a stress level scenario in which losses over a stress period are tested against our capital level 
determinations of ratings by the rating agencies also are affected by macroeconomic conditions and economic conditions affecting the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty industries in particular  changes in regulatory conditions  competition  underwriting and investment losses 
the financial strength rating assigned by the rating agencies to an insurance company is based on factors relevant to policyholders and is not intended to protect that company s equity holders or creditors 
a financial strength rating is neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security 
financial strength ratings are an indication to an insurer s customers of the insurer s present financial strength and its capacity to honor its future claims payment obligations

we had requested that fitch withdraw these ratings in september  following fitch s downgrade of radian group and our financial guaranty subsidiaries 
recent ratings actions moody s on june   moody s lowered its senior debt rating on radian group to ba from a and its insurance financial strength ratings on radian guaranty and amerin guaranty to a from aa in downgrading our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  moody s cited deterioration in our insured portfolio  including nims and second liens 
moody s further stated that our ability to retain our status as an eligible mortgage insurer with the gses will continue to be an important ratings consideration for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries 
moody s lowered its insurance financial strength rating on radian insurance to baa two notches below radian guaranty from aa as a result of the higher risk nature of its insured portfolio of second liens and nims and the fact that radian insurance is no longer strategically important to our overall mortgage insurance business 
also on june   moody s lowered its insurance financial strength ratings on radian asset assurance and raal to a from aa  citing the likelihood that radian asset assurance will cease writing new business going forward and the possible diversion of capital from radian asset assurance to support our mortgage insurance business 
on october   moody s placed its ratings for radian group and each of our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty subsidiaries on review for possible downgrade 
in taking this ratings action  moody s cited its expectation of further stress on the risk adjusted capital position of our mortgage insurance business in light of continued deterioration in certain housing market fundamentals 
on february   moody s downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of radian guaranty and amerin guaranty to ba from a and the rating of radian insurance to b from baa moody s also downgraded the senior debt rating of radian group to b from ba according to moody s  these downgrades reflect significant stress on the risk adjusted capital position of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries due to the weak economic environment and continued deterioration in housing fundamentals  which moody s expects to result in significantly higher losses for our mortgage insurance business 
moody s also considered the continued pressure on our profitability and constraints on our financial flexibility in the current market environment 
moody s also cited its belief that the mortgage insurance business model has deteriorated due to on going losses and the relative weakness of the gses 

table of contents recent ratings actions s p on august   s p lowered its senior debt rating on radian group to bb from bbb and its insurance financial strength ratings on radian guaranty and amerin guaranty to bbb from a 
in lowering its ratings for radian group and our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  s p cited the significant operating losses incurred by our mortgage insurance business as well as s p s reassessment of the mortgage insurance industry s long term fundamentals 
s p also cited radian group s financial flexibility as a potential concern 
s p also lowered its insurance financial strength ratings for our financial guaranty subsidiaries to bbb from a 
s p stated that it had lowered the ratings for these entities based on the diminished business prospects for our financial guaranty business and our intention to use this business to provide capital support to our mortgage insurance business 
on december   s p placed its ratings on radian group and our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries on creditwatch with negative implications 
s p has indicated that it will resolve the creditwatch status of the ratings in two stages 
first  it will re evaluate its estimate of mortgage insurers net loss costs for their insured portfolios based on deterioration in macroeconomic conditions  partially offset by greater anticipated benefits of reinsurance 
the second stage will be a thorough sector wide review that incorporates operating results for the fourth quarter of and developments in macroeconomic conditions  which s p anticipates completing in march on december   s p announced the results of the first stage of its evaluation and radian group s rating was downgraded to bb  but its ratings for the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries were unchanged 
the ratings for radian group and our mortgage and financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries remain on creditwatch with negative implications while s p performs the second stage of its analysis  which it expects to complete in march and which could result in a substantial downgrade 
our current ratings and the threat of further ratings actions could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
see risk factors we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise

we review our investment portfolio on at least a quarterly basis for declines in the fair value of securities below the amortized cost basis of such securities that are considered to be other than temporary 
if the fair value of a security is below the cost basis  and it is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value through earnings as a realized loss and the fair value becomes the new basis

regulation a 
state regulation regulation we and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive  detailed regulation principally designed for the protection of policyholders  rather than for the benefit of investors  by the insurance departments in the various states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business 
insurance laws vary from state to state  but generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business 
insurance regulations address  among other things  the licensing of companies to transact business  claims handling  reinsurance requirements  premium rates and policy forms offered to customers  financial statements  periodic reporting  permissible investments and adherence to financial standards relating to surplus  dividends and other criteria of solvency intended to assure the satisfaction of obligations to policyholders 
our insurance subsidiaries premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which the insurers are licensed to transact business 
these regulations are intended to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition 
table of contents in the insurance marketplace 
in most states  premium rates and policy forms must be filed and  in some states approved  before their use 
changes in premium rates may be subject to justification  generally on the basis of the insurer s loss experience  expenses and future trend analysis

the contingency reserve may be drawn on under specified but limited circumstances with approval of the superintendent of the new york insurance department 
radian asset assurance and other financial guaranty insurers in the us are generally restricted to writing financial guaranty insurance 
each insurance subsidiary is required by its state of domicile and each other jurisdiction in which it is licensed to transact business and to make various filings with those jurisdictions and with the national 
table of contents association of insurance commissioners  including quarterly and annual financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination by the insurance departments of each of the states in which they are licensed to transact business 
given the recent significant losses incurred by many mortgage and financial guaranty insurers  our insurance subsidiaries have been subject to heightened scrutiny by insurance regulators 
we are currently in close communication with certain insurance regulatory authorities  including the pennsylvania insurance department with respect to radian guaranty and radian insurance  the illinois division of insurance regarding amerin and the texas department of insurance regarding the commonwealth mortgage assurance company of texas cmac of texas  which reinsures a portion of radian guaranty s portfolio 
amerin  which insures second lien mortgages  is not currently writing any new business and is currently prohibited from writing new insurance business in four states without prior approval 
additionally  the hong kong insurance authority has directed radian insurance to continue to maintain sufficient assets in hong kong to cover its potential liabilities on insured loans in hong kong 
in light of current market conditions and on going deterioration in our financial condition  insurance departments in the jurisdictions noted above or in other jurisdictions could impose restrictions or requirements that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses 
insurance holding company regulation regulation state regulation radian group is an insurance holding company and our insurance subsidiaries belong to an insurance holding company system 
all states have enacted legislation regulating insurance companies in an insurance holding company system 
these laws generally require the insurance holding company to register with the insurance regulatory authority of each state in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and to furnish to this regulator financial and other information concerning the holding company and its affiliated companies within the system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of insurers within the system 
because we are an insurance holding company  and because radian guaranty and radian insurance are pennsylvania insurance companies  amerin guaranty is an illinois insurance company  cmac of texas and radian mortgage insurance inc each an operating subsidiary used primarily for intra company reinsurance are texas and arizona insurance companies  respectively  and radian asset assurance is a new york insurance company  the pennsylvania  texas  arizona  illinois and new york insurance laws regulate  among other things  certain transactions in our common stock and certain transactions between us  our insurance subsidiaries and other parties affiliated with us 
specifically  no person may  directly or indirectly  offer to acquire or acquire control of radian group  unless that person files a statement and other documents with the commissioners of insurance of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and each commissioner s prior approval is obtained 
similarly  no person may directly or indirectly  offer to acquire or acquire control of any of our insurance subsidiaries without first obtaining the approval of the commissioner of insurance of the state where the target insurance company is domiciled 
the commissioner may hold a public hearing on the matter 
in addition  material transactions between us  our insurance subsidiaries and our affiliates are subject to certain conditions  including that they be fair and reasonable 
these restrictions generally apply to all persons controlling or who are under common control with us or our insurance subsidiaries 
certain transactions between us or our affiliates and our insurance subsidiaries may not be entered into unless the applicable commissioner of insurance is given days prior notification and does not disapprove the transaction during that day period 
dividends regulation state regulation radian guaranty and radian insurance 
radian guaranty s and radian insurance s ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain provisions of the insurance laws of pennsylvania 
under pennsylvania s insurance laws  dividends and other distributions may only be paid out of an insurer s unassigned surplus  measured as of the end of the prior fiscal year  unless the pennsylvania insurance commissioner approves the payment of dividends or other distributions from another source 
radian guaranty and radian insurance each had negative unassigned 
table of contents surplus at december  of million and million  respectively 
in addition  in the event a insurer had positive unassigned surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year  without the prior approval of the pennsylvania insurance commissioner  an insurer only may pay dividends or other distributions during any month period in an aggregate amount less than or equal to the greater of i of the preceding year end statutory policyholders surplus  or ii the preceding year s statutory net income 
due to the negative unassigned surplus at the end of  no dividends or other distributions can be paid from radian guaranty or radian insurance in without approval from the pennsylvania insurance commissioner 
neither radian guaranty nor radian insurance paid any dividends in amerin 
amerin guaranty s ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain provisions of the insurance laws of illinois 
the insurance laws of illinois establish a test limiting the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid from unassigned surplus by an insurer without prior approval by the illinois insurance commissioner 
under this test  amerin guaranty may only pay dividends during any month period in an aggregate amount less than or equal to the greater of i of the preceding year end statutory policyholders surplus  or ii the preceding year s statutory net income 
in accordance with this test  amerin guaranty was not permitted absent prior regulatory approval to pay dividends in and will not be permitted to pay dividends in without prior regulatory approval 
radian asset assurance 
radian asset assurance s ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain provisions of the insurance laws of new york 
under the new york insurance laws  radian asset assurance may only pay dividends from earned surplus 
without the prior approval from the new york superintendent of insurance  radian asset assurance can only pay a dividend  which when totaled with all other dividends declared or distributed by it during the preceding months  is the lesser of of its surplus to policyholders as shown by its last statement on file with the superintendent of insurance  or of adjusted net investment income 
radian asset assurance paid million in dividends in  which was subsequently contributed to radian guaranty in july at december   radian asset assurance did not have any funds available for dividends that could be paid prior to june without prior regulatory approval 
risk to capital regulation state regulation a number of states in which we write mortgage insurance limit a private mortgage insurer s risk in force to times the total of the insurer s policyholders surplus  plus the statutory contingency reserve 
this is commonly known as the risk to capital requirement 
as a result of net losses during and  radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio grew from to at december  to to as of december  and to to at december   even after including the contribution of our financial guaranty business to our mortgage insurance business during the third quarter of this contribution added approximately million in statutory capital to our mortgage insurance business 
additional losses in our mortgage insurance portfolio without a corresponding increase in new capital or capital relief could further negatively impact this ratio  which could limit radian guaranty s ability to write new insurance and could increase restrictions and requirements placed on radian guaranty by the gse s or state insurance regulators 
see risk factors recent losses in our mortgage insurance business have reduced radian guaranty s statutory surplus and increased radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio  additional losses in our mortgage insurance portfolio without a corresponding increase in new capital or capital relief could further negatively impact these ratios  which could limit radian guaranty s ability to write new insurance and could increase restrictions and requirements placed on radian guaranty by the gses or state insurance regulators 
reserves regulation state regulation for statutory reporting  mortgage insurance companies are required annually to provide for additions to their contingency reserve in an amount equal to of earned premiums 
such amounts cannot be released into surplus for a period of years  except when loss ratios exceed  in which case the amount above can be released under certain circumstances 
the contingency reserve  designed to be a reserve against catastrophic 
table of contents losses  essentially restricts dividends and other distributions by mortgage insurance companies 
we classify the contingency reserve as a statutory liability 
at december   radian guaranty had statutory policyholders surplus of million and a contingency reserve of billion  amerin guaranty had a statutory policyholders surplus of million and radian insurance had statutory policyholders surplus of million 
in march  radian group contributed million to amerin guaranty 
our financial guaranty business also is required to establish contingency reserves 
the contingency reserve on direct financial guaranty business written is established net of reinsurance  in an amount equal to the greater of of premiums written or a stated percentage based on the type of obligation insured or reinsured of the net amount of principal guaranteed  ratably over to years depending on the category of obligation insured 
the contingency reserve may be released with regulatory approval to the extent that losses in any calendar year exceed a pre determined percentage of earned premiums for such year  with the percentage threshold dependent upon the category of obligation insured 
such reserves may also be released  subject to regulatory approval in certain instances  upon demonstration that the reserve amount is excessive in relation to the outstanding obligation 
the contingency reserve on assumed reinsurance business is provided by the ceding company 
at december   radian asset assurance had statutory policyholders surplus of million and a contingency reserve of million 
reinsurance regulation state regulation restrictions apply under the laws of several states to any licensed company ceding business to an unlicensed reinsurer 
under those laws  if a reinsurer is not admitted  authorized or approved in such state  the company ceding business to the reinsurer cannot take credit in its statutory financial statements for the risk ceded to the reinsurer without compliance with certain reinsurance security requirements 
the state of california and the national association of insurance commissioners mortgage guaranty insurance model act limit the amount of risk a mortgage insurer may retain with respect to coverage on an insured loan to of the principal balance of the insured loan 
coverage in excess of ie  deep coverage must be reinsured 
radian guaranty currently uses reinsurance from affiliated companies such as cmac of texas to remain in compliance with these insurance regulations 
accreditation regulation state regulation the national association of insurance commissioners instituted the financial regulatory accreditation standards program  known as frasp  in response to federal initiatives to regulate the insurance business 
frasp provides standards intended to establish effective state regulation of the financial condition of insurance companies 
frasp requires states to adopt certain laws and regulations  institute required regulatory practices and procedures  and have adequate personnel to enforce these items in order to become accredited 
in accordance with the national association of insurance commissioners model law on examinations  accredited states are not permitted to accept certain financial examination reports of insurers prepared solely by the insurance regulatory agencies of non accredited states 
although the state of new york is not accredited  no state where radian asset assurance is licensed has refused to accept the new york insurance department s reports on examination for radian asset assurance 
we cannot be certain that  if the new york insurance department remains unaccredited  other states that are accredited will continue to accept financial examination reports prepared solely by the new york insurance department 
we do not believe that the refusal by an accredited state to continue accepting financial examination reports prepared by the new york insurance department would have a material adverse affect on our insurance businesses

federal regulation regulation mortgage insurance tax deductibility regulation federal regulation on december   federal legislation was enacted making mortgage insurance premiums tax deductible with regard to loans closing on or after january  originally scheduled to expire at the end of  the legislation was extended for three more years in december as part of the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of the legislation allows borrowers with adjusted gross incomes of  or less  in the case of a married individual filing a separate return to deduct the full amount of their mortgage insurance premiums paid in calendar years through borrowers making between  and  will be eligible to write off a portion of the premiums paid in those years 
as extended  the legislation applies to loans closing on or after january  through december   and to both purchase and refinance transactions 
real estate settlement practices act respa regulation federal regulation the origination or refinance of a federally regulated mortgage loan is a settlement service  and therefore  subject to respa 
in december  regulations were issued stating that mortgage insurance also is a settlement service 
as a result  mortgage insurers are subject to the anti referral provisions of section a of respa  which provide  in essence  that mortgage insurers are prohibited from paying anything of value to a mortgage lender in consideration of the lender s referral of business to the mortgage insurer 
although many states prohibit mortgage insurers from giving rebates  respa has been interpreted to cover many non fee services as well 
hud  as well as the insurance commissioner or an attorney general of any state  may conduct investigations  levy fines and other sanctions or enjoin future violations of respa 
we and other mortgage insurers have faced private lawsuits alleging  among other things  that our captive reinsurance arrangements  as well as pool insurance and contract underwriting services  constitute unlawful payments to mortgage lenders under respa 
although to date we have successfully defended against all such lawsuits on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing  we cannot be certain that we will have continued success defending against similar lawsuits 
the insurance law provisions of many states  including new york  also prohibit paying for the referral of insurance business and provide various mechanisms to enforce this provision 
in february  the new york insurance department issued circular letter no 
that discusses its position concerning various transactions between mortgage guaranty insurance companies licensed in new york and mortgage lenders 
the letter confirms that captive reinsurance transactions are permissible if they constitute a legitimate transfer of risk and are fair and equitable to the parties 
the letter also states that supernotes performance notes  dollar pool insurance  and un captive captives violate new york insurance law 
in may  we received a letter from the new york insurance department seeking information related to all of the captive mortgage reinsurance arrangements that we entered into since january   a list of the lenders associated with each captive along with each captive s state of domicile and capital surplus requirements 
the letter also included a request for a description of any other arrangements through which we provide any payment or consideration to a lender in connection with mortgage insurance 
we submitted our response and affirmed it as true under penalties of perjury to the new york insurance department in june we are aware that other mortgage insurers received similar requests from the new york insurance department 
in february  we and other mortgage insurers received a second letter from the new york insurance department seeking documentation and a description of the due diligence that we perform in selecting reinsurers for our mortgage insurance risk 
the letter indicated that the new york insurance department is seeking evidence from us to rebut the assertion that the premiums we pay under our captive reinsurance arrangements constitute an inducement or compensation to lenders for doing business with us and to bolster a claim that it is difficult or impossible to obtain mortgage reinsurance from non captive reinsurers 
we submitted a response to the new york insurance department for radian guaranty in march and for amerin guaranty in may  as requested 
we have had no further inquiries from the insurance department about either company with respect to captive reinsurance 

table of contents in addition to the new york inquiry  we and other mortgage insurers recently have been subject to inquiries from the minnesota department of commerce relating to our captive reinsurance and contract underwriting arrangements  and we have also received a subpoena from the office of the inspector general of hud  requesting information relating to captive reinsurance 
we are in the process of responding to both of these requests 
public reports have indicated that both the colorado and north carolina insurance commissioners also were considering investigating or reviewing captive mortgage reinsurance arrangements 
insurance departments or other officials in other states may also conduct such investigations or reviews 
we cannot predict whether these inquiries will lead to further inquiries  or further investigations of these arrangements  or the scope  timing or outcome of the present inquiries or any other inquiry or action by these or other regulators 
although we believe that all of our captive reinsurance and contract underwriting arrangements comply with applicable legal requirements  we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend against any alleged violations of respa or other laws 
see risk factors legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our mortgage insurance business 
hud proposed an exemption under respa for lenders that  at the time a borrower submits a loan application  give the borrower a firm  guaranteed price for all the settlement services associated with the loan  commonly referred to as bundling 
in  hud indicated its intention to abandon the proposed rule and to submit a revised proposed rule to the us congress 
hud began looking at the reform process again in and a new rule was proposed in we do not know what form  if any  this rule will take or whether it will be promulgated 
in addition  hud has also declared its intention to seek legislative changes to respa 
we cannot predict which changes will be implemented and whether the premiums we are able to charge for mortgage insurance will be negatively affected 
home mortgage disclosure act of hmda regulation federal regulation most originators of mortgage loans are required to collect and report data relating to a mortgage loan applicant s race  nationality  gender  marital status and census tract to hud or the federal reserve under the hmda 
the purpose of the hmda is to detect possible discrimination in home lending and  through disclosure  to discourage this discrimination 
mortgage insurers are not required pursuant to any law or regulation to report hmda data  although under the laws of several states  mortgage insurers are currently prohibited from discriminating on the basis of certain classifications 
several mortgage insurers  through the trade association mortgage insurance companies of america mica  entered into an agreement with the federal financial institutions examinations council ffiec to report the same data on loans submitted for insurance as is required for most mortgage lenders under hmda 
reports of hmda type data for the mortgage insurance industry have been submitted by several mortgage insurers through mica to the ffiec since we are not aware of any pending or expected actions by governmental agencies in response to the reports submitted by mica to the ffiec 
we have been independently reporting hmda data to the ffiec since january  but now expect to submit hmda through mica as a result of our rejoining this trade group in mortgage insurance cancellation regulation federal regulation the homeowners protection act of the hpa was signed into law on july  the hpa imposes certain cancellation and termination requirements for borrower paid private mortgage insurance and requires certain disclosures to borrowers regarding their rights under the law 
the hpa also requires certain disclosures for loans covered by lender paid private mortgage insurance 
specifically  the hpa provides that private mortgage insurance on most loans originated on or after july   may be canceled at the request of the borrower once the ltv reaches  provided that certain conditions are satisfied 
private mortgage insurance must be canceled automatically once the ltv reaches or  if the loan is not current on that date  on the date that the loan becomes current 

table of contents the hpa establishes special rules for the termination of private mortgage insurance in connection with loans that are high risk 
the hpa does not define high risk loans but leaves that determination to fannie mae and freddie mac for loans up to the conforming loan limit and to the lender for any other loan 
for high risk loans above the conforming loan limit  private mortgage insurance must be terminated on the date that the ltv is first scheduled to reach 
in no case  however  may private mortgage insurance be required beyond the midpoint of the amortization period of the loan if the borrower is current on the payments required by the terms of the mortgage 
freddie mac and fannie mae regulation federal regulation as the largest purchasers and sellers of conventional mortgage loans  and therefore  the main beneficiaries of private mortgage insurance  the gses impose requirements on private mortgage insurers who wish to insure loans sold to the gses 
the current eligibility requirements impose limitations on the type of risk insured  standards for the geographic and customer diversification of risk  procedures for claims handling  standards for acceptable underwriting practices  standards for certain reinsurance cessions and financial requirements that generally mirror state insurance regulatory requirements 
these requirements are subject to change from time to time 
some of the gses more recent programs require less insurance coverage than they historically have required  and they have the ability to further reduce coverage requirements 
they also have the ability to implement new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers and to alter or liberalize underwriting standards on low down payment mortgages they purchase  alter the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law  require private mortgage insurers to perform activities intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages that are in default  and influence a mortgage lender s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage 
in order to maintain the highest level of eligibility with the gses  mortgage insurers historically had to maintain an insurer financial strength rating of aa or aa from at least two of the three rating agencies by which they are customarily rated 
if a mortgage insurer were to lose such eligibility  the gses could restrict the mortgage insurer from conducting certain types of business with them  or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by the mortgage insurer 
in light of the housing market downturn that has adversely affected mortgage insurers  both of the gses have indicated that loss of eligibility due to such a mortgage insurer downgrade will no longer be automatic and will be subject to review if and when the downgrade occurs 
the gses have programs that allow for lower levels of required mortgage insurance coverage for certain low down payment  year fixed rate loans approved through their automated underwriting systems 
under these programs  the gses replace a portion of their standard mortgage insurance coverage with a reduced layer of coverage 
the gses require that we participate in affordable housing programs that they maintain to provide for loans to low and moderate income borrowers 
these programs usually include s  s and s  and may require the liberalization of certain underwriting guidelines to achieve the programs objectives 
our default experience on loans that we insure through these programs has been worse than on non affordable housing loans  but the risk in force attributable to our participation in these programs is immaterial 
in july  an overhaul of regulatory oversight of the gses was enacted 
the new provisions  contained within the housing and economic recovery act hera  encompass substantially all of the gses operations 
this new law abolished the former regulator for the gses and created a new  stronger regulator  the fhfa  in addition to other oversight reforms 

table of contents in september  the fhfa was appointed as the conservator of the gses 
as their conservator  the fhfa controls and directs the operations of the gses 
the appointment of a conservator may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the gses will be changed in ways that may have a material adverse effect on us 
in particular  if the private mortgage insurance industry does not have the ability  due to capital constraints  to continue to write sufficient business to meet the needs of the gses  the gses may seek alternatives other than private mortgage insurance to conduct their business 
the appointment of a conservator also increases the likelihood that the us congress will examine the role and purpose of the gses in the domestic housing market and potentially make certain structural and other changes to the gses 
although we believe that private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future structure involving the gses  there is a possibility that new federal legislation could reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the gses as credit enhancement or eliminate the requirement altogether 
the gses have recently introduced streamlined loan modification programs intended to assist qualifying borrowers whose loans are in default 
we have agreed to the terms of these programs with both gses 
further  in connection with the recently announced homeownership affordability and stability plan  the government announced a new program that is intended to provide homeowners who took out conforming loans owned or guaranteed by the gses to refinance through these institutions over time 
under this program  the fhfa will allow the gses to refinance their own qualifying loans without mortgage insurance if the original loan does not have mortgage insurance 
the us treasury also has developed uniform guidance for loan modifications to be used by all federal agencies and the private sector 
the gses are now required to use these guidelines for loans that they own or guaranty 
see indirect regulation below 
indirect regulation regulation federal regulation we also are indirectly  but significantly  impacted by regulations affecting originators and purchasers of mortgage loans  such as the gses  and regulations affecting governmental insurers such as the fha and the va 
we and other private mortgage insurers may be significantly impacted by federal housing legislation and other laws and regulations that affect the demand for private mortgage insurance and the housing market generally 
in october  the federal banking regulators office of the comptroller of the currency  treasury occ  board of governors of the federal reserve system board  federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  office of thrift supervision  treasury ots  and national credit union administration ncua issued joint interagency guidance on non traditional mortgage loans 
the guidance was developed to address what the regulators identified as the risks associated with the growing use of mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer payment of principal and  sometimes  interest 
while the guidance does not have a legally binding effect on lenders  the provisions are used by federal bank examiners to determine whether regulated institutions are in compliance with recommended underwriting and risk management practices 
as a result  lenders often are influenced to adjust their business practices in order to conform to currently prevailing guidance 
the guidance includes a focus on tightening underwriting and credit standards for non traditional loans 
simultaneous second lien loans which in the past have been utilized in lieu of mortgage insurance are among the factors cited in the guidance as a risk factor when used in conjunction with non traditional loan features 
the guidance cites the use of mortgage insurance as a mitigating factor for lenders to reduce risk in non traditional loan products 
in february  the economic stimulus act of was enacted  which raised loan limits for fha insured loans as well as the limit on gse conforming loans in certain areas up to a maximum of  the increase in the gses conforming loan limits was intended to increase the size of the secondary market for purchasing and securitizing home loans and to encourage the gses to continue to provide liquidity to the residential mortgage market  particularly in higher priced areas  at a time when many banks and similar institutions had seriously curtailed their activities due to the subprime lending crisis that developed and intensified during the latter half of 
table of contents the hera contains provisions intended to provide the fha with greater flexibility in establishing new products 
under hera  the maximum loan amount that the fha can insure was increased and a higher minimum cash down payment was established 
the hera also contained provisions  called the hope for homeownership program  in which the fha is authorized to refinance distressed mortgages in return for lenders and investors agreeing to write down the amount of the original mortgage 
in october  the emergency economic stabilization act eesa was enacted 
this act includes provisions that require the secretary of the us treasury to encourage further use of the hope for homeowners program 
under eesa  the secretary is required to maximize assistance to homeowners and encourage mortgage servicers to take advantage of available programs including the hope for homeowners program to minimize foreclosures 
the secretary also is authorized to use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to facilitate loan modifications to prevent avoidable foreclosures 
the recently announced homeowner affordability and stability plan also includes provisions that encourage further use of the hope for homeowners program and further strengthen support for fha programs by easing restrictions in these programs 
we cannot predict with any certainty the long term impact of these changes upon demand for our products 
however  we believe the fha has materially increased its market share in  in part by insuring a number of loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines  as a result of these recent legislative and regulatory changes 
see risk factors our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition 
during  mortgage industry participants implemented programs to modify troubled residential mortgages 
in particular  bank of america and countrywide financial corporation entered into a settlement with various states attorneys general that requires the creation of a proactive home retention program that is intended to systematically modify troubled mortgages to allow for up to billion in interest rate and principal reductions for nearly  countrywide customers 
in addition  the fdic in its role as conservator for indymac bank  also has implemented broad modification procedures for its servicers 
under the recently announced homeowner affordability and stability plan  the us treasury plans to allocate billion to support a homeowner stability initiative aimed at reducing foreclosures and avoiding further depreciation in overall home prices 
as part of this program  the us treasury intends to work with financial institutions to reduce interest rates on qualifying mortgages  including those that are current  to specified affordability levels 
as discussed above in this section under freddie mac and fannie mae  the us treasury also has announced a comprehensive refinancing program through the gses 
the various initiatives intended to support homeownership and to mitigate the impact of the current housing downturn could have a significant positive effect on moving the domestic housing towards recovery 
however  many of the programs are in their early stages and it is unclear at this point whether they will provide us with a material benefit 
see risk factors loan modification and other similar programs may not provide us with a material benefit

foreign regulation regulation we also are subject to certain regulation in various foreign countries  namely the united kingdom  hong kong and bermuda  as a result of our operations in those jurisdictions 
in australia  our transactions have consisted solely of off shore reinsurance  consequently  we are not subject to direct regulation by the relevant australian authorities 
in the united kingdom  we are subject to regulation by the financial services authority fsa 
the fsa periodically performs a formal risk assessment of insurance companies or groups carrying on business in the united kingdom 
after each risk assessment  the fsa will inform the insurer of its views on the insurer s risk profile 
this will include details of any remedial action that the fsa requires 
the fsa also supervises the management of insurance companies through the approved persons regime  by which any appointment of persons to perform certain specified controlled functions within a regulated entity  must be approved by the fsa 

table of contents in addition  the fsa supervises the sale of general insurance  including payment protection insurance and mortgage insurance 
under fsa rules  persons who are involved in the sale of general insurance including insurers and distributors are prohibited from offering or accepting any inducement in connection with the sale of general insurance that is likely to conflict materially with their duties to insureds 
although the rules do not generally require disclosure of broker compensation  the insurer or distributor must disclose broker compensation at the insured s request 
the fsa has extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of an insurance company or authorized person and has the power  among other things  to enforce  and take disciplinary measures in respect of  breaches of its rules 
under fsa rules  insurance companies must maintain a margin of solvency at all times  the calculation of which in any particular case depends on the type and amount of insurance business a company writes 
our united kingdom subsidiaries are prohibited from declaring a dividend to their shareholders unless they have profits available for distribution 
the determination of whether a company has profits available for distribution is based on its accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses 
the acquisition of control of any united kingdom insurance company will require fsa approval 
for these purposes  a party that controls a united kingdom insurance company includes any company or individual that together with its or his associates directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a united kingdom authorized insurance company or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or its parent company 
in considering whether to approve an application for approval  the fsa must be satisfied that the acquirer is both a fit and proper person to have such control and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by such acquisition of control 
failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against our united kingdom subsidiaries by the fsa 
by reason of radian insurance s authorization  in september  to conduct insurance business through a branch in hong kong  we also are subject to regulation by the hong kong insurance authority hkia 
the hkia s principal purpose is to supervise and regulate the insurance industry  primarily for the protection of policy holders and the stability of the industry 
hong kong insurers are required by the insurance companies ordinance to maintain minimum capital as well as an excess of assets over liabilities of not less than a required solvency margin  which is determined on the basis of a statutory formula 
foreign owned insurers are also required to maintain assets in hong kong in an amount sufficient to ensure that assets will be available in hong kong to meet the claims of hong kong policy holders if the insurer should become insolvent 
the hkia also reviews the backgrounds and qualifications of insurance companies directors and key local management to ensure that these controllers are fit and proper to hold their positions  and has the authority to approve or disapprove key appointments 
in bermuda  we are subject to regulation by the bermuda monetary authority 
the insurance department within the monetary authority is responsible for the supervision  regulation  licensing and inspection of bermuda s insurance companies  pursuant to the insurance act of  as amended under the insurance amendment act of the insurance department has full licensing and intervention powers  including the authority to obtain information and reports and to require the production of documents from licensed insurers

basel ii capital accord regulation the basel ii capital accord represents a proposal by the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs  consisting of bank supervisors and central bankers from countries  to revise the international standards for measuring the adequacy of a bank s capital 
the implementation of the basel ii capital accord proposal will promote a more forward looking approach to capital supervision and ensure greater consistency in the way banks and banking regulators approach risk management around the world 
the implementation of the basel ii capital accord may affect the demand for and capital treatment provided to mortgage insurance and the capital available to large domestic and internationally active banking institutions for their mortgage origination and securitization activities 
our primary mortgage insurance business and opportunities may be significantly impacted by the implementation of the basel ii capital accord in the u 
s due to adoption of jurisdiction specific prudential standards  that may lead to change in demand for and acceptance of mortgage insurance by large domestic and internationally active banking institutions 
the implementation of the basel ii capital accord and adoption of standards is subject to the views and discretion of the local banking supervisors and its implementation is expected to vary across national jurisdictions 
we are continuously assessing the impact of basel ii capital accord implementation in the countries where we have significant operations 
basel ii was implemented by many banks in the us and many other countries in and may be implemented by the remaining banks in the us and many other countries in the basel ii provisions related to residential mortgages and mortgage insurance may provide incentives to certain of our bank customers not to insure mortgages having a lower risk of claim and to insure mortgages having a higher risk of claim 
see risk factors the implementation of the basel ii capital accord may discourage the use of mortgage insurance

employees at december   we had employees  of which work mainly for radian group  while and are employed in our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses  respectively 
approximately of our employees are contract underwriters that are hired on an as needed basis 
the number of contract underwriters can vary substantially from period to period  mainly as a result of changes in the demand for these services 
our employees are not unionized and management considers employee relations to be good 
item a 
risk factors 
we incurred significant losses during and  and we expect to incur significant losses in the amount of losses we incur on our insured products is subject to national and regional economic factors  many of which are beyond our control  including extended national or regional economic recessions  home price depreciation and unemployment  interest rate changes or volatility  deterioration in lending markets and other factors 
throughout  we experienced increased delinquencies and claims in our mortgage insurance business  primarily driven by the poor performance of our late through early books of business 
deterioration in general economic conditions  including a significant increase in unemployment  has increased the likelihood that borrowers will default on their mortgages 
in addition  home prices have continued to decline in many regions of the us falling home prices have increased the likelihood that borrowers with the ability to make their mortgage payments may voluntarily default on their mortgages when their mortgage balances exceed the value of their homes 
we also believe that some borrowers may voluntarily default to take advantage of certain loan modification programs currently being offered 
falling home prices also make it more difficult for us to mitigate our losses when a default occurs 
see our loss mitigation opportunities are reduced in markets where housing values fail to appreciate or begin to decline 

table of contents our financial guaranty portfolio also has been negatively impacted by deterioration in the credit markets and the overall economy 
see we have experienced deterioration in our financial guaranty portfolio below 
the current economic downturn and related disruption in the housing and credit markets is expected to continue during and possibly beyond 
we have incurred increased losses as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions and the amount of our new insurance written has declined  and we expect that these trends will continue to materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
a large portion of our mortgage insurance risk in force consists of higher risk loans  such as non prime and high ltv loans  and non traditional mortgage products  which have resulted in increased losses and are expected to result in further losses in the future 
non prime loans 
a large percentage of the mortgage insurance we wrote in years through and  consequently  our existing mortgage insurance risk in force  is related to non prime loans 
at december   our non prime mortgage insurance in force  including alt a  was billion or of our total primary insurance in force  compared to billion or of our primary insurance in force at december  and billion or of our primary insurance in force at december  historically  non prime loans are more likely to result in claims than prime loans 
in addition  our non prime business  in particular alt a loans  tends to have larger loan balances relative to other loans  which results in larger claims 
since  we have experienced a significant increase in mortgage loan delinquencies related to alt a loans originated in through these losses have occurred more rapidly and well in excess of historical loss patterns  and have contributed in large part to the significant increase in our provision for losses since if delinquency and default to claim rates on non prime loans continue to increase as is expected  in particular in california  florida and other states where the alt a product is prevalent  our results of operations and financial condition will continue to be negatively affected 
high ltv mortgages 
we generally provide private mortgage insurance on mortgage products that have more risk than most mortgage products that meet the gses classification of conforming loans 
a portion of our mortgage insurance in force consists of insurance on mortgage loans with ltvs at origination of or greater 
in  loans with ltvs in excess of accounted for billion or of our new primary mortgage insurance written  compared to billion or in and billion or in at december   our mortgage insurance risk in force related to these loans was billion or of our total primary risk in force  compared to billion or of primary insurance risk in force at december  and billion or of primary insurance risk in force at december  mortgage loans with ltvs greater than default substantially more often than those with lower ltvs 
in addition  when we are required to pay a claim on a higher ltv loan  it is generally more difficult to recover our costs from the underlying property  especially in areas with declining property values 
throughout and  we experienced a significant increase in mortgage loan delinquencies related to high ltv mortgages 
as a result  we have altered our underwriting criteria to eliminate insuring new loans with ltvs greater than 
we also have more stringent guidelines for loans with ltvs greater than 
while we believe these changes will improve our overall risk profile  in the near term  we will likely continue to be negatively affected by the performance of our existing insured loans with high ltvs 
pool mortgage insurance 
we offer pool mortgage insurance  which exposes us to different risks than the risks applicable to primary mortgage insurance 
our pool mortgage insurance products generally cover all losses in a pool of loans up to our aggregate exposure limit  which generally is between and of the initial aggregate loan balance of the entire pool of loans 
under pool insurance  we could be required to pay the full amount of every loan in the pool within our exposure limits and upon which a claim is made until the aggregate limit is reached  rather than a percentage of the loan amount  as is the case with traditional primary mortgage insurance 
at december   billion of our mortgage insurance risk in force was attributable to pool insurance  compared to billion at each of december  and december  
table of contents nims 
we have provided credit enhancement on nims 
nims are a relatively unproven product with a volatile performance history  particularly in the current declining housing market 
nims have been particularly susceptible to the disruption in the mortgage credit markets  and we stopped writing insurance on nims in we expect future principal credit losses on nims to be approximately million  with most payments expected to occur in and because our future expected credit losses are greater than our cumulative unrealized loss related to nims  we expect an additional negative impact to our results of operations related to nims in future periods 
a portion of our mortgage insurance risk in force consists of insurance on adjustable rate products such as arms that have resulted in significant losses and are expected to result in further losses 
at december   approximately of our mortgage insurance risk in force consists of arms of our mortgage insurance risk in force relates to arms with resets of less than five years from origination  which includes loans with negative amortization features  such as pay option arms 
we consider a loan an arm if the interest rate for that loan will reset at any point during the life of the loan 
it has been our experience that arms with resets of less than five years from origination are more likely to result in a claim than longer term arms 
our claim frequency on arms has been higher than on fixed rate loans due to monthly payment increases that occur when interest rates rise or when the teaser rate an initial interest rate that does not fully reflect the index which determines subsequent rates expires 
at december   approximately of our primary mortgage insurance risk in force consists of interest only mortgages  where the borrower pays only the interest on a mortgage for a specified period of time  usually five to ten years  after which the loan payment increases to include principal payments 
similar to arms  these loans have a heightened propensity to default because of possible payment shocks after the initial low payment period expires and because the borrower does not automatically build equity as payments are made 
a lack of liquidity in the mortgage market  tighter underwriting standards  and declining home prices in many regions in the us during and throughout  have combined to make it more difficult for many borrowers with arms and interest only mortgages to refinance their mortgages into lower fixed rate products 
as a result  without available alternatives  many borrowers have been forced into default when their interest rates reset 
this has resulted in significant losses during and for mortgage lenders and insurers as well as investors in the secondary market 
approximately of our total increase in mortgage insurance loss reserves during was attributable to adjustable rate products  which represented approximately of our mortgage insurance risk in force at december  although there can be no assurance  the historically low level of interest rates in the current mortgage market should help to reduce the size of interest payment increases and in some cases eliminate any increase for loans resetting in in the long term  however  absent a change in the current lending environment or a positive mitigating effect from recent legislation aimed at reducing defaults from adjustable rate resets see business regulation federal regulation indirect regulation above  we expect that defaults related to these products will likely continue to increase 
as of december   approximately and of the adjustable rate mortgages we insure are scheduled to reset during and  respectively 
if defaults related to adjustable rate mortgages were to continue at their current pace or were to increase as is currently projected  our results of operations will continue to be negatively affected  possibly significantly  which could adversely affect our financial and capital position 
recent losses in our mortgage insurance business have reduced radian guaranty s statutory surplus and increased radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio  additional losses in our mortgage insurance portfolio without a corresponding increase in new capital or capital relief could further negatively impact these ratios  which could limit radian guaranty s ability to write new insurance and could increase restrictions and requirements placed on radian guaranty by the gses or state insurance regulators 
the gses  rating agencies and state insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our subsidiaries 
these capital requirements include risk to capital ratios  leverage ratios and surplus requirements that limit the amount of insurance that our subsidiaries may write 
many states limit a mortgage insurer s 
table of contents risk to capital ratio to as a result of net losses during and  radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio grew from at december  to at december   even after including the contribution of our financial guaranty business to our mortgage insurance business during the third quarter of this contribution added approximately million in statutory capital to our mortgage insurance business 
based on current and expected future trends  we believe that we will continue to incur and pay material losses in our mortgage insurance business 
the ultimate amount of losses will depend in part on general economic conditions and other factors  including the health of credit markets  home price fluctuations and unemployment rates  all of which are difficult to predict 
in the absence of additional new capital or capital relief through reinsurance or otherwise  radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio is expected to continue to increase during as a result  we are actively exploring alternatives for raising additional capital  including raising capital through the issuance of equity in a private or public offering  or by selling our interest in sherman 
any future equity offerings could be significantly dilutive to our existing stockholders or could result in the issuance of securities that have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock 
we may also consider reinsuring our existing or future books of mortgage insurance business or reducing our volume of new insurance business to effectively reduce our risk in force 
we cannot provide any assurance as to whether we will be successful in obtaining additional capital or capital relief  especially given the limited opportunities for raising capital in the current marketplace 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining new capital or capital relief for radian guaranty  radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio could increase to the point where state insurance regulators may limit the amount of new insurance business that radian guaranty may write or prohibit radian guaranty from writing new insurance altogether 
in addition  the gses and our other customers may decide not to conduct new business with radian guaranty or reduce current business levels while its risk to capital ratio remained at elevated levels 
this ultimately could result in a loss of radian guaranty s eligibility with the gses 
the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business would be significantly diminished if radian guaranty was prohibited from writing new business or restricted in the amount of new business it could write 
any restriction on radian guaranty s ability to continue to write new insurance would likely harm our ability to attract new capital 
we and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive  detailed regulation  principally designed for the protection of our insured policyholders  rather than for the benefit of investors  by the insurance departments in the various states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business 
insurance laws vary from state to state  but generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business  including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company s ability to write new business 
given the recent significant losses incurred by many insurers in the mortgage and financial guaranty industries  our insurance subsidiaries have been subject to heightened scrutiny by insurance regulators 
we are currently in close communication with certain insurance regulatory authorities  including the pennsylvania insurance department with respect to radian guaranty and radian insurance  the illinois division of insurance regarding amerin guaranty and the texas department of insurance regarding commonwealth mortgage assurance company of texas  which reinsures a portion of radian guaranty s portfolio 
amerin guaranty  which insured second lien mortgages and therefore is currently in run off  currently is prohibited from writing new insurance business in four states 
additionally  the hong kong insurance authority has directed radian insurance to continue to maintain sufficient assets in hong kong to cover its potential liabilities on insured loans in hong kong 
in light of current market conditions and on going deterioration in our financial condition  insurance departments in the jurisdictions noted above or in other jurisdictions could impose restrictions or requirements that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses 

table of contents the long term capital adequacy of radian guaranty is dependent  in part  upon the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio 
during the third quarter of  we implemented an internally sourced capital plan by contributing our financial guaranty business to our mortgage insurance business 
this reorganization provided radian guaranty with immediate and substantial regulatory capital credit 
importantly  it also is intended to provide radian guaranty with significant cash infusions from dividends over time 
the timing and amount of these cash infusions will depend on the dividend capacity of our financial guaranty business  which is governed by new york insurance laws 
as of december   radian asset assurance  our principal financial guaranty subsidiary  maintained a statutory surplus of approximately million and claims paying resources of approximately billion 
assuming the credit performance of our financial guaranty business remains stable  we expect our financial guaranty business to issue significant dividends to radian guaranty over time as our existing financial guaranty portfolio matures and the exposure is reduced 
if the exposure is reduced on an accelerated basis through the recapture of insured business from our primary financial guaranty reinsurance customers or otherwise  we may have the ability to release capital to radian guaranty more quickly and in a greater amount 
if  however  the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio deteriorated materially  our financial guaranty statutory surplus could be reduced  which in turn would have a negative impact on the regulatory capital of radian guaranty 
further  our financial guaranty business would likely have less capacity to issue dividends to radian guaranty  and could be restricted from issuing dividends altogether  if our financial guaranty portfolio deteriorates materially 
any perceived or actual decrease in the capital support derived from our financial guaranty business could negatively impact the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business 
see we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise below 
our financial guaranty portfolio is exposed to risks associated with the on going deterioration in the credit markets and the overall economy 
see we have experienced deterioration on our financial guaranty portfolio  some of our financial guaranty products may be riskier than traditional guaranties of public finance obligations and our financial guaranty business faces risks associated with our reinsurance of risk from our financial guaranty insurance customers and our second to pay liabilities from these entities below 
we have experienced deterioration in our financial guaranty portfolio 
our financial guaranty portfolio is exposed to risks associated with the deterioration in the credit markets and the overall economy 
as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of business results financial guaranty credit performance  in item of part ii below  we experienced deterioration in our financial guaranty portfolio during  primarily related to deterioration in the consumer finance markets and in public finance 
the performance of our reinsurance portfolio of assumed rmbs and abs credits deteriorated during as of december   million of our exposure to rmbs outside of cdos that we insure was assumed from our primary reinsurance customers 
of this exposure  million was subprime and alt a rmbs 
while we did not experience material deterioration in our directly insured portfolio  there was ratings deterioration within our corporate cdo portfolio due to the impact of several credit events in the second half of while we have sought to underwrite our insured credits with levels of subordination designed to protect us from loss in the event of poor performance of the underlying collateral  we cannot be certain that such levels of subordination will protect us from future material losses in light of the significantly higher rates of delinquency  foreclosure and losses currently being observed within our insured credits 

table of contents some of our financial guaranty products may be riskier than traditional guarantees of public finance obligations historically  our financial guaranty public finance business has focused on smaller  regionalized  lower investment grade issuers and structures that were uneconomical for most of the larger  higher rated financial guarantors to insure 
as a result  we have greater exposure than other monoline financial guarantors to sectors such as healthcare and long term care and education that historically have had higher default rates than other public finance sectors 
these risks  which generally cover smaller  more rural and specialized issuers  tend to be lower rated and more susceptible to default in an economic downturn such as the one we currently are facing 
in addition to our public finance business  we have guaranteed structured finance obligations that expose us to a variety of complex credit risks and indirectly to market  political and other risks beyond those that generally apply to financial guaranties of public finance obligations 
we have insured and reinsured certain asset backed transactions and securitizations secured by one or a few classes of assets  such as residential mortgages  auto loans and leases  credit card receivables and other consumer assets  both funded and synthetic  and obligations under credit default swaps  including cdos of several asset classes  including  corporate debt  trups  rmbs  cmbs and other abs obligations 
we continue to have exposure to trade credit reinsurance which is currently in run off  which protects sellers of goods under certain circumstances against nonpayment of their accounts receivable 
these guaranties expose us to the risk of buyer nonpayment  which could be triggered by many factors  including the failure of a buyer s business 
these guaranties may cover receivables where the buyer and seller are in the same country as well as cross border receivables 
in the case of cross border transactions  in certain cases  we provide coverage that effectively covers losses that could result from political risks  such as foreign currency controls and expropriation  which could interfere with the payment from the buyer 
losses associated with our structured finance and trade credit reinsurance businesses are difficult to predict accurately and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results  especially given the current economic disruption 
our financial guaranty business faces risks associated with our reinsurance of risk from our financial guaranty insurance customers and our second to pay liabilities from these entities 
in june  s p downgraded our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries financial strength ratings 
as a result  all but one of our primary reinsurance customers now has the right to take back or recapture up to an aggregate of billion of business previously ceded to us under their reinsurance agreements with us 
approximately two thirds of this business is subject to recapture by one primary insurance customer 
under our treaties with our primary reinsurance customers  our customers do not have the ability to selectively recapture business previously ceded to us under their treaties 
however  because we have entered into multiple treaties with each customer  it is possible that our customers may choose to recapture business only under those treaties that they perceive as covering less risky portions of our reinsurance portfolio 
our reinsurance customers are primarily responsible for surveillance  loss mitigation and salvage on the risks that they cede to us 
many of these customers are experiencing financial difficulties  and therefore  may be less willing to or capable of performing surveillance to the extent necessary to minimize potential losses and or maximize potential salvage on the credits we reinsure 
we generally do not have direct access to the insured obligation or the right to perform our own loss mitigation or salvage work on these transactions 
we also have limited visibility with respect to the performance of many of the obligations we reinsure 
see if the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves for our mortgage insurance or financial guaranty businesses are incorrect  we may be required to take unexpected charges to income and our ratings may be downgraded below 
in addition  our primary reinsurance customers may delegate their loss adjustment functions to third parties  the cost of which would then be proportionally allocated to us and any other reinsurers for the insured transaction 
accordingly  the losses and loss adjustment expenses allocated to us on our reinsured risks may be significantly higher than otherwise would have been the case if we were responsible for surveillance  loss mitigation and salvage for these risks 
this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

table of contents we have directly insured several transactions on a second to pay basis  meaning that we are obligated to pay claims in these transactions only to the extent that another monoline financial guarantor fails to pay such claim 
consequently  if a financial guarantor should become insolvent or the conservator for such financial guarantor rejects payment of all or a portion of a claim  we may be required to pay all or a portion of such claim 
because many monoline financial guarantors are currently experiencing significant financial difficulties  the likelihood of our having to pay a claim on our second to pay transactions has increased 
because most of the mortgage loans that we insure are sold to freddie mac and fannie mae  changes in their charters or business practices could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business 
freddie mac and fannie mae are the beneficiaries of the majority of our mortgage insurance policies 
freddie mac s and fannie mae s federal charters generally prohibit them from purchasing any mortgage with a loan amount that exceeds of a home s value  unless that mortgage is insured by a qualified insurer or the mortgage seller retains at least a participation in the loan or agrees to repurchase the loan in the event of a default 
as a result  high ltv mortgages purchased by freddie mac or fannie mae generally are insured with private mortgage insurance 
changes in the charters or business practices of freddie mac or fannie mae could reduce the number of mortgages they purchase that are insured by us and consequently diminish our franchise value 
some of freddie mac s and fannie mae s more recent programs require less insurance coverage than they historically have required  and they have the ability to further reduce coverage requirements  which could reduce demand for mortgage insurance and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
they also have the ability to implement new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers and to alter or liberalize underwriting standards on low down payment mortgages they purchase 
see we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise below  alter the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law  require private mortgage insurers to perform activities intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages that are in default  and influence a mortgage lender s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage 
the gses business practices may be impacted by their results of operations as well as legislative or regulatory changes governing their operations 
in july  an overhaul of regulatory oversight of the gses was enacted 
the new provisions  contained within the housing and economic recovery act  encompass substantially all of the gses operations 
this new law abolished the former regulator for the gses and created a new  stronger regulator  the fhfa  in addition to other oversight reforms 
in september  the fhfa was appointed as the conservator of the gses 
as their conservator  the fhfa controls and directs the operations of the gses 
the appointment of a conservator may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the gses will be changed in ways that may have a material adverse effect on us 
in particular  if the private mortgage insurance industry does not have the ability  due to capital constraints  to continue to write sufficient business to meet the needs of the gses  the gses may seek alternatives other than private mortgage insurance to conduct their business 
the appointment of a conservator also increases the likelihood that the us congress will examine the role and purpose of the gses in the domestic housing market and potentially make certain structural and other changes to the gses 
although we believe that private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future structure involving the gses  there is a possibility that new federal legislation could reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the gses as credit enhancement or eliminate the requirement altogether 
in connection with the recently announced homeownership affordability and stability plan  the fhfa will allow the gses to refinance their own qualifying loans without mortgage insurance if the original loan does not have mortgage insurance 

table of contents we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise 
in order to maintain the highest level of eligibility with freddie mac and fannie mae  mortgage insurers generally must maintain an insurer financial strength rating of aa or aa from at least two of the three ratings agencies by which they are customarily rated 
if a mortgage insurer were to lose such eligibility  freddie mac and or fannie mae could restrict the mortgage insurer from conducting certain types of business with them  or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by the mortgage insurer 
in light of the housing market downturn  both freddie mac and fannie mae have indicated that loss of mortgage insurer eligibility due to such a downgrade will no longer be automatic and will be subject to review if and when the downgrade occurs 
our mortgage insurance subsidiaries have been downgraded substantially below aa aa by s p and moody s 
in response to these ratings actions  we have presented business and financial plans to freddie mac and fannie mae for how to restore profitability and ultimately regain a higher rating for our mortgage insurance business 
these plans recently have focused on our completed internal reorganization in which we contributed our financial guaranty business to our mortgage insurance business  thus providing our mortgage insurance business with substantial regulatory capital credit and potential cash infusions over time 
see the long term capital adequacy of radian guaranty is dependent  in part  upon the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio above for risks associated with this plan 
the amount of capital credit that we may receive as a result of the internal reorganization is uncertain and depends on the rating agencies and gse s views of the credit quality of our financial guaranty portfolio and our expected dividend capacity from financial guaranty  among other factors 
our ratings are also driven by the rating agencies views of the mortgage insurance industry as a whole 
if the capital credit we receive from the rating agencies and gses is less than they believe may be required by our mortgage insurance business  we could lose our eligibility with the gses and or be further downgraded by the rating agencies 
our remediation plans include projections of our future financial performance  including the effect of significant changes to the underwriting and pricing of our business 
although their initial reactions to our plans were favorable  we cannot be certain that either of the gses will accept our plans or if we will be able to retain our eligibility status with either of them 
loss of our eligibility status with the gses would likely have an immediate and material adverse impact on the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and our future prospects and could negatively impact our long term result of operations and financial condition 
deterioration in regional economic factors in areas where our business is concentrated increases our losses in these areas 
our results of operations and financial condition are particularly affected by weakening economic conditions  such as depreciating home values and unemployment  in specific regions including international markets where our business is concentrated 
approximately of our primary mortgage insurance in force is concentrated in states  with the highest percentages being in california  florida and texas 
a large percentage of our second lien mortgage insurance in force also is concentrated in california and florida 
throughout  deteriorating markets in california and florida  where non prime and non traditional mortgage products such as arms including interest only loans are prevalent and where home prices have fallen significantly  have resulted in significant losses in our mortgage insurance business 
approximately of our total increase in primary mortgage insurance loss reserves during was attributable to these states  which together represented approximately of our primary mortgage insurance risk in force at december  during the prolonged period of rising home prices that preceded the current downturn in the us housing market  very few mortgage delinquencies and claims were attributable to insured loans in california  despite the significant growth during this period of riskier  non traditional mortgage products in this state 
as mortgage credit performance in california and florida has deteriorated  given the size of these markets  our loss experience has been significantly affected and will continue to be negatively affected if conditions continue to deteriorate as we expect 

table of contents in addition to california and florida  approximately of our primary mortgage insurance risk in force at december  was concentrated in the midwestern states of michigan  illinois and ohio 
this region continued to experience higher default rates in  which are largely attributable to the difficult operating environment facing the domestic auto industry 
we expect that this trend may continue and could become worse 
our financial guaranty business also has a significant portion of its insurance in force concentrated in a small number of states  principally including california  texas  new york  pennsylvania  and florida  and could be affected by a weakening of economic conditions in these states 
in addition to the impact of regional housing and credit market deterioration  our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by natural disasters or other catastrophic events  acts of terrorism  conflicts  event specific economic depressions or other harmful events in the regions  including areas internationally  where our business is concentrated 
a decrease in the volume of home mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new insurance business 
our ability to write new business depends on a steady flow of high ltv mortgages that require our mortgage insurance 
the deterioration in the credit performance of non prime and other forms of non conforming loans during and has caused lenders to substantially reduce the availability of non prime mortgages and most other loan products that are not conforming loans  and to significantly tighten their underwriting standards 
fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications  while improving the overall quality of new mortgage originations  have in turn reduced the pool of qualified homebuyers and made it more difficult for buyers in particular first time buyers to obtain mortgage financing or to refinance their existing mortgages 
in addition  the significant disruption in the housing and related credit markets has led to reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the secondary market  which historically has been an available source of funding for many mortgage lenders 
this has significantly reduced liquidity in the mortgage funding marketplace  forcing many lenders to retain a larger portion of their mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities and leaving them with less capacity to continue to originate new mortgages 
the potential negative effect on our business from the decreased volume of mortgage originations has been offset by an increase in the demand for mortgage insurance on conforming loans as the lending industry embraces more prudent risk management measures 
however  if the volume of new mortgage originations continues to decrease or persists at low levels for a prolonged period of time  we may experience fewer opportunities to write new insurance business  which could reduce our existing insurance in force and have a significant negative effect on both our ability to execute our business plans and our overall franchise value 
because our mortgage insurance business is concentrated among a few significant customers  our new business written and franchise value could decline if we lose any significant customer 
our mortgage insurance business depends to a significant degree on a small number of lending customers 
our top ten mortgage insurance customers are generally responsible for half of both our primary new insurance written in a given year and our direct primary risk in force 
accordingly  maintaining our business relationships and business volumes with our largest lending customers is important to the success of our business 
challenging market conditions during and have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the financial condition of a number of our largest lending customers 
many of these customers have experienced ratings downgrades and liquidity constraints in the face of increasing delinquencies and the lack of a secondary market for mortgage funding 
these customers could become subject to serious liquidity constraints that may jeopardize the viability of their business plans or their access to additional capital  forcing them to consider alternatives such as bankruptcy or consolidation with others in the industry 
in addition  as a result of current market conditions  our largest lending customers may seek to diversify their exposure to any one or more mortgage insurers or decide to write business only with those mortgage insurers that they perceive to have the 
table of contents strongest financial position 
during and throughout  we have tightened our underwriting guidelines  which has resulted in our declining to insure some of the loans originated by our larger customers 
we ve also increased our pricing to reflect the increased risk of default in the current economic and housing downturn 
the loss of business from even one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write  and consequently  our franchise value 
our master policies and related lender agreements do not  and by law cannot  require our mortgage insurance customers to do business with us  and we cannot be certain that any loss of business from a single lender will be recouped from other lending customers in the industry 
our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition 
the us mortgage insurance industry is highly dynamic and intensely competitive 
our competitors include other private mortgage insurers and federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies  principally the va and the fha  which has significantly increased its competitive position in areas with higher home prices by streamlining its down payment formula and reducing the premiums it charges 
governmental and quasi governmental entities typically do not have the same capital requirements that we and other mortgage insurance companies have  and therefore  have greater financial flexibility in their pricing and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
in the event that a government owned or sponsored entity in one of our markets decides to reduce prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit motive  we may be unable to compete in that market effectively  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we believe the fha has substantially increased its market share in  including by insuring a number of loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines at a cost to the borrower that is lower than the cost of our insurance 
for information regarding certain legislative developments that have enhanced the fha s competitive position  see legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our mortgage insurance business below 
in light of the capital constraints currently facing most  if not all  private mortgage insurers and the need by private mortgage insurers to tighten underwriting guidelines based on past loan performance  we anticipate that the fha will continue to maintain a strong market position and could increase its market position to the point that private mortgage insurers may be perceived as less significant to the future of the housing finance market 
while the mortgage insurance industry has not had new entrants in many years  it is possible that the improvement in the credit quality of new loans being insured in the current market combined with the deterioration of the financial strength ratings of the existing mortgage insurance companies  in part due to their legacy books of insured mortgages  could encourage new entrants 
our inability to compete with other providers  including any new entrants  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  in the recent past  an increasing number of alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance developed  many of which reduced the demand for our mortgage insurance 
these alternatives included mortgage lenders structuring mortgage originations to avoid private mortgage insurance  mostly through loans or other forms of simultaneous second loans 
the use of simultaneous second loans increased significantly during the recent past to become a competitive alternative to private mortgage insurance  particularly in light of the potential lower monthly cost of simultaneous second loans compared to the cost of mortgage insurance in a low interest rate environment and possible negative borrower  broker and realtor perceptions about mortgage insurance  investors using other forms of credit enhancement such as credit default swaps or securitizations as a partial or complete substitute for private mortgage insurance  and 
table of contents mortgage lenders and other intermediaries foregoing third party insurance coverage and retaining the full risk of loss on their high ltv loans 
as a result of the on going turmoil in the housing credit market  many of these alternatives to private mortgage insurance are no longer available in the mortgage market  although simultaneous second loans are still available and their use may grow again 
if market conditions were to change  however  we again could likely face significant competition from these alternatives as well as others that may develop 
our business depends  in part  on effective and reliable loan servicing  which may be negatively impacted by the current disruption in the housing and mortgage credit markets 
we depend on reliable  consistent third party servicing of the loans that we insure 
dependable servicing generally ensures timely billing and strong loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near delinquent loans 
many of our customers also serve as the servicers for loans that we insure  whether the loans were originated by such customer or another lender 
therefore  the same market conditions affecting our customers as discussed above in because our mortgage insurance business is concentrated among a few significant customers  our new business written and franchise value could decline if we lose any significant customer also will affect their ability to effectively maintain their servicing operations 
in addition  current housing trends have led to a significant increase in the number of delinquent mortgage loans requiring servicing 
these increases have strained the resources of servicers  reducing their ability to undertake loss mitigation efforts that could help limit our losses 
managing a substantially higher volume of non performing loans could create operational difficulties that our servicers may not have the resources to overcome 
if a disruption occurs in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies  this  in turn  could contribute to a rise in delinquencies and or claims among those loans and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
loan modification and other similar programs may not provide us with a material benefit 
recently  the fdic  as receiver of indymac  the gses and lenders have adopted programs to modify loans to make them more affordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures 
in february  the us treasury announced the homeowner affordability and stability plan  which provides certain guidelines for loan modifications and allocates billion for this purpose 
all of the programs adopted to date are in their early stages and it is unclear whether they will result in a significant number of loan modifications 
even if a loan is modified  we do not know how many modified loans will subsequently re default 
as a result  we cannot ascertain with confidence whether these programs will provide material benefits to us 
in addition  because we do not have information for all of the parameters used to determine which of our insured loans are eligible for modification programs  our estimates of the number of qualifying loans are inherently uncertain 
the us treasury is supporting judicial modifications for home mortgages during bankruptcy proceedings 
if legislation is enacted to permit a mortgage balance to be reduced in bankruptcy  we would still be responsible under our master insurance policy to pay the original balance if the borrower re defaulted on that mortgage after its balance has been reduced 
various government entities have enacted foreclosure moratoriums 
a moratorium does not affect the accrual of interest and other expenses on a loan 
unless a loan is modified during a moratorium to cure the default  at the expiration of the moratorium  additional interest and expenses would be due  which could result in our losses on loans subject to the moratorium being higher than if there had been no moratorium 
mortgage refinancings in the current housing market may increase the risk profile of our existing mortgage insurance portfolio 
mortgage interest rates currently are at historically low levels  which has led many borrowers to seek to refinance their existing mortgages 
however  because most lenders are currently utilizing more restrictive underwriting guidelines  only those borrowers with strong credit profiles are generally able to qualify for the new 
table of contents loans required to refinance 
consequently  only high quality borrowers are generally able to refinance in the current market 
as more of these borrowers refinance and their existing mortgage insurance with us is canceled  the total percentage of our risk in force related to high risk borrowers could possibly increase  which could increase the risk profile of our existing mortgage insurance portfolio and potentially reduce the future profitability of our mortgage insurance business 
our success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks 
our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty premium rates may not be adequate to cover future losses 
our mortgage insurance premiums are based on our long term expected risk of claims on insured loans  and take into account  among other factors  each loan s ltv  type eg  prime vs 
non prime or fixed vs 
variable payments  term  coverage percentage or the existence of a deductible in front of our loss position 
our financial guaranty premiums are based on our expected risk of claim on the insured obligation  and take into account  among other factors  the rating and creditworthiness of the issuer and of the insured obligations  the type of insured obligation  the policy term and the structure of the transaction being insured 
in addition  our premium rates take into account expected cancellation rates  operating expenses and reinsurance costs  as well as profit and capital needs and the prices that we expect our competitors to offer 
we generally cannot cancel or elect not to renew the mortgage insurance or financial guaranty insurance coverage we provide  and because we generally fix premium rates for the life of a policy when issued  we cannot adjust renewal premiums or otherwise adjust premiums over the life of a policy 
therefore  even if the risk underlying many of the mortgage or financial guaranty products we have insured develops more adversely than we anticipated  including as a result of the on going economic recession and housing market downturn  and the premiums our customers are currently paying for similar coverage from us and others has increased  we generally cannot increase the premium rates on this in force business  or cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage  to mitigate the effects of such adverse developments 
our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur 
an increase in the amount or frequency of claims beyond the levels contemplated by our pricing assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims 
in our mortgage insurance business  we enter into agreements with our mortgage lender customers that commit us to insure loans using pre established underwriting guidelines 
once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program  we generally insure a loan originated by that lender even if the lender does not follow our specified underwriting guidelines 
under this program  a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and terminate that lender s delegated underwriting authority 
even if we terminate a lender s underwriting authority  we remain at risk for any loans by that lender that we previously insured before termination 
the performance of loans insured through programs of delegated underwriting has not been tested over a period of extended adverse economic conditions  and the program could lead to greater losses than we anticipate in light of the current economic downturn 
greater than anticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we face risks associated with our contract underwriting business 
we provide contract underwriting services for certain of our mortgage lender customers  including on loans for which we are not providing mortgage insurance 
under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements  we agree that if we make material errors that lead to a default in connection with these services  the mortgage lender may  subject to certain conditions  require us to purchase the loans  issue mortgage insurance on the loans  or indemnify the lender against future loss associated with the loans 
accordingly  we assume some credit risk and interest rate risk in connection with providing these services 
in  we underwrote billion in principal 
table of contents amount of loans through contract underwriting 
depending on market conditions  a significant amount of our underwriting services may be performed by independent contractors hired by us on a temporary basis 
if these independent contractors make more material errors than we anticipate  the resulting need to provide greater than anticipated recourse to mortgage lenders could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our loss mitigation opportunities are reduced in markets where housing values fail to appreciate or begin to decline 
the amount of mortgage insurance loss we suffer depends in part on whether the home of a borrower who has defaulted on a mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover unpaid principal and interest on the mortgage and expenses from the sale 
if a borrower defaults under our standard mortgage insurance policy  we generally have the option of paying the entire loss amount and taking title to a mortgaged property or paying our coverage percentage in full satisfaction of our obligations under the policy 
in the past  we have been able to take title to the properties underlying certain defaulted loans and sell the properties quickly at prices that have allowed us to recover some or all of our losses 
in the current housing market downturn  our ability to mitigate our losses in such manner has been reduced 
if housing values continue to decline  or decline more significantly and or on a larger geographic basis than is currently anticipated  the frequency of loans going to claim could increase and our ability to mitigate our losses on defaulted mortgages may be significantly reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings or the insurance financial strength ratings assigned to any of our mortgage insurance or financial guaranty subsidiaries is possible and could weaken our competitive position and affect our financial condition 
the credit ratings of radian group and the insurance financial strength ratings assigned to our subsidiaries were downgraded multiple times during and again in and may be further downgraded 
in response to current market conditions  the rating agencies are engaged in ongoing monitoring of the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty industries and could take action  including by downgrading or warning of the strong possibility of downgrade  with respect to one or more companies in a specific industry 
although we remain in frequent contact with the rating agencies and have prepared action plans to address rating agency actions  we are generally not provided with much advance notice of an impending rating decision  which could come at any time 
historically  our ratings have been critical to our ability to market our products and to maintain our competitive position and customer confidence in our products 
a downgrade in these ratings or the announcement of the potential of a downgrade  or any other concern relating to the on going financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries  could i make it difficult or impossible for them to continue to write new profitable business  ii create a competitive advantage for other industry participants that maintain higher ratings than us  or iii give existing customers or counterparties the right to recapture business previously written by us 
further  although we believe the gses currently are not as concerned with ratings as they have been in past periods  any additional downgrade of the insurance financial strength ratings for our mortgage insurance business could negatively impact our eligibility status with the gses 
we may be required to raise additional capital in the event of a downgrade or the likelihood of a downgrade  which we may not be able to do on terms acceptable to us or in an amount that would be sufficient to restore or stabilize our ratings 
additional capital could dilute our existing stockholders and reduce our per share earnings 
if the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves for our mortgage insurance or financial guaranty businesses are incorrect  we may be required to take unexpected charges to income and our ratings may be downgraded 
we establish loss reserves in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses to provide for the estimated cost of future claims 
because our reserves represent our best estimate of claims  these reserves 
table of contents may be insufficient to satisfy the full amount of claims that we ultimately have to pay 
setting our loss reserves requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of anticipated losses 
the models and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may prove to be inaccurate  especially during an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme credit market volatility  as currently exists 
if our estimates are inadequate  we may be required to increase our reserves  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  capital position and operating results  as well as our ability to continue to write new business 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we generally do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two consecutive payments when due 
upon notification that two payments have been missed  we establish a loss reserve by using historical models based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the type of loan  the status of the loan as reported by the servicer of the loan  and the area where the loan is located 
because our mortgage insurance reserving does not account for future losses that we expect to incur with respect to in force loans that have not defaulted  our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to incur at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements  except to the extent that a premium deficiency exists 
we also are required under gaap to establish a premium deficiency reserve for our mortgage insurance products if the amount by which the net present value of expected future losses for a particular product and the expenses for such product exceeds the expected future premiums and existing reserves for such product 
we evaluate whether a premium deficiency exists at the end of each fiscal quarter 
during the second quarter of  we established a premium deficiency reserve of million for our first lien mortgage insurance business  which was reduced to as of december  a premium deficiency reserve of million existed for our second lien mortgage insurance business as of december  because our evaluation of premium deficiency is based on our best estimate of future losses  expenses and premiums  the evaluation is inherently uncertain and may prove to be inaccurate 
although no premium deficiency existed on our first lien mortgage insurance business at december   there can be no assurance that additional premium deficiency reserves will not be required for this product or our other mortgage insurance products in future periods 
it also is difficult to estimate appropriate loss reserves for our financial guaranty business because of the nature of potential losses in that business  which are largely influenced by the particular circumstances surrounding each troubled credit  including the availability of loss mitigation  and therefore  are less capable of being evaluated based on historical assumptions or precedent 
in addition  in our reinsurance business  we rely in part on information provided by the primary insurer in order to establish reserves 
if this information is incomplete or untimely  our loss reserves may be inaccurate and could require adjustment in future periods as new or corrected information becomes available 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio 
income from our investment portfolio is one of our primary sources of cash flow to support our operations and claim payments 
if we underestimate our policy liabilities  or if we improperly structure our investments to meet those liabilities  we could have unexpected losses  including losses resulting from forced liquidation of investments before their maturity 
our investments and investment policies and those of our subsidiaries are subject to state insurance laws 
we may be forced to change our investments or investment policies depending upon regulatory  economic and market conditions and the existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements  including the tax position  of our business segments 
our investment objectives may not be achieved 
although our portfolio consists mostly of highly rated investments and complies with applicable regulatory requirements  the success of our investment activity is affected by general economic conditions  which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest rate sensitive securities  including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets  the level and 
table of contents volatility of interest rates and  consequently  the value of our fixed income securities 
during the second half of  we experienced modest negative returns in our investment portfolio as a result of the on going deterioration in the economy 
continued volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which we directly or indirectly hold positions has reduced the market value of many of our investments and has caused other than temporary impairments within our portfolio  which  if this continues  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and operating results 
as a holding company  radian group relies on its operating subsidiaries to fund its dividend payments and to meet its obligations 
radian group acts principally as a holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own 
radian group s principal liquidity demands over the next months include funds for i the payment of dividends on our common stock  ii the payment of certain corporate expenses which are fully reimbursed through expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  iii interest payments on our outstanding long term debt and borrowings under our credit facility which are fully reimbursed through expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  iv payments to our insurance subsidiaries under our tax sharing agreement  and v potential capital support for our insurance subsidiaries 
radian group held directly or through an unregulated direct subsidiary  unrestricted cash and marketable securities of million at december  dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and sherman  and permitted payments to radian group under tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries are radian group s principal sources of cash 
our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to radian group is subject to various conditions imposed by the gses and rating agencies  and by insurance regulations requiring insurance department approval 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
in light of on going losses in our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  we do not anticipate that these subsidiaries will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to issue dividends to radian group for the foreseeable future 
to the extent radian asset assurance is permitted to issue dividends  these dividends will be issued to radian guaranty  the direct parent company of radian asset assurance  and not to radian group 
dividends from sherman are not subject to regulatory conditions  but to the extent received  must be used to pay down outstanding amounts under our credit facility if such amounts exceed our tax obligations resulting from our equity ownership of sherman 
the expense sharing arrangements between radian group and our insurance subsidiaries  as amended  have been approved by applicable state insurance departments  but such approval may be changed at any time 
further  any changes to these expense sharing arrangements must be approved by the administrative agent to our credit facility 
if the cash radian group receives from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment and expense and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for radian group to fund its obligations  we may be required to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt  by issuing additional equity or by selling assets  which we may be unable to do on favorable terms  if at all 
the need to raise additional capital or the failure to make timely payments on our obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we have significant payment obligations upcoming in and under our current tax sharing agreement between radian group and our subsidiaries  our subsidiaries are required to pay to radian group on a quarterly basis  amounts representing their estimated separate company tax liability for the current tax year 
radian group is required to refund to each subsidiary any amount that such subsidiary overpaid to radian group for a taxable year as well as any amount that the subsidiary could utilize through existing carry back provisions of the code had such subsidiary filed its federal tax return on a separate company basis 
we currently believe that radian group will be required to pay approximately million to our subsidiaries by october  including approximately million to radian guaranty 
in addition  based on our current tax loss projections  we believe that radian group will be required to pay an additional amount of approximately million to radian guaranty in october  which amount could increase up to a maximum of million if actual tax losses are worse than projected 
all amounts required to be paid under our tax 
table of contents sharing agreement are dependent on the extent of tax losses in current and future periods 
a portion of these payments may be funded from refunds that radian group receives from the internal revenue service irs 
we currently anticipate receiving approximately million refund from the irs in or relating to the carry back of our net operating loss 
our tax sharing agreement may not be changed without the pre approval of the applicable state insurance departments for certain of the insurance subsidiaries that are party to the agreement 
our million credit facility expires in february  at which time we will be required to repay all million in outstanding principal as well as any interest then outstanding 
in addition  we have million in principal amount of debentures that are due in june as well as million in principal amount of senior notes due in each of and in light of the on going turmoil in the housing and related credit markets  we do not expect to be profitable in  and radian group does not expect to receive any dividends from our insurance subsidiaries in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  in order to satisfy our payment obligations in and  we likely will be required to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt or issuing additional equity  which could be significantly dilutive to our stockholders  or by selling assets  including our interest in sherman  which we may not be able to do on favorable terms  if at all 
the current turmoil in the mortgage market has created a situation where it would be difficult to raise capital or refinance our long term debt on favorable terms if it were due currently 
we expect that market conditions will improve by  but cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to access the capital markets on favorable terms  if at all 
our credit facility was amended in  reducing our liquidity and adding additional restrictions on our ability to operate our business 
our failure to comply with  cure breaches of  or obtain waivers for  covenants could result in an acceleration of the due dates of our credit facility and our publicly traded debt 
we currently have million in principal amount outstanding under our credit facility  which matures in february we have no unused commitment that we may draw on 
in addition  we have million in debentures due in june  million in senior notes due in february and million in senior notes due in the credit agreement governing our credit facility restricts  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  enter into mergers  consolidations and sales of certain of our assets  make certain investments or other specified restricted payments  including investments in  loans to  or guarantying any obligations of  radian asset assurance other than with respect to its soft capital program  pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our capital stock in excess of a permitted annual amount generally equal to our current dividend and subject to certain adjustments  and sell certain of our assets and  in certain circumstances  issue stock 
although our credit agreement no longer has a ratings trigger or debt to capital requirement  and we have eliminated some other requirements  we also agreed to some new restrictions in recent amendments of the credit agreement 
for example  we now are limited in the amount of dividends we may pay even if we are not in default under our credit facility 
under our credit facility as amended  in addition to our business covenants  we are required to maintain subject to certain adjustments  a consolidated net worth of at least billion through june   billion from july  through december  and billion at any time thereafter  in each case  subject to upward adjustment if we receive net proceeds from the issuance of certain securities 
our consolidated net worth under the credit facility is determined by excluding mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments and investments reflected on our financial statements 
at december   our consolidated net worth as determined under the facility was billion 
we expect to incur a net operating loss in  which would negatively impact our consolidated net worth 
in addition  our consolidated net worth would be further reduced if we realize losses in our investment portfolio 
although we do not expect to breach our net worth covenant based on our current loss projections  there can be no assurance that losses in or after will not reduce our consolidated net worth below the minimum amount required by our covenant  which would cause our default under the credit facility 

table of contents we would also be in default under our credit facility if  among other things any of our main insurance subsidiaries a fails to meet or maintain minimum levels of statutory capital or surplus  b is prohibited from writing  underwriting  assuming  or reinsuring further business  or c is otherwise prohibited by its regulators from writing or materially restricted from performing any of its core business activities  and in such event our shared expense reimbursement payments from our subsidiaries do not cover all of our operating expenses and debt service 
we discuss our mortgage insurance statutory surplus and risk to capital or leverage ratios above in recent losses in our mortgage insurance business have reduced radian guaranty s statutory surplus and increased radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio  additional losses in our mortgage insurance portfolio without a corresponding increase in new capital or capital relief could further negatively impact these ratios  which could limit radian guaranty s ability to write new insurance and could increase restrictions and requirements placed on radian guaranty by the gses or state insurance regulators 
any of our main insurance subsidiaries fails to pay any shared expense reimbursement payment to radian group under our expense sharing arrangements  or an insurance regulatory authority or other governmental authority voids  terminates  prohibits  suspends or otherwise causes to be invalid or ineffective  any of our expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries 
if we default under our credit agreement  the agent or the lenders representing a majority of the debt under our credit agreement would have the right to terminate all commitments under the credit agreement and declare the outstanding debt due and payable 
if the debt under our credit agreement were accelerated in this manner and not repaid  the holders of or more of our publicly traded million debentures due in june  the holders of or more of our publicly traded million senior notes due in february and the holders of or more of our publicly traded million senior notes due in  each would have the right to accelerate the maturity of those debts  respectively 
we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
however  if the amounts due under our credit agreement or any series of our outstanding long term debt are accelerated  we may not have sufficient funds in the future to repay any such amounts 
our reported earnings are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our credit derivatives that require us to adjust their fair market value as reflected on our income statement 
we provide credit enhancement in the form of derivative contracts 
the gains and losses on these derivative contracts are derived from internally generated models  which may differ from models used by our counterparties or others in the industry 
we estimate fair value amounts using market information  to the extent available  and valuation methodologies that we deem appropriate in order to estimate the fair value amounts that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability 
considerable judgment is required to interpret available market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
since there currently is no active market for many derivative products  we have had to use assumptions as to what could be realized in a current market exchange 
in the event that our investments or derivative contracts were sold or transferred in a forced liquidation  the fair values received or paid could be materially different than those reflected in our financial statements 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies derivative assets and liabilities in item below 
temporary market or credit spread changes as well as actual credit improvement or deterioration in our derivative contracts are reflected in changes in fair value of derivative instruments 
because the adjustments referenced above are reflected on our statements of income  they affect our reported earnings and create earnings volatility 
additionally  beginning in  in accordance with sfas no 
 we made an adjustment to our derivatives valuation methodology to account for our own non performance risk by incorporating our observable credit default swap spread into the determination of fair value of our credit derivatives 
our five year credit 
table of contents default swap spread has increased significantly  and was  basis points as of december  this market perception of our high risk of non performance has had the effect of reducing our derivative liability valuations by approximately billion as of december  if our credit default swap spread were to tighten significantly  and other credit spreads utilized in our fair value methodologies remained constant  our earnings could be significantly reduced 
the performance of our strategic investments could harm our financial results 
part of our business involves strategic investments in other companies  and we generally do not have control over the way that these companies run their day to day operations 
our equity interest in sherman currently represents our most significant strategic investment 
sherman is a consumer asset and servicing firm specializing in charged off and bankruptcy plan consumer assets that it generally purchases at deep discounts from national financial institutions and major retail corporations and subsequently seeks to collect 
in addition  sherman originates subprime credit card receivables through its subsidiary creditone and has a variety of other similar ventures related to consumer assets 
consequently  sherman s results could be adversely impacted by sherman s ability to obtain or renew financing  most of which is renewable annually with the next renewal required in april of  and its ability to accomplish this on reasonable terms  mispricing of the pools of consumer assets it purchases  macroeconomic or other factors that could diminish the success of its collection efforts on the variety of consumer assets it owns  and the results of its credit card origination business  which are sensitive to interest rate changes  charge off losses and the success of its collection efforts  and which may be impacted by macroeconomic factors that affect a borrower s ability to pay 
as a result of their significant amount of collection efforts  there is a risk that sherman could be subject to consumer related lawsuits and other investigations related to fair debt collection practices  which could have an adverse effect on sherman s income  reputation and future ability to conduct business 
in addition  sherman is particularly exposed to consumer credit risk as a result of its credit card origination business and unsecured lending business through creditone 
national credit card lenders recently have reported decreased spending by card members and an increase in delinquencies and loan write offs as a result of the on going turmoil in the consumer credit markets 
a continuation of current economic trends could materially impact the future results of sherman  which  in turn  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
sherman s principal credit facility  which sherman uses to fund the consumer assets it purchases  is scheduled to expire in april sherman may not be able to renew this facility on reasonable terms  if at all 
if sherman is unable to renew the facility  sherman could lose access to the funds it needs to continue its purchasing activities and to grow its core servicing businesses 
our international operations subject us to risks 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our international mortgage insurance and financial guaranty business activities  including dependence on regulatory and third party approvals  foreign governments monetary policies and regulatory requirements  economic downturns in targeted foreign mortgage origination markets  interest rate volatility in a variety of countries  political risk and risks of war  terrorism  civil disturbances or other events that may limit or disrupt markets  
table of contents the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign regulations and laws  some of which are materially different than the regulatory and statutory requirements we face in our domestic business  and which may change unexpectedly  potentially adverse tax consequences  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
given our current strategic focus on domestic mortgage insurance  we have ceased writing new international business other than limited mortgage reinsurance transactions in australia and are seeking to reduce our existing international exposures 
in certain cases  our ability to reduce our exposure depends on our counterparty s ability to find alternative insurance  which opportunities are limited in the current global economic downturn 
accordingly  we may not be able to recover the capital we invested in our international operations for many years and may not recover all of such capital if losses are worse than expected 
further  any one or more of the risks listed above could limit or prohibit us from effectively running off our international operations 
we may lose business if we are unable to meet our customers technological demands 
participants in the mortgage insurance industry rely on e commerce and other technologies to provide and expand their products and services 
our customers generally require that we provide aspects of our products and services electronically  and the percentage of our new insurance written and claims processing that we deliver electronically has continued to increase 
we expect this trend to continue and  accordingly  we may be unable to satisfy our customers requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or otherwise are unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities 
this may result in a decrease in the business we receive  which could impact our profitability 
our information technology systems may not be configured to process information regarding new and emerging products 
many of our information technology systems  which have been in place for a number of years  originally were designed to process information regarding traditional products 
as new products with new features emerge or when we modify our underwriting standards as we have done recently  our systems may require modification in order to recognize these features to allow us to price or bill for our insurance of these products appropriately 
our systems also may not be capable of recording  or may incorrectly record  information about these products that may be important to our risk management and other functions 
in addition  our customers may encounter similar technological issues that prevent them from sending us complete information about the products or transactions that we insure 
making appropriate modifications to our systems involves inherent time lags and may require us to incur significant expenses 
the inability to make necessary modifications to our systems in a timely and cost effective manner may have adverse effects on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we could be adversely affected if personal information that we maintain on consumers is improperly disclosed 
as part of our business  we and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates maintain large amounts of personal information on consumers 
while we believe we have appropriate information security policies and systems to prevent unauthorized disclosure  there can be no assurance that unauthorized disclosure  either through the actions of third parties or our employees  will not occur 
unauthorized disclosure could adversely affect our reputation and expose us to material claims for damages 

table of contents we are subject to the risk of private litigation and regulatory proceedings 
we face litigation risk in the ordinary course of operations  including the risk of class action lawsuits 
in august and september  two purported stockholder class action lawsuits  cortese v 
radian group inc and maslar v 
radian group inc  were filed against radian group and individual defendants in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the complaints  which are substantially similar  allege that we were aware of and failed to disclose the actual financial condition of c bass prior to our declaration of a material impairment to our investment in c bass 
on january   the court ordered that the cases be consolidated into in re radian securities litigation and appointed the institutional investors iron workers local no 
pension fund and the city of ann arbor employees retirement system lead plaintiffs in the case 
in april  a consolidated and amended complaint was filed  adding one additional defendant 
on june   we filed a motion to dismiss this case  and on december   oral arguments were held on this motion 
we are currently awaiting a final ruling on this motion 
while it is still very early in the pleadings stage  we do not believe that the allegations in the consolidated cases have any merit and we intend to defend against this action vigorously 
in april  a purported class action lawsuit was filed against radian group  the compensation and human resources committee of our board of directors and individual defendants in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the complaint alleges violations of the employee retirement income securities act as it relates to our savings incentive plan 
the named plaintiff is a former employee of ours 
on july   we filed a motion to dismiss this case 
the court heard oral arguments on our motion to dismiss on december   and we are awaiting a final ruling 
we believe that the allegations are without merit  and intend to defend against this action vigorously 
in june  we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania  naming indymac  deutsche bank national trust company  fgic  ambac and mbia insurance corporation as defendants 
the suit involves three of our pool policies covering second lien mortgages  entered into in late and early with respect to loans originated by indymac 
we are in a second loss position behind indymac and in front of three defendant financial guaranty companies 
we are alleging that the representations and warranties made to us to induce us to issue the policies were materially false  and that as a result  the policies should be void 
the total amount of our claim liability is approximately million 
indymac and the fdic  which now controls indymac  have obtained a stay of this action until march  also in june  indymac filed a suit against us in california state court in los angeles on the same policies  alleging that we have wrongfully denied claims or rescinded coverage on the underlying loans 
this action was subsequently dismissed without prejudice 
there are related suits between fgic and indymac in california and the southern district of new york which may also be consolidated with our suit at a later date 
in addition to the above litigation  we are involved in litigation that has arisen in the normal course of our business 
we are contesting the allegations in each such pending action and believe  based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel  that the outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in the future  we cannot predict whether other actions might be brought against us 
any such proceedings could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  we received a letter from the staff of the chicago regional office of the sec stating that the staff is conducting an investigation involving radian group and requesting production of certain documents 
we believe that the investigation generally relates to our proposed  but now terminated  merger with mgic and our investment in c bass 
we are in the process of providing responsive documents and information to the securities and exchange commission 

table of contents see also legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our mortgage insurance business  legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our financial guaranty business and the irs is examining our tax returns for the years through the irs is examining our tax returns for the years through we are currently under examination by the irs for the through tax years 
the irs opposes the recognition of certain tax losses and deductions that were generated through our investment in a portfolio of residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics and has proposed adjustments denying the associated tax benefits of these items 
we are contesting all such proposed adjustments relating to the irs s opposition of the tax benefits in question and are working with tax counsel in our defense efforts 
we have received the revenue agent report relating to the through tax years which proposes an increase to our tax liability of approximately million and  in response to that report  have made a qualified deposit with the us treasury under internal revenue code irc section of approximately million to avoid the accrual of the above market rate interest associated with our estimate of the potentially unsettled adjustment 
although we disagree with and will contest the adjustments proposed by the irs  and believe that our income and loss from these investments was properly reported on our federal income tax returns in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations in effect during the periods involved  there can be no assurance that we will prevail in opposing additional tax liability with respect to this investment 
the examination process and any appeals we may pursue may take some time  and a final resolution may not be reached until a date many months or years into the future 
additionally  although we believe  after discussions with outside counsel about the issues raised in the examination and the procedures for resolution of the disputed adjustments  that an adequate provision for income taxes has been made for potential liabilities that may result  if the outcome of this matter results in liability that differs materially from our expectations  it could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and cash flows 
we have concluded that no valuation allowance is required with regard to our deferred tax asset dta which is on our balance sheet at december  at million statement of financial accounting standards no 
requires an enterprise to reduce its dta by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the dta will not be realized 
at each balance sheet date  we assess the requirement to establish a valuation allowance 
this assessment  along with the level of a potential valuation allowance  is made based on all available information  including tax planning strategies and projections of future taxable income 
projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that may differ from actual experience 
based on our analysis at december   we believe that we will ultimately possess sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character so that it is more likely than not that our dta will be realized 
our analysis in making this determination includes our net operating and capital loss carryback potential  a viable tax planning strategy  the reversal of temporary differences relating to our financial guaranty derivatives and the reversal of temporary differences relating to our unrealized losses in our investment portfolio 
if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income prove to be incorrect  or future market events occur that prevent our ability to hold financial instruments with unrealized losses to recovery  a valuation allowance could be required to be recognized 
recognition of a valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our mortgage insurance business 
our business and legal liabilities are affected by the application of federal or state consumer lending and insurance laws and regulations  or by unfavorable changes in these laws and regulations 
for example  the housing and economic recovery act includes reforms to the fha  which provide the fha with greater flexibility in establishing new products and increased the fha s competitive position against private mortgage insurers 
this new law increased the maximum loan amount that the fha can insure and established a higher 
table of contents minimum cash down payment 
the housing and economic recovery act also contained provisions  called the hope for homeownership program  in which the fha is authorized to refinance distressed mortgages in return for lenders and investors agreeing to write down the amount of the original mortgage 
the recently enacted emergency economic stabilization act and the recently announced homeowner affordability and stability plan include provisions that encourage further use of the hope for homeowners program and further strengthen support for fha programs by easing restrictions in these programs 
we cannot predict with any certainty the long term impact of these changes upon demand for our products 
however  we believe the fha has materially increased its market share in  in part by insuring a number of loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines  as a result of these recent legislative and regulatory changes 
see our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition above 
any further increase in the competition we face from the fha or any other government sponsored entities could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we and other mortgage insurers have faced private lawsuits alleging  among other things  that our captive reinsurance arrangements constitute unlawful payments to mortgage lenders under the anti referral fee provisions of respa and that we have failed to comply with the notice provisions of the fair credit reporting act fcra 
in addition  class action lawsuits have been brought against a number of large lenders alleging that their captive reinsurance arrangements violated respa 
while we are not currently a defendant in any case related to respa or fcra  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to any future litigation under respa or fcra or that the outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse affect on us 
we and other mortgage insurers have been subject to inquiries from the new york insurance department and the minnesota department of commerce relating to our captive reinsurance and contract underwriting arrangements  and we have also received a subpoena from the office of the inspector general of hud  requesting information relating to captive reinsurance 
we cannot predict whether these inquiries will lead to further inquiries  or further investigations of these arrangements  or the scope  timing or outcome of the present inquiries or any other inquiry or action by these or other regulators 
although we believe that all of our captive reinsurance and contract underwriting arrangements comply with applicable legal requirements  we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend against any alleged violations of respa or other laws 
proposed changes to the application of respa could harm our competitive position 
hud proposed an exemption under respa for lenders that  at the time a borrower submits a loan application  give the borrower a firm  guaranteed price for all the settlement services associated with the loan  commonly referred to as bundling 
in  hud indicated its intention to abandon the proposed rule and to submit a revised proposed rule to the us congress 
hud began looking at the reform process again in and a new rule was proposed in we do not know what form  if any  this rule will take or whether it will be promulgated 
in addition  hud has also declared its intention to seek legislative changes to respa 
we cannot predict which changes will be implemented and whether the premiums we are able to charge for mortgage insurance will be negatively affected 
legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our financial guaranty business 
the laws and regulations affecting the municipal  asset backed and trade credit debt markets  as well as other governmental regulations  may be changed in ways that could adversely affect our business 
our regulators are reviewing the laws  rules and regulations applicable to financial guarantors in light of the current market disruptions 
these reviews could result in additional limitations on our ability to conduct our financial guaranty business  including additional restrictions and limitations on our ability to declare dividends or more stringent statutory capital requirements for all or certain segments of our financial guaranty businesses 
any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents the implementation of the basel ii capital accord may discourage the use of mortgage insurance

on june   we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania  naming indymac  deutsche bank national trust company  fgic  ambac and mbia insurance corporation as defendants 
the suit involves three of our pool policies covering second lien mortgages  entered into in late and early with respect to loans originated by indymac 
we are in a second loss position behind indymac and in front of three defendant financial guaranty companies 
we are alleging that the representations and warranties made to us to induce us to issue the policies were materially 
table of contents false  and that as a result  the policies should be void 
the total amount of our claim liability is approximately million 
we have established loss reserves equal to the total amount of our exposure to these transactions

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item and the risk factors detailed in item a of part i of this report 
business summary overview we are a credit enhancement company with a primary strategic focus on domestic first lien residential mortgage insurance 
our business segments are mortgage insurance  financial guaranty and financial services 
mortgage insurance our mortgage insurance segment provides credit related insurance coverage  principally through private mortgage insurance  and risk management services to mortgage lending institutions located throughout the united states us and in select countries outside the us we have provided these products and services mainly through our wholly owned subsidiaries  radian guaranty inc  amerin guaranty corporation  and radian insurance inc which we refer to as radian guaranty  amerin guaranty  and radian insurance  respectively 
of these companies  radian guaranty is currently the only company through which we are continuing to write a significant amount of new business 
private mortgage insurance protects mortgage lenders from all or a portion of default related losses on residential mortgage loans made mostly to home buyers who make down payments of less than of the home s purchase price 
private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market  most of which are sold to freddie mac and federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
we refer to freddie mac and fannie mae as government sponsored enterprises or gses 
traditional mortgage insurance 
our mortgage insurance segment  through radian guaranty  offers primary and pool mortgage insurance coverage on first lien residential mortgages 
at december   primary insurance on domestic first lien mortgages made up approximately of our total domestic first lien mortgage insurance risk in force  and pool insurance on domestic first lien mortgages made up approximately of our total domestic first lien mortgage insurance risk in force 
currently  traditional primary mortgage insurance on domestic  first lien residential mortgages is our primary business focus 
non traditional mortgage credit enhancement 
in addition to traditional mortgage insurance  in the past we have used radian insurance to provide other forms of credit enhancement on residential mortgage assets 
these products include mortgage insurance on second lien mortgages second lien  credit enhancement on net interest margin securities nims  credit default swaps cds on domestic and international mortgages  and traditional mortgage insurance in international markets collectively  we refer to the risk associated with these transactions as non traditional or other risk 
these non traditional or other risk products were once a growing part of our total mortgage insurance business 
however  in light of the on going deterioration in housing and related credit markets  we stopped writing all non traditional business in  other than a small amount of international mortgage insurance 
international mortgage insurance operations 
through radian insurance  we wrote i credit protection in the form of international credit default swaps primarily on two large aaa tranches of mortgage backed securities  one containing german mortgages and one containing danish mortgages  ii traditional mortgage insurance with standard chartered bank in hong kong  and iii several mortgage reinsurance transactions in australia 
we terminated the danish credit default swap transaction representing approximately billion in notional value in the fourth quarter of ratings downgrades of radian insurance have significantly reduced our ability to continue to write international mortgage insurance business 
in addition  as a result of the downgrades  the counterparties to each 
table of contents of our active international transactions have the right to terminate these transactions  which could require us to return unearned premiums or transfer unearned premiums to a replacement insurer 
on march   standard chartered bank in hong kong informed us that they wished to terminate their contract for new business with radian insurance 
there is a possibility that radian insurance could be required to return unearned premiums related to this transaction to standard chartered bank  or to transfer such unearned premiums to another insurer 
in addition  we have used radian guaranty to assume or reinsure most of our australian transactions 
financial guaranty our financial guaranty business has mainly provided direct insurance and reinsurance on credit based risks through radian asset assurance inc radian asset assurance  a wholly owned subsidiary of radian guaranty  and through radian asset assurance s wholly owned subsidiary radian asset assurance limited raal  located in the united kingdom 
financial guaranty insurance typically provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty to the holder of a financial obligation of full and timely payment of principal and interest when due 
financial guaranty insurance may be issued at the inception of an insured obligation or may be issued for the benefit of a holder of an obligation in the secondary market 
historically  financial guaranty insurance has been used to lower an issuer s cost of borrowing when the insurance premium is less than the value of the spread commonly referred to as the credit spread between the market yield required to be paid on the insured obligation carrying the credit rating of the insurer and the market yield required to be paid on the obligation if sold on the basis of its uninsured credit rating 
financial guaranty insurance also has been used to increase the marketability of obligations issued by infrequent or unknown issuers or obligations with complex structures 
until recently  investors generally have benefited from financial guaranty insurance through increased liquidity in the secondary market  reduced exposure to price volatility caused by changes in the credit quality of the underlying insured issue  and added protection against loss in the event of the obligor s default on its obligation 
recent market developments  including ratings downgrades of most financial guaranty insurance companies including our own  have significantly reduced the perceived benefits of financial guaranty insurance 
we have provided financial guaranty credit protection either through the issuance of a financial guaranty insurance policy or through credit default swaps 
either form of credit enhancement can provide the purchaser of such credit protection with a guaranty of the timely payment of interest and scheduled principal when due on a covered financial obligation 
by providing credit default swaps  we have been able to participate in transactions with superior collateral quality involving asset classes such as corporate collateralized debt obligations cdos that may not have been available to us through the issuance of a traditional financial guaranty insurance policy 
either form of credit enhancement requires substantially identical underwriting and surveillance skills 
we have traditionally offered the following financial guaranty products public finance insurance of public finance obligations  including tax exempt and taxable indebtedness of states  counties  cities  special service districts  other political subdivisions and for enterprises such as airports  public and private higher education and health care facilities  and for project finance and private finance initiative assets in sectors such as schools  healthcare and infrastructure projects 
the issuers of our insured public finance obligations were generally rated investment grade at the time we issued our insurance policy  without the benefit of our insurance  structured finance insurance of structured finance obligations  including cdos and asset backed securities abs  consisting of funded and non funded referred to herein as synthetic executions that are payable from or tied to the performance of a specific pool of assets or covered reference entities 
examples of the pools of assets that underlie structured finance obligations include corporate 
table of contents loans  bonds or other borrowed money  residential and commercial mortgages  diversified payment rights  a variety of consumer loans  equipment receivables  real and personal property leases or a combination of asset classes or securities backed by one or more of these pools of assets 
we have also guaranteed excess clearing losses of securities exchange clearinghouses 
the structured finance obligations we insure were generally rated investment grade at the time we issued our insurance policy  without the benefit of our insurance  and reinsurance reinsurance of domestic and international public finance obligations  including those issued by sovereign and sub sovereign entities  and structured finance obligations 
in october  we exited the trade credit reinsurance line of business 
accordingly  this line of business was placed into run off and we ceased initiating new trade credit reinsurance contracts 
we have also been novating or cancelling several of the trade credit insurance agreements that were in place 
in march  we discontinued writing new insurance on synthetic cdos and reduced significantly our structured products operations 
this action was based on the deterioration and uncertainties in the credit markets in which we and other financial guarantors participate  which significantly reduced the volume of cdos and other structured products available for our insurance 
subsequent to this  in june  both standard poor s ratings service s p and moody s investor service moody s downgraded the financial strength ratings of our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries  and in august  s p again lowered the financial strength ratings on our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries 
see ratings recent ratings actions below 
these downgrades  combined with the difficult market conditions for financial guaranty insurance  severely limited our ability to write profitable new direct financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance both domestically and internationally 
accordingly  in the third quarter of  we decided to discontinue  for the foreseeable future  writing any new financial guaranty business  including accepting new financial guaranty reinsurance  other than as may be necessary to commute  restructure  hedge or otherwise mitigate losses or reduce exposure in our existing portfolio 
we initiated plans to reduce our financial guaranty operations  including a reduction of our workforce  commensurate with this decision 
we also contributed the outstanding capital stock of radian asset assurance to radian guaranty  strengthening radian guaranty s statutory capital 
we continue to maintain a large insured financial guaranty portfolio  including a portfolio of insured cdos 
as a result of s p s downgrades of our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries in june and august  billion of our net par outstanding as of december  remains subject to recapture or termination at the option of our reinsurance customers  our credit derivative counterparties or other insured parties 
all but one of our reinsurance customers have the right to take back or recapture business previously ceded to us under their reinsurance agreements with us  and in some cases  in lieu of recapture  the right to increase ceding commissions charged to us 
as of december   up to billion of our total net assumed par outstanding was subject to recapture 
if all of this business was recaptured as of december   we estimate that we would have experienced a reduction in written premiums of approximately million  earned premiums of approximately million  and the net present value of expected future installment premiums of million 
in addition  we would have experienced a reduction in incurred losses of up to million if this business were recaptured 
the counterparty in two of our synthetic cdo transactions  with an aggregate net par outstanding of million million of which is scheduled to terminate in june  has the right to terminate these transactions with settlement on a mark to market basis  subject to a maximum payment amount as of december  of approximately million in the aggregate 
in addition  we also have million in exposure to another synthetic cdo transaction which is scheduled to terminate in june this transaction may be terminated on a mark to market basis if s p lowers radian asset assurance s financial strength rating below investment grade bbb 

table of contents as of december   the counterparties to of financial guaranty s transactions currently have the right to terminate these transactions without our having an obligation to settle the transaction on a mark to market basis 
if all of these counterparties had terminated these transactions as of december   our net par outstanding would have been reduced by billion  with a corresponding decrease in unearned premium reserves of million of which only million would be required to be refunded to counterparties and the present value of expected future installment premiums of million 
if all these transactions were terminated  we do not believe it would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
financial services our financial services segment mainly consists of our equity interest in sherman financial group llc sherman  a consumer asset and servicing firm 
in august  our equity interest in sherman increased to from as a result of a reallocation of the equity ownership of sherman following a sale by mortgage guaranty insurance corporation mgic of its remaining interest in sherman back to sherman 
as a result of sherman s repurchase of mgic s interests  our investment in affiliates decreased by million million after taxes and is reflected as a reduction in our equity 
our financial services segment also includes our interest in credit based asset servicing and securitization llc c bass  a mortgage investment company which we have written off completely and whose operations are currently in run off 
sherman 
sherman is a consumer asset and servicing firm specializing in charged off and bankruptcy plan consumer assets  which are generally unsecured  that sherman typically purchases at deep discounts from national financial institutions and major retail corporations and subsequently seeks to collect 
in addition  sherman originates subprime credit card receivables through its subsidiary creditone and has a variety of other similar ventures related to consumer assets 
c bass 
historically  c bass was engaged as a mortgage investment and servicing company specializing in the credit risk of subprime single family residential mortgages 
as a result of the disruption in the subprime mortgage market during  c bass ceased purchasing mortgages and mortgage securities and its securitization activities in the third quarter of and sold its loan servicing platform in the fourth quarter of the run off of c bass s business is dictated by an override agreement to which we and all of c bass s other owners and creditors are parties 
this agreement provides the basis for the collection and distribution of cash generated from c bass s whole loans and securities portfolio  as well as the sale of certain assets  including the loan servicing platform 
we recorded a full write off of our equity interest in c bass in the third quarter of and wrote off our million credit facility with c bass in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a consequence of the complete write off of our investment in c bass in  we have no continuing interest of value in c bass 
the effect of c bass on our financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended december   was negligible 
we have no contractual obligations to c bass or its creditors to fund c bass s shareholders deficit as of december  or continuing losses in or thereafter 
all of c bass s business is currently in run off and we anticipate that all future cash flows of c bass will be used to service the outstanding debt 
given its approximately billion shareholders deficit as of december   the likelihood that we will recoup any of our investment is extremely remote 
accordingly  we believe that the chance that our investments in c bass will have anything more than a negligible impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows at any time in the future is extremely remote

s p stated that it had lowered its ratings for these entities based on the diminished business prospects for our financial guaranty business and our intention to use this business to provide capital support to our mortgage insurance business 
on december   s p placed its ratings for radian group and our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries on creditwatch with negative implications 
s p intends to resolve its creditwatch status for these ratings by re evaluating its estimate of expected losses for our mortgage insurance portfolio and by performing an industry wide review that incorporates operating results for the fourth quarter of and developments in macroeconomic conditions 
on december   s p downgraded radian group to bb following completion of the initial stage of its review 
s p s ratings for our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries remained unchanged 
the ratings for radian group and our mortgage and financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries remain on creditwatch with negative implications while s p performs the second stage of its analysis  which it expects to complete in march and which could result in a substantial downgrade 
our current ratings and the threat of further ratings actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations 
see risk factors we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise 
overview of business results as a seller of credit protection  our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the production environment and credit performance of our underlying insured assets 
the current downturn in the housing and related credit markets  characterized by a continuing decline in home prices in certain markets  deteriorating credit performance of mortgage and other assets and reduced liquidity for many participants in the mortgage and financial services industries  has had  and we believe will continue to have  a significant negative impact on the operating environment and results of operations for each of our business segments 
there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding our ultimate loss performance 
the potential for a deepening and prolonged recession in the us  including rising unemployment rates  may add further stress to the performance of our insured assets 
in addition  our performance may be impacted by private and governmental initiatives to support homeowners and to stimulate the economy 
mortgage insurance traditional mortgage insurance defaults 
further deterioration in the us housing and mortgage credit markets throughout resulted in an increase in first lien primary defaults from  at december  to  at december  overall  the underlying trend of higher defaults continues to be driven by poor performance of our late through early books of business 
losses have increased across all of our mortgage insurance product lines and most recently have included increasing losses from prime mortgages 
ongoing deterioration in markets in california and florida  where housing values have declined significantly  continues to have a significant negative impact on our mortgage insurance business results 
in light of current market trends  we expect new first lien defaults to continue to increase in loss provision first lien premium deficiency 
in addition to the increase in new defaults during  our mortgage insurance loss provision at december  continued to be negatively impacted by higher loan balances on delinquent loans  higher rates of defaults moving into claim status  a decrease 
table of contents in the cure rate of defaults and an increase in claims paid 
in  we paid total claims of million  representing a increase over the million of claims paid in we expect that claims paid will significantly increase in to between billion and billion 
recent legislation and loan modification programs by the us treasury and certain of our lender customers aimed at mitigating the current housing downturn could have a positive impact on our business by potentially reducing the number of defaults going to claim 
many of these programs are in the early stages of implementation and we cannot be certain of their impact on our business  results of operations  or the timing of any potential impact 
accordingly  we have not incorporated any such potential benefit into our projections 
see risk factors loan modification and other similar programs may not provide us with a material benefit 
in the second quarter of  we established a first lien premium deficiency reserve of million on our outstanding domestic first lien mortgage insurance portfolio 
a premium deficiency reserve was established because the projected net present value of expenses and losses for our first lien portfolio exceeded the net present value of future premiums and the loss reserve on this portfolio 
during the second half of  the first lien premium deficiency reserve was reduced to primarily as a result of increased loss reserves recorded on our domestic first lien mortgage insurance portfolio 
management s assessment of whether  and to what extent  a premium deficiency may exist at any given point in time is based largely on management s estimate of future losses  which depends on a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainty and which may prove inaccurate in the current economic environment 
see risk factors if the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves for our mortgage insurance or financial guaranty business are incorrect we may be required to take unexpected charges to income and our ratings may be downgraded 
smart home captives 
we have protected against some of our future expected losses relating to riskier products that we insure by reinsuring our exposure through transactions referred to as smart home that effectively transfer risk to investors in the capital markets 
approximately of our primary mortgage insurance risk in force was included in smart home transactions at december  our mortgage insurance provision for losses for the year ended december  was reduced by million due to recoverables from smart home 
ceded losses recoverable related to smart home were million at december  in addition to smart home  we transfer a substantial portion of our mortgage insurance risk to captive reinsurance companies affiliated with our lender customers 
we currently have active captive reinsurance agreements in which new business continues to be placed 
we also have captive reinsurance arrangements operating on a run off basis  meaning that no new business is being placed in these captives 
our mortgage insurance provision for losses for the year ended december  was reduced by million due to recoverables from captive reinsurance transactions 
ceded losses recoverable on captive reinsurance transactions were million at december  in light of the significant amount of ultimate losses we expect to incur in our mortgage insurance business  we expect to receive total reinsurance recoveries from smart home and captive reinsurance of approximately million 
new insurance written 
we experienced a decrease in traditional flow business written during the year ended december   compared to overall  primary new insurance written  which includes both structured and flow business  decreased by for the year ended december   compared to this decrease is mainly the result of a decrease in the volume of mortgage originations during the current housing and economic downturn  our more restrictive underwriting guidelines  the absence of a secondary market for mortgage securitizations and increased competition from the federal housing administration fha 
throughout  we implemented a series of changes to our underwriting guidelines aimed at improving the long term risk profile and profitability of our business 
as a result of these changes  we have experienced a positive shift in our overall business mix 
for the year ended december   approximately of our new business production was categorized as prime business compared to for persistency 
the persistency rate  which is defined as the percentage of insurance in force that remains on our books after any month period  was for the year ended december   compared to 
table of contents for the year ended december  this increase was mainly due to a decline in refinancing activity from the high levels in and as a result of home price depreciation  tighter underwriting standards and an overall decrease in the lending capacity among mortgage originators 
we expect that persistency rates will continue to remain at elevated levels as long as the current disruption in the housing and mortgage credit markets continues 
discontinued non traditional products nims 
our exposure to nims was reduced to million at december   compared to million at december   in part due to our purchase of certain nims that we insure 
the performance of loans underlying the nims bonds that we insure continued to deteriorate during of the million in our total exposure to nims  approximately million represents our gross expected principal credit losses related to nims 
claim payments on our insured nims are expected to begin in and to occur mostly in and the fair value of our total net liabilities related to nims as of december  was million 
our carrying value includes the net present value of our total expected credit losses and incorporates the market s perception of our non performance risk  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas no 

in the fourth quarter of  as a risk mitigation initiative  we began purchasing nims that we insure at a discount to par 
these efforts continued during  resulting in an overall reduction of our risk in force related to nims of million during we did not purchase any nims prior to the fourth quarter of the nims purchased are accounted for as derivative assets and are recorded at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted 
upon purchase  our liability representing the unrealized loss associated with the purchased nims is eliminated 
the difference between the amount we pay for the nims and the sum of the fair value of the nims and the eliminated liability represents the net impact to earnings 
the overall impact to our financial statements as a result of these purchases has been immaterial 
second lien mortgages 
we experienced further deterioration in our second lien portfolio during  which resulted in a million increase in second lien loss reserves to approximately million 
our premium deficiency reserve for second liens decreased during by million due  in part  to a negotiated settlement which resulted in a reduction in our second lien premium deficiency reserve of million  as discussed below  resulting in a total premium deficiency reserve for second liens of approximately million at december  as of december   our total exposure to second liens was million  compared to million at december  as of december   we held reserves  including our second lien premium deficiency reserve  of million against our total second lien mortgage portfolio  representing approximately of the total exposure 
in january  we executed a settlement on certain second lien mortgage insurance transactions  comprising the worst performing second lien collateral in our portfolio 
this settlement reduced our risk in force by approximately million to approximately million 
the settlement amount was million less than our reserve amount  and as a result  we reduced our second lien premium deficiency reserve through the provision for premium deficiency by million at december   related to this settlement 
credit default swaps 
as of december   our total mortgage insurance risk in force related to domestic cds on residential mortgage backed securities rmbs was approximately million 
the total fair value liability for these transactions at december  was million  compared to our estimate of future credit losses of million 
similar to our nims  the difference between the fair value liability for these transactions and our expected credit losses is mainly attributable to the incorporation of the market s perception of our credit risk in computing fair value as required by sfas no 

table of contents with respect to our international cds  we reduced our total risk in force exposure to these transactions by approximately billion to billion at december  as a result of the termination of a large transaction in the fourth quarter of our exposure to international mortgage insurance cds at december  consists of two cdss referencing rmbs bonds related to mortgage loans in germany and the netherlands 
the first cds contains prime  low ltv mortgages originated in germany 
our remaining exposure to this transaction  which is rated aaa  was approximately billion as of december   with remaining subordination of approximately million 
the second transaction contains prime  low ltv mortgages originated in the netherlands 
our remaining exposure to this transaction was approximately million as of december   with remaining subordination of million 
we have insured several tranches in the netherlands transaction which are rated between bbb and aaa  with over half of our exposure in the aaa category 
both of these transactions are performing well and we do not currently expect to pay claims on either of these transactions 
as of december   we had a fair value liability of million on our remaining international cds transactions 
financial guaranty new business production 
a difficult business environment for financial guaranty insurance has existed since these conditions include the widening of credit spreads  a lack of price transparency and illiquidity in many of the structured products that we insure 
in addition  there were losses by financial guarantors on rmbs  cdos of abs and other credit positions  ratings actions on financial guaranty industry participants  including us  and perceived instability in the franchise values and ratings of many of the financial guarantors  including us 
these conditions have materially diminished the financial benefit that our credit protection provides to issuers in the current  market of both public and structured finance transactions and to our primary insurer customers and have reduced the perceived benefit of our insurance to holders of insured debt 
many transactions that would normally have been marketed with some form of financial guaranty insurance are either not going to market or are being sold without the benefit of financial guaranty insurance 
as a result  there has been a significant reduction in the volume of transactions for which financial guaranty insurance is a viable option  which has made it more difficult for us and many other financial guarantors to write new business 
these conditions also resulted in fewer opportunities to obtain reinsurance business from our primary insurance customers 
consequently  new business production across all of our financial guaranty product lines was significantly reduced in as discussed above  in the third quarter of  we decided to discontinue  for the foreseeable future  writing any new financial guaranty business  including accepting new financial guaranty reinsurance  other than as may be necessary to commute  restructure  hedge or otherwise mitigate losses or reduce exposure in our existing portfolio 
reductions in net par outstanding 
our financial guaranty net par outstanding decreased by from billion as of december  to billion as of december  this reduction in outstanding net par was primarily due to recaptures of reinsurance business by certain of our primary reinsurance customers  terminations of certain cdo obligations  prepayments or refundings of public finance transactions and the amortization or scheduled maturity of our insured portfolio 
as a result of the downgrade of radian asset assurance s financial strength ratings by s p in june  four of our reinsurance customers recaptured all of their business ceded to us and we agreed to allow another reinsurance customer to take back a portion of its business the fg recaptures 
as a result of these transactions  our net assumed par outstanding  written premiums  earned premiums and net present value of expected future installment premiums were reduced in the aggregate by billion  million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents as a result of the downgrade of radian asset assurance s financial strength ratings by s p to bbb in august  the counterparties in four of our synthetic credit default swap transactions obtained the right to terminate the transactions with settlement on a mark to market basis 
in september  we voluntarily terminated one of these transactions and novated a second transaction to an unaffiliated third party before the termination rights for our counterparty vested  with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
credit performance 
we have experienced deterioration in our financial guaranty portfolio during  primarily related to deterioration in housing and consumer finance markets 
the performance of assumed structured finance transactions within our reinsurance portfolio deteriorated throughout and one large public finance reinsurance credit defaulted during the deterioration in our insured abs portfolio was primarily related to credits supported by student loan and rental car collateral  while the deterioration in our insured rmbs portfolio was primarily related to domestic subprime and alternative a alt a collateral 
as of december   of our domestic insured rmbs portfolio was rated below investment grade 
while we did not experience material deterioration in our directly insured portfolio  there was some ratings deterioration within our insured corporate cdo portfolio and trust preferred cdo portfolio due to the impact of several credit events in the second half of we moved one large directly insured cdo of abs with significant rmbs exposure in its underlying collateral pool to our watch list in there has been some credit deterioration in our insured healthcare portfolio during  primarily due to the impact of investment losses resulting from the market downturn on hospitals cash positions  and in our insured education portfolio due to declining philanthropy and investment returns 
in addition  some of our healthcare and education credits have also been experiencing additional stress due to interest rate volatility and the risk of rapid amortization associated with recent disruptions in the auction rate and variable rate bond markets

credit spreads on underlying collateral  both corporate credit spreads and asset backed spreads  widened significantly during  which would have resulted in large unrealized losses on these positions 
offsetting these losses  however  is the impact of a change to our valuation methodology  effective january   that incorporates the market s perception of our non performance risk 
this change in methodology is required under the provisions of sfas no 
given the significant widening of our credit default swap spread since early  the reduction in the valuation of our derivative liabilities related to our non performance risk more than offset the credit spread widening on underlying collateral for these two drivers of our fair values can move in tandem  or in opposite directions  and this unpredictability could contribute to significant continued volatility of our operating results

includes   and  defaults at december   december  and december   respectively  where reserves have not been established because no claim payment is currently anticipated 
we generally do not establish reserves for loans that are in default if we do not believe we will be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default 
for example  for those defaults in which we are in a second loss position  we calculate what the reserve would have been if there had been no deductible 
if the existing deductible is greater than the reserve amount for any given default  we do not establish a reserve for the default 
the default and claim cycle in the mortgage insurance business begins with our receipt of a default notice from the insured 
generally  the insured notifies us of a default within days after the loan has become days past due 
for reporting and internal tracking purposes  we do not consider a loan to be in default until the loan has been in default for days

historically  relatively few claims on prime business are received during the first two years following issuance of a policy and on non prime business during the first year 
claim activity on prime loans has historically reached its highest level in the third through fifth years after the year of policy origination  and on non prime loans this level is expected to be reached in the second through fourth years 
based on these trends  approximately of our primary risk in force and approximately of our pool risk in force at december  had not yet reached its highest claim frequency years 
at december   the comparable amounts were and  respectively 
the business written from late through the first half of has experienced default and claim activity sooner than has been the case for historical books of business 
because it is difficult to predict both the timing of originating new business and the cancellation rate of existing business  it is also difficult to predict  at any given time  the percentage of risk in force that will reach its highest claim frequency years on any future date 
year ended december in thousands states with highest claims paid st lien california michigan florida ohio georgia percentage of total claims paid california michigan florida ohio georgia claims paid in california and florida have increased significantly as home price depreciation in those states has been at a much greater level than the national average 
those states also contain a higher percentage of alt a loans  which have had a higher claim frequency 
we believe that claims in the midwest and southeast have been rising and will continue to rise due to the weak industrial sector of the economy in those areas 
a much higher

table of contents other income 
other income was million for both and provision for losses 
the provision for losses was million for  compared to million for the increase in the provision for losses compared to is mainly the result of on going deterioration in our assumed reinsurance business 
the provision for losses reported for includes a million claim which represented our total exposure and which was paid in on a credit in which we provided market value and credit support for an extendable commercial paper program 
this credit represented the only direct market value transaction then remaining in our financial guaranty portfolio 
we closely monitor our financial guaranty obligations and we use an internal classification process to identify and track troubled credits 
we classify credits as intensified surveillance credits when we determine that continued performance is questionable and  in the absence of a positive change  may result in a claim 
at december   and  our financial guaranty segment had the following exposure on credits classified as intensified surveillance credits december december december of credits par outstanding of credits par outstanding of credits par outstanding in millions less than greater than total we establish loss reserves which include case reserves  allocated non specific and unallocated non specific reserves on our non derivative financial guaranty contracts as discussed in critical accounting policies reserve for losses in this item and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding the four credits with net par outstanding of greater than million that we have classified as intensified surveillance credits as of december  we reinsure million net par outstanding of notes issued by a special purpose vehicle to fund reserves for a pool of life insurance policies 
due to significant deterioration in the market value of the collateral supporting this transaction  which has high concentrations of securities backed by subprime and alt a mortgages  cash flows that would otherwise be available to pay interest on our insured notes have been diverted to increase the statutory reserves for the life insurance policies 
as a result  the primary insurer for this transaction was required to pay a claim related to an interest shortfall on the insured notes 
based upon loss estimates provided by the primary insurer  we established an allocated non specific reserve for this transaction of million at december  we have concluded that no additional loss beyond this amount is probable or estimable 
we provide credit protection on million net par outstanding of the senior most tranche of a cdo of abs transaction  where the underlying collateral consists of mezzanine tranches of predominately mortgage backed securities 
as of december   rmbs credits and cdos of abs credits collectively representing million or of the million collateral pool had been downgraded by s p or moody s and of these credits  with a notional value of million  have defaulted 
the transaction  which is accounted for as a derivative  is currently internally rated ccc  b by s p and ba by moody s 
due to substantial deterioration of the underlying collateral  which has accelerated over the past few quarters  and based on available projections  we currently expect that losses from the remaining collateral will exceed the remaining subordination 
based on current anticipated cash flows  we expect to begin paying unreimbursed claims 
table of contents related to interest shortfalls on this transaction in or later 
due to the structure of this transaction  we do not expect to begin paying claims related to the principal shortfall until sometime between and the legal final maturity date for the transaction in we currently believe that the ultimate principal payment with respect to this transaction will be less than the current outstanding par amount  but due to the long remaining life and nature of the collateral  losses are difficult to estimate 
deterioration in economic conditions over the remaining life of the transaction beyond our current projections could have a material impact on the timing and amount of cash available to make interest and principal payments on our insured tranche  and therefore  our ultimate losses on this transaction could be greater than expected 
we reinsure a portion of one primary financial guarantor s obligations on two securitizations backed by private student loans  a substantial portion of which are auction rate securities 
our net par outstanding as of december  for these transactions  both with a legal final maturity date in  was million and million  respectively 
due to weaker than expected performance of the underlying student loans and escalating interest obligations for the insured notes due to stresses in the auction rate securities market and ratings downgrades of the primary insurer for these transactions  the cash flows  which are increasingly needed to cover current interest payments  may be insufficient to meet our insured obligations in the future 
in addition to the credits identified above  there were additional intensified surveillance credits identified at december  including non derivative financial guaranty credits  representing approximately million in net par outstanding we have established million in allocated non specific reserves for of these non derivative credits 
we have concluded that no additional loss is probable or estimable at this time on these transactions 
other than the one derivative transaction identified above as having more than million in net par outstanding  there were no other derivative transactions with million or greater in net par outstanding as of december  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we do not establish loss reserves on our derivative financial guaranty contracts 
instead  gains and losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts are derived from internally generated models that take into account both credit and market spreads 
we only have one credit with a net par outstanding of greater than million for which we have established a case reserve 
for this credit  we have reinsured several primary financial guaranty insurers obligations with respect to million in net par outstanding related to jefferson county  alabama the county sewer bonds 
the county currently faces increased financing costs on its debt and could possibly face more rapid amortization on its bank liquidity support  which has contributed to financial stress on the county s sewer system 
the county and certain primary insurers entered into forbearance agreements with the liquidity banks  the latest of which are scheduled to expire on april  these agreements prevent the banks from demanding payment of accrued default rate interest under their liquidity agreements or taking other actions to enforce their rights under the liquidity agreements until the expiration of such forbearance agreements 
certain insurers  including the primary financial guaranty insurers  have been working with the county and other parties to structure a resolution to the financial problems of the county s sewer system  and a settlement has been proposed 
it is uncertain whether a solution  including the proposed settlement  can be obtained that is acceptable to all parties before the expiration of the forbearance period  or whether new forbearance agreements will be entered into by the parties 
through december   we have paid million in the aggregate in connection with extensions of the forbearance agreements and for interest payments on the bond which have not been paid 
at december   we had posted a case reserve for this credit of million  net of expected recoveries from salvage 
this case reserve is intended to cover our share of interest and principal payments through july  and our share of a proposed settlement between the county and certain insurers  including the primary financial guaranty insurer 
we have concluded that no additional loss beyond this amount is probable or estimable at this time

contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  including payments under operating lease agreements  are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as liabilities but represent a contractual commitment to pay 
the following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
following the table are other contractual obligations and commitments that do not fall within the categories specified by the securities and exchange commission sec for tabular disclosure

we currently have million in principal amount outstanding under our credit facility  which matures in february we have no unused commitment that we may draw on 
in addition  we have million in debentures due in june  million in senior notes due in february and million in senior notes due in june

our credit agreement  as amended  no longer has a ratings trigger or debt to capital requirement 
under our credit facility as amended  in addition to our business covenants  we are required to maintain subject to certain adjustments  a consolidated net worth of at least billion through june   billion from july  through december  and billion at any time thereafter  in each case  subject to upward adjustment if we receive net proceeds from the issuance of certain securities 
our consolidated net worth under the credit facility is determined by excluding mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments and investments reflected on our financial statements 
at december   our consolidated net worth as determined under the facility was billion 
we expect to incur a net operating loss in  which would negatively impact our consolidated net worth 
in addition  our consolidated net worth would be further reduced if we realize losses in our investment portfolio 
although we do not expect to breach our net worth covenant based on our current loss projections  there can be no assurance that losses in or after will not reduce our consolidated net worth below the minimum amount required by our covenant  which would cause our default under the credit facility 
we would also be in default under our credit facility if  among other things any of our main insurance subsidiaries a fails to meet or maintain minimum levels of statutory capital or surplus  b is prohibited from writing  underwriting  assuming  or reinsuring further business  or c is otherwise prohibited by its regulators from writing or materially restricted from performing any of its core business activities  and in such event  our shared expense reimbursement payments from our subsidiaries do not cover all of our operating expenses and debt service 
we discuss our mortgage insurance statutory surplus and risk to capital or leverage ratios above in risk factors recent losses in our mortgage insurance business have reduced radian guaranty s statutory surplus and increased radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio  additional losses in our mortgage insurance portfolio without a corresponding increase in new capital or capital relief could further negatively impact these ratios  which could limit radian guaranty s ability to write new insurance and could increase restrictions and requirements placed on radian guaranty by the gses or state insurance regulators 
any of our main insurance subsidiaries fails to pay any shared expense reimbursement payment to radian group under our expense sharing arrangements  or an insurance regulatory authority or other governmental authority voids  terminates  prohibits  suspends or otherwise causes to be invalid or ineffective  any of our expense sharing arrangements with our insurance subsidiaries 
if we default under our credit agreement  the agent or the lenders representing a majority of the debt under our credit agreement would have the right to terminate all commitments under the credit agreement and declare the outstanding debt due and payable 
see risk factors our credit facility was amended in  reducing our liquidity and adding additional restrictions on our ability to operate our business

affiliate guaranty agreements 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have entered into the following intra company guarantees radian guaranty and amerin guaranty are parties to a cross guaranty agreement 
this agreement provides that if either party fails to make a payment to a policyholder  then the other party will step in and make the payment 
the obligations of both parties are unconditional and irrevocable  however  no payments may be made without prior approval by the insurance department of the payor s state of domicile  pennsylvania for radian guaranty and illinois for amerin guaranty 
radian guaranty has agreed to maintain radian insurance s tangible net worth at a minimum of million and to cause radian insurance at all times to have sufficient liquidity to meet its current obligations  pursuant to a net worth and liquidity maintenance agreement between the two companies 
radian group has agreed to perform  up to a maximum amount of million  radian guaranty s obligations to radian insurance under the net worth and liquidity maintenance agreement discussed immediately above  in the event that radian guaranty is not able to or permitted by the pennsylvania insurance department to perform under the agreement 
radian group and radian mortgage insurance inc formerly known as cmac of arizona  a subsidiary of radian guaranty  are parties to a guaranty agreement in which radian group has agreed for the benefit of radian mortgage insurance inc s creditors to make funds available on demand for the full and complete payment of all due but unpaid liabilities 
prior to our acquisition of enhance financial services group efsg in  efsg issued a guaranty of payment of the liabilities and obligations of its subsidiary  radian reinsurance bermuda limited  deriving from any insurance or reinsurance contract the enhance guaranty  for the purpose of maintaining certain regulatory solvency and liquidity margin requirements of the bermuda monetary authority 
following our acquisition of efsg  radian group issued a guaranty for the benefit of efsg to make funds available to efsg for its performance of the enhance guaranty  to the extent that efsg is unable to satisfy those obligations 
radian asset assurance and raal are parties to a capital maintenance agreement pursuant to which radian asset assurance has agreed to maintain raal s capital at a level not less that of the equivalent of the required margin of solvency pursuant to the regulations of the financial services authority  raal s uk regulator  and to ensure that at all times raal has sufficient cash resources for the timely honoring of its contractual obligations 
radian asset assurance is not required to make any payments that would cause it to be in breach of its own minimum capital requirements  and certain 
table of contents payments by radian asset assurance pursuant to this agreement are specifically subject to the prior approval of the new york superintendent of insurance 
securities regulations became effective in that impose enhanced disclosure requirements on issuers of asset backed including mortgage backed securities 
to allow our mortgage insurance customers to comply with these regulations  we typically have been required  depending on the amount of credit enhancement we are providing  to provide audited financial statements for the insurance subsidiary participating in these transactions or a full and unconditional holding company level guarantee for our insurance subsidiaries obligations in such transactions 
to date  radian group has guaranteed two structured transactions for radian guaranty with approximately million of remaining credit exposure 
in addition to the foregoing  we use reinsurance from affiliated companies to allow radian guaranty to remain in compliance with insurance regulations that limit the amount of risk that a mortgage insurance company may retain on a single loan to of the indebtedness of the insured 
funding of compensation programs 
under our change of control agreements with our executive officers  upon a change of control of radian group or radian asset assurance  as the case may be  we are required to fund an irrevocable rabbi trust to the extent of our obligations under these agreements 
the total maximum amount that we would be required to place in trust is approximately million as of december  in addition  in the event of a change of control under our existing cash based incentive plans  we would be required to pay approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements the qualifying special purpose entities qspe framework is applicable when an entity transfers sells financial assets to an special purpose entity spe meeting certain criteria defined in sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities sfas no 

these criteria are designed to ensure that the activities of the entity are essentially predetermined at the inception of the vehicle and that the transferor of the financial assets cannot exercise control over the entity and the assets therein 
entities meeting these criteria are not consolidated by the transferor  or other counterparties  as long as they do not have the unilateral ability to liquidate or to cause the entity to no longer meet the qspe criteria 
our interests in qspes may be accounted for as insurance contracts or financial guaranty derivatives 
for insurance contracts with qspes  we record reserves for losses and lae  and for derivative interests in qspes  we record changes in the fair value as a corresponding derivative asset or liability 
we do not record the underlying assets or liabilities of qspes on our balance sheets 
when an spe does not meet the qspe criteria  consolidation is assessed pursuant to fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin r 
under fin r  a vie is defined as an entity that lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  has equity owners that lack the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity s operations  and or has equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb the entity s losses or the right to receive the entity s returns 
fin r requires a variable interest holder ie  a counterparty to a vie to consolidate the vie if that party will receive the majority of the expected residual returns of the vie  absorb a majority of the expected losses of the vie  or both 
this party is considered the primary beneficiary 
spes and vies are a part of our non traditional mortgage insurance products as well as our financial guaranty business 
our primary involvement with spes relates to transactions in which we provide a financial 
table of contents guaranty to one or more classes of beneficial interest holders in the spe 
underlying collateral in the spes typically includes residential or commercial mortgages  consumer receivables  securities and other financial assets sold to a spe and repackaged into securities or similar beneficial interests 
spes may also be used to create securities with a unique risk profile desired by investors and as a means of transferring risk  such as our smart home transactions 
we consolidate those vies in which we are the primary beneficiary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of spes 
certain other spes do not meet the requirements of a qspe  because all of their activities are not sufficiently limited or they have entered into certain non qualifying transactions 
in some circumstances  a qspe may not be exempt from consolidation if we have the unilateral ability to make significant changes to the qspe 
we follow the criteria under fin r in determining whether we should consolidate such entities 
a determination of whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity is initially made at the time we become involved with the entity 
in those instances where we are the primary beneficiary  the assets and liabilities of the vie are consolidated on our balance sheets 
certain reconsideration events may occur which cause us to re assess our initial determination of whether an entity is a vie or non vie 
if the entity becomes a vie  we perform an assessment of consolidation of that entity 
those reconsideration events generally are the entity s governance structure is changed such that either the characteristics or adequacy of equity at risk are changed  or expected returns or losses are reallocated among the participating parties within the entity  the equity investment or some part thereof is returned to the equity investors and other interests become exposed to expected returns or losses  additional activities are undertaken or assets acquired by the entity that were beyond those anticipated previously  participants in the entity acquire or sell interests in the entity  and the entity receives additional equity at risk or curtails its activities in a way that changes the expected returns or losses 
mortgage insurance nims we provide credit enhancement on nims bonds 
a nims bond represents the securitization of a portion of the excess cash flow and prepayment penalties from a mortgage backed security comprised mostly of subprime mortgages 
the majority of this excess cash flow consists of the spread between the interest rate on the mortgage backed security and the interest generated from the underlying mortgage collateral 
historically  issuers of mortgage backed securities would have earned this excess interest over time as the collateral aged  but market efficiencies enabled these issuers to sell a portion of their residual interests to investors in the form of nims bonds 
typically  the issuer retained a significant portion of the residual interests  which are subordinated to the nims bond in a first loss position  so that the issuer would suffer losses associated with any shortfalls in residual cash flows before the nims bond experienced any losses 
nims bonds have largely been susceptible to the disruption in the housing market and the subprime mortgage market during and see overview of business results mortgage insurance discontinued non traditional products nims for information regarding our total loss expectations with respect to nims 
our nims are generally structured as qspes 
there are certain circumstances and triggers outside of our control  however  which would give us the ability to call some or all of the outstanding nims bonds 
the effective control that we attain if the call option is triggered  renders the qspe a vie under fin r 
we then assess whether we are required to consolidate the vie 
at december   there were such transactions that required consolidation in our financial statements 
the consolidated nims vie debt is recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents the following is a summary of our exposure to the nims underlying trust assets both consolidated and off balance sheet nims trusts at december  and december  december  december  in millions vie assets total nims trust assets maximum principal exposure average rating of collateral at inception total nims trust assets maximum principal exposure average rating of collateral at inception nims bbb to bb bbb to bb smart home in  we developed a program referred to as smart home  for reinsuring risk associated with non prime mortgages and riskier products 
these reinsurance transactions  through the use of spe structures  effectively transfer risk from our portfolio to investors in the capital markets 
since august  we have completed four smart home reinsurance transactions 
details of these transactions aggregated as of the initial closing of each transaction and as of december  are as follows initial as of december  pool of mortgages par value billion billion risk in force par value billion billion notes sold to investors risk ceded principal amount million million each transaction began with the formation of an unaffiliated  offshore reinsurance company 
we then entered into an agreement with the smart home reinsurer to cede to the reinsurer a portion of the risk and premium associated with a portfolio of loans 
each class relates to the loss coverage levels on the reinsured portfolio and is assigned a rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies 
we do not hold any of the credit linked notes issued as part of this structure  and therefore  we have no significant variable interests in the structures  which are not subject to consolidation under fin r 
see overview of business results mortgage insurance traditional mortgage insurance above for further discussion 
financial guaranty financial guaranty contracts written with spes may be written directly with the spe or indirectly through a cds done with a primary financial guarantor who issues a financial guaranty to the beneficial interest holders in the spe 
these spes are commonly used in cdo transactions where portfolio managers are permitted to buy and sell assets 
as a guarantor of beneficial interests held by third party investors we have been involved with spes in our financial guaranty business 
the guarantees are generally financial guarantees of principal and interest payments to beneficial interest holders 
our guarantees are generally issued on highly rated senior securities issued by these spes and are not designed to absorb a significant portion of the expected losses or expected returns of the spes 
accordingly  we do not consolidate these spes 
an increase in losses within the spe structure is not an event that would require us to reconsider consolidation under fin r 
however  if any of the trigger events discussed above were to occur and we were required to reconsider our variable interests in the spe  there is an increased risk that we may be required to consolidate some of these spes 
this is primarily due to the deterioration in subordination of the underlying collateral that has occurred since our initial determination  made at inception of the vies  that we were not the primary beneficiary 

table of contents the following table sets forth our total assets and maximum exposure to loss associated with significant financial guaranty variable interests in vies as of december for the years indicated total assets maximum exposure total assets maximum exposure in millions cdo abs other structured finance total investments we group assets in our investment portfolio into one of three main categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
fixed maturity securities for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
investments classified as trading securities and derivatives are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of income 
effective january   we began classifying convertible securities including the fixed maturity component of securities previously classified as available for sale and the derivative component previously classified as available for sale and trading securities as hybrid securities 
hybrid securities generally combine both debt and equity characteristics 
prior to  the changes in fair value of the fixed maturity component of these securities were recorded in our consolidated statements of changes in common stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and the changes in fair value of the derivative component of these securities were recorded as a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas no 
 effective january   all changes in the fair value of the entire convertible security are now recorded as net gains or losses on other financial instruments in our consolidated statements of operations 
our transition adjustment related to the adoption of sfas no 
increased retained earnings at january  by million  and reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by the same amount 
the transition amount includes unrealized gains of million net of tax and unrealized losses of million net of tax related to convertible securities at december  for securities in our investment portfolio  we conduct a quarterly evaluation of declines in market value of the securities to determine whether the decline is other than temporary 
if a security s fair value is below the cost basis  and it is judged to be an other than temporary decline  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value through earnings as a realized loss and the fair value becomes the new basis for the security 
during  we recorded approximately million of charges related to declines in the fair value of securities primarily municipal and taxable bonds  and preferred stocks considered to be other than temporary 
during and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of charges related to declines in the fair value of securities considered to be other than temporary 
other invested assets consist of million of alternative investments that are primarily private equity investments  including an investment in a fund sponsored and co managed by c bass that invests in real estate related securities 
during  we recorded a million loss considered to be other than temporary on our investment in this fund 
other invested assets are carried under the cost method or under the equity method and are evaluated for other than temporary impairment 

table of contents our evaluation of market declines for other than temporary impairment is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
we consider a wide range of factors about the security and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by management in its impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the full recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost  vii unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on asset backed securities  and viii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies

most securities with exposures to certain sectors  particularly those insured by monoline insurers  experienced credit spread widening during and we do not own any securities with underlying non investment grade ratings that are insured by monoline insurance companies

radian group s principal liquidity demands over the next months include funds for i the payment of dividends on our common stock  ii the payment of certain corporate expenses which are fully reimbursed through expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  iii interest payments on our outstanding long term debt and borrowings under our credit facility which are fully reimbursed through expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  iv payments to our insurance subsidiaries under our tax sharing agreement  and v potential capital support for our insurance subsidiaries 
radian group held directly or through an unregulated direct subsidiary  unrestricted cash and marketable securities of approximately million at december  dividends 
in july  we reduced our quarterly common stock dividend from per share to per share 
assuming that our common stock outstanding remains constant at  shares at december   we would require approximately million to pay our quarterly dividends for the next months 
corporate expenses and interest expense 
radian group has expense sharing arrangements in place with its principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their share of holding company level expenses  including interest expense on long term debt and other borrowings 
for  payments of such corporate expenses  other than interest payments  are expected to be approximately million  which is expected to be fully reimbursed by our subsidiaries 
for the same period  payments of interest on our long term debt and under our credit facility are expected to be approximately million  which also is expected to be fully reimbursed by our subsidiaries 
these expense sharing arrangements  as amended  have been approved by applicable state insurance departments  but such approval may be changed at any time 
further  any changes to these expense sharing arrangements must be approved by the administrative agent to our credit facility 
tax payments 
under our current tax sharing agreement between radian group and our subsidiaries  our subsidiaries are required to pay to radian group  on a quarterly basis  amounts representing their estimated separate company tax liability for the current tax year 
radian group is required to refund to each subsidiary any amount that such subsidiary overpaid to radian group for a taxable year as well as any amount that the subsidiary could utilize through existing carryback provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  had such subsidiary filed its federal tax return on a separate company basis 
we currently believe that radian group will be required to pay approximately million to our subsidiaries by october  including approximately million to radian guaranty 
in addition  based on our current tax loss projections  we believe that radian group will be required to pay an additional amount of approximately million to radian guaranty in october  which amount could increase up to a maximum of million if actual tax 
table of contents losses are worse than projected 
all amounts required to be paid under our tax sharing agreement are dependent on the extent of tax losses in current and future periods 
a portion of these payments may be funded from refunds that radian group receives from the internal revenue service irs 
we currently anticipate receiving a million refund from the irs in or relating to the carryback of our net operating loss 
our tax sharing agreement may not be changed without the pre approval of the applicable state insurance departments for certain of the insurance subsidiaries that are party to the agreement 
during the current period  certain of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries other than radian guaranty each incurred estimated net operating losses on a tax basis that  if computed on a separate company return basis  could not be utilized through existing carryback provisions of the code 
as a result  we are not currently obligated to reimburse them for their respective unutilized tax losses 
however  if in a future period  any of these subsidiaries generate taxable income such that they are able to realize their individual net operating loss carryforward under the code  then we will be obligated under the tax sharing agreement to fund such subsidiary s share of the net operating loss that has been utilized on a consolidated group tax return basis 
each of these subsidiaries has incurred significant losses in the recent past and is expected to incur additional losses in the future as a result of their insured portfolios of mortgage collateral  and most of them are not currently originating new business 
capital support for subsidiaries 
radian group could be required to provide additional capital support for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries if required by insurance regulators  the gses or the rating agencies 
in light of on going losses in our mortgage insurance business  we anticipate that radian group may be required to provide capital support to commonwealth mortgage assurance company of texas cmac of texas  an indirect insurance subsidiary of radian group that provides reinsurance to radian guaranty 
recently  radian group contributed million to cmac of texas 
dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and sherman  and permitted payments to radian group under tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  are radian group s principal sources of cash 
our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to radian group is subject to various conditions imposed by the gses and rating agencies  and by insurance regulations requiring insurance department approval 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
in light of on going losses in our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  we do not anticipate that these subsidiaries will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to issue dividends to radian group for the foreseeable future 
to the extent radian asset assurance is permitted to issue dividends  these dividends will be issued to radian guaranty  the direct parent company of radian asset assurance  and not to radian group 
dividends from sherman are not subject to regulatory conditions  but to the extent received  must be used to pay down outstanding amounts under our credit facility if such amounts exceed our tax obligations resulting from our equity ownership of sherman 
sherman paid million of dividends to radian group during the year ended december   compared to million of dividends during the year ended december  in january  sherman paid dividends to radian group in the amount of million 
we expect to fund all of radian group s short term liquidity needs with existing cash and marketable securities  cash received under the tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries and cash dividends from sherman 
if the cash radian group receives from its tax and expense sharing arrangements and or sherman is insufficient for radian group to fund its obligations  radian group may be required to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt  by issuing additional equity or by selling assets  including our interest in sherman  which we may not be able to do on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  we are required to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility with any amounts we raise through the issuance of securities eg  debt  equity or hybrid securities or the sale of certain of our assets  including sherman 
if required  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital 
in  we amended our credit facility  reducing the principal amount outstanding from million to million 
we are not currently permitted to borrow under the facility until the outstanding principal amount is reduced 
see contractual obligations and commitments above 

table of contents radian group long term liquidity needs our most significant need for liquidity beyond the next months is the repayment of the principal amount of our outstanding long term debt and other borrowings and the potential payment of up to million to radian guaranty in october under our tax sharing arrangement as discussed above 
approximately million in principal amount of our long term debt and million of principal borrowings under our credit facility are due in we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs through available cash  the private or public issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets 
the current downturn in the credit markets has created a situation where we would likely not be able to refinance our long term debt on favorable terms  if at all  if it were due currently 
we expect that market conditions will improve by  but cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to access the capital markets on favorable terms  if at all  prior to our long term debt becoming due 
see risk factors we have significant payment obligations upcoming in and mortgage insurance the principal liquidity and capital demands of our mortgage insurance business include the payment of operating expenses  including those allocated from radian group  claim payments and taxes 
the principal sources of liquidity in our mortgage insurance business are written premiums  net investment income and cash dividends from radian asset assurance and potential payments from radian group under our tax allocation agreements 
our mortgage insurance business incurred significant losses during and due to the current housing and related credit market downturn 
we believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with a portion of the funds necessary to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses during and in the next few years 
if operating cash flows are not sufficient to fund claim payments and operating expenses  we believe that any shortfall can be funded from sales of short term marketable securities held by our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and from maturing fixed income investments 
in the event that we are unable to fund excess claim payments and operating expenses through the sale of short term marketable securities and from maturing fixed income investments  we may be required to incur unanticipated capital losses or delays in connection with the sale of less liquid marketable securities held by our mortgage insurance business 
in light of the expected future losses by radian guaranty  we determined it was necessary to provide additional capital to radian guaranty in order to maintain adequate risk to capital ratios  leverage ratios and surplus requirements and to protect its insurance financial strength ratings 
in addition to protecting its financial strength ratings  additional capital is an important component of our plan to improve our ratings with s p and moody s over a time period that is acceptable to us  as well as being important to the gses and our lender counterparties 
during the second quarter of  radian asset assurance declared an ordinary dividend of million to radian group 
in addition  radian group contributed its equity interest in radian asset assurance to radian guaranty in the third quarter of this restructuring provided significant regulatory capital credit to radian guaranty and is intended to provide cash dividends to radian guaranty over time 
as of december   our financial guaranty business maintained claims paying resources of billion  including a statutory surplus of million 
assuming there is no material deterioration in the credit performance of our financial guaranty business  we expect radian asset assurance to issue significant cash dividends to radian guaranty over time as our existing financial guaranty portfolio matures and the exposure is reduced 
based on our current projected statutory net income and policyholders surplus  we currently expect radian asset assurance to pay an ordinary dividend of approximately million to radian guaranty during the timing and amount of future cash infusions will depend on the dividend capacity of radian asset assurance  which is governed by new york insurance laws 
if the exposure is reduced on an accelerated basis through the recapture of business from the primary customers in our financial guaranty reinsurance business or otherwise  we may have the ability to release capital to our mortgage insurance business more quickly and in a greater amount 
however  if the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio deteriorates materially  we would likely have less capacity to issue dividends to our mortgage insurance business  and we could be restricted from issuing dividends altogether 
see risk factors the long term capital adequacy of radian guaranty is dependent  in part  upon the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio 

table of contents financial guaranty the principal liquidity demands of our financial guaranty business include the payment of operating expenses  including those allocated from radian group  claim payments  taxes and dividends to radian guaranty 
the principal sources of liquidity in our financial guaranty business are written premiums and net investment income 
we believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our financial guaranty subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with the funds necessary to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses for at least the next months 
we believe that we have the ability to fund any operating cash flow shortfall from sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio maintained at our operating companies and from maturing fixed income investments 
in the event that we are unable to fund excess claim payments and operating expenses through the sale of these marketable securities and from maturing fixed income investments  we may be required to incur unanticipated capital losses or delays in connection with the sale of less liquid marketable securities held by our financial guaranty business

critical accounting policies sec guidance defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized available information including our historical experience  industry standards and the current economic and housing environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below 
reserve for losses we establish reserves to provide for losses and the estimated costs of settling claims in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments 
setting loss reserves in both businesses involves significant use of estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
in our mortgage insurance segment  reserves for losses are not generally established until we are notified that a borrower has missed two consecutive payments 
we also establish reserves for associated lae  consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process  including legal and other fees and expenses associated with administering the claims process 
we follow the accounting guidance in sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas no 
relating to the reserve for losses on our mortgage insurance contracts excluding financial guaranty contracts 
we maintain an extensive database of claim payment history and use models  based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by its servicer  and macroeconomic factors such as regional economic conditions that involve significant variability over time  as well as more static factors such as the estimated foreclosure period in the area where the default exists  to help determine the likelihood that a default will result in a claim referred to as the default to claim rate  the amount that we will pay if a default becomes a claim referred to as claim severity and based on these estimates  the appropriate loss reserve at any point in time 
the default and claim cycle in our mortgage insurance business begins with our receipt of a default notice from the insured lender 
a default is defined under our master policy as a borrower s failure to make a payment equal to or greater than one monthly regular payment under a loan 
generally  our master policy of insurance requires the insured to notify us of a default within days of the loan s having been in default for three months or the occurrence of an early default in which the borrower fails to make any of the initial monthly payments under a loan so that an amount equal to two monthly payments has not been paid 
for reporting and internal tracking purposes  we do not consider a loan to be in default until the loan has been in default for days 
with respect to delinquent loans that are in an early stage of delinquency  considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels 
adjustments in estimates for delinquent loans in the early stage of delinquency are more volatile in nature than for loans that are in the later stage of delinquency  which generally 
table of contents require a larger reserve 
as the delinquency proceeds toward foreclosure  there is more certainty around these estimates as a result of the aged status of the delinquent loan  and adjustments are made to loss reserves to reflect this updated information 
if a default cures  historically  a large percentage of defaulted loans have cured before going to claim  although this rate has decreased significantly in the current deteriorating housing environment the reserve for that loan is removed from the reserve for losses and lae 
this curing process causes an appearance of a reduction in reserves from prior years if the reduction in reserves from cures is greater than the additional reserves for those loans that are nearing foreclosure or have become claims 
in the mortgage insurance segment  we also establish reserves for defaults that we believe to have occurred but that have not been reported to us on a timely basis by lending institutions 
all estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are made as they become necessary 
we generally do not establish reserves for loans that are in default if we believe that we will not be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default 
for example  for those defaults in which we are in a second loss position  we calculate what the reserve would have been if there had been no deductible 
if the existing deductible is greater than the reserve amount for any given default  we do not establish a reserve for the default 
we generally do not establish loss reserves for expected future claims on insured mortgages that are not in default or believed to be in default 
see reserve for premium deficiency below for an exception to this general principle 
each loan that we insure is identified by product type ie  prime  subprime  alt a and type of insurance ie primary or pool at the time the loan is initially insured 
different product types typically exhibit different loss behavior 
accordingly  our reserve model applies different ultimate default to claim rates and severities to each product type  taking into account the different loss development patterns and borrower behavior that are inherent in these products  as well as whether we are in a first or second loss position and whether there are deductibles on the insured loans 
we use an actuarial projection methodology called a roll rate analysis to determine the projected ultimate default to claim rates for each product and to produce a reserve point for each product 
as discussed above  the roll rate analysis uses claim payment history for each product to help determine the likelihood that a default will result in a claim and the amount that we will pay if a default becomes a claim 
therefore  the key assumption affecting our methodology is that future ultimate default to claim rates and severities will be consistent with our recent experience 
the following table shows the mortgage insurance range of loss and lae reserves  and recorded reserves for losses and lae  as of december  and december  as of december  as of december  loss and lae reserves in millions low high recorded low high recorded mortgage insurance operations reserves for our mortgage insurance business are recorded based on our modeled output for loss and lae reserves 
in light of the regular adjustments made to the underlying assumptions in our model as discussed above  we believe the amount generated by our model at december  best represents the most accurate estimate of our future losses and lae 
we believe the high and low amounts highlighted in the table above represent a reasonable estimate of the range of possible outcomes around our recorded reserve point for the period indicated 
we considered the sensitivity on first lien loss reserve estimates at december   by assessing the potential changes resulting from a parallel shift in severity and default to claim rate 
for example  assuming all other factors remain constant  for every one percentage point change in claim severity at december   we estimated that our loss reserves would change by approximately million at december  for every one percentage point change in our default to claim rate at december   we estimated a million change in our loss reserves at december  
table of contents the following table shows the breakdown of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses for our financial guaranty segment at the end of each period indicated december in thousands financial guaranty allocated reserves unallocated non specific trade credit reinsurance and other case reserves incurred but not reported ibnr total setting reserves requires us to exercise judgment in estimating the severity of the claim that is likely to result from an identified reserving event  which may be any amount up to the full amount of the insured obligation 
the reliability of this estimate depends on the reliability of the information regarding the likely severity of the claim and the judgments made by management with respect to that information 
even when we are aware of the occurrence of an event that requires the establishment of a reserve  our estimate of the severity of the claim that is likely to result from that event may not ultimately be correct 
in the financial guaranty segment  we establish loss reserves on our non derivative financial guaranty contracts 
we establish case and lae reserves for specifically identified impaired credits that have defaulted and allocated non specific and lae reserves for specific credits that we expect to default case reserves and allocated non specific reserves combined represent our allocated reserves 
in addition  we may establish only an lae reserve where appropriate for specific credits that we do not expect to default 
in the case of directly insured financial guaranty contracts  we determine the existence of payment default and record case reserves when we determine that a default has occurred  based on a report from the insured party or based on our surveillance efforts 
for assumed financial guaranty reinsurance contracts  we rely mostly on information provided by the primary insurer as confirmed by us  as well as specific knowledge of the claim  in recording related case reserves 
in addition  we record allocated non specific reserves for losses when we identify through our surveillance procedures or  for assumed reinsurance contracts  after we confirm information provided by the primary insurer regarding specific significant deterioration events that have occurred  with respect to specific insured credits that have not yet defaulted 
allocated non specific reserves include contracts currently classified as intensified surveillance and special mention 
in addition  because we believe that inherent deterioration begins immediately and continues over time on our remaining portfolio  we also record unallocated non specific reserves for other losses  on a portfolio basis 
as discussed below  the reserving policies used by the financial guaranty industry will be impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for financial guarantee insurance contracts  an interpretation of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
sfas no 

our unallocated non specific reserves are established over time by applying an expected loss ratio to the premiums earned during each reporting period and discretionary adjustments by management as appropriate due to changes in expected frequency and severity of losses 
the expected lifetime losses for each credit are determined by multiplying the expected frequency of losses on that credit by the expected severity of losses on that credit and multiplying this number  the loss factor  by that credit s outstanding par amount 
the expected frequency and severity of losses for each credit is generated from three sources two that are published by major rating agencies and one that is generated by a proprietary internal model based on the product class  published rating and term to maturity for each credit 
we set the expected lifetime losses for each credit at a point in the range between the highest and lowest expected lifetime loss factors generated by the rating agency and internally generated models 
the loss ratio on an insured credit tends to be very low because we mostly insure investment grade obligations that  historically  have a very low probability of default 
although the default rate is low  the severity can be very high because we typically insure large financial obligations 
because of the low incidence of losses on financial guaranty obligations  it is also very difficult to estimate the timing of losses on 
table of contents our insured obligations for which we have not yet established a specific reserve 
our unallocated non specific loss reserve at december   was million 
the range between the unallocated non specific reserves that would have resulted from applying the highest and lowest loss ratios generated by any of the three models was approximately million to million  which we believe provides a reasonably likely range of expected losses 
at each balance sheet date  we also evaluate both the model generated loss ratios and our unallocated non specific reserves against management s subjective view of qualitative factors to ensure that the loss ratios and the unallocated non specific reserves represent management s best estimate of the expected losses on our portfolio of credits for which we have not established an unallocated or allocated non specific reserve 
these qualitative factors include existing economic and business conditions  overall credit quality trends resulting from industry  geographic  economic and political conditions  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  changes in underwriting policies and procedures and seasoning of the book of business 
the macroeconomic factors that we evaluate are outside of our control and are subject to considerable variability 
the company specific factors that we evaluate also require us to make subjective judgments 
in addition  a significant change in the size of our portfolio underlying the unallocated non specific reserves  such as through the expiration of policies or the refunding or recapture of insured exposures  could require an adjustment to the loss ratios or our level of unallocated non specific reserves 
our estimates of our reserves for losses and lae for our financial guaranty segment s other lines of business  mainly trade credit reinsurance  depend upon the receipt of accurate information on claims and loss estimates from ceding companies 
in addition  a reserve is included for losses and lae ibnr on trade credit reinsurance 
we use historical loss information and make inquiries to the cedants of known events as a means of validating our loss assumptions 
setting the loss reserves in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty business segments involves significant reliance upon estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
the models and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate  especially during an extended economic downturn 
we cannot be certain that we have correctly estimated the necessary amount of reserves or that the reserves established will be adequate to cover ultimate losses on incurred defaults 
reserve for premium deficiency sfas no 
requires a premium deficiency reserve if the net present value of the expected future losses and expenses for a particular product exceeds the net present value for expected future premiums and existing reserves for that product 
we reassess our expectations for premiums  losses and expenses for each of our businesses at least quarterly and update our premium deficiency analysis accordingly 
for purposes of premium deficiency analysis  we group our mortgage insurance products into two categories  first lien and second lien 
in  we established a reserve for premium deficiency on our second lien mortgage insurance business 
to calculate the premium deficiency  we project future premiums and losses for our second lien business on a transaction by transaction basis  using historical results to help determine future performance for both repayments and claims 
an estimated expense factor is then applied  and the result is discounted using a rate of return that approximates our investment yield 
this net present value  less any existing reserves  is recorded as a premium deficiency and the reserve is updated on a periodic basis based on actual results for that quarter  along with updated transaction level projections 
during  the second lien premium deficiency reserve decreased by approximately million to million 
in january  we settled on certain second lien mortgage insurance transactions  which reduced our risk in force by approximately million to approximately million 
the settlement amount was million less than our december  reserve amount  and as a result  we reduced our second lien premium deficiency reserve through the provision for premium deficiency by million at december  the net present value of expected losses and expenses on our second lien business at december  was million  offset by the net present value of expected premiums of 
table of contents million and already established reserves of million 
our second lien portfolio is relatively seasoned  and as a result we do not believe that changes in macro economic factors will result in significant changes to our current loss projections 
in june  we established a reserve for premium deficiency on our domestic first lien mortgage insurance business 
at december   our current mortgage insurance portfolio is expected to generate a cumulative net profit and  therefore  no premium deficiency reserve was determined to exist as of that date 
the net present value of expected losses and expenses on our first lien business at december  was billion  offset by the net present value of expected premiums of billion and already established reserves net of reinsurance recoverables of billion 
expected losses include an assumed paid claim rate of approximately on our total primary first lien mortgage insurance portfolio  including on prime  on subprime and on alt a 
while deterioration in the macroeconomic environment has resulted in an increase in expected losses  new business originated during the second half of is expected to be profitable  which has contributed to the overall expected net profitability of the portfolio 
numerous factors affect our ultimate paid claim rates  including home price depreciation  unemployment  loan claim rescission and interest rates  as well as potential benefits associated with recently announced lender and governmental initiatives to modify loans and ultimately reduce foreclosures 
to assess the need for a premium deficiency reserve on our first lien mortgage insurance portfolio  we develop loss projections based on modeled loan defaults in our current risk in force 
this projection is based on recent trends in default experience  severity  and roll rates of delinquent loans to claim  as well as recent trends in prepayment speeds 
as of december   our modeled loan default projections assume that recent observed increases in defaults will continue into mid  remain stable at this increased level through the end of  and gradually return to normal historic levels over the subsequent two years 
if our modeled loan default projections were stressed such that recent observed increases in defaults were to continue until mid  remain stable through the end of  and gradually return to normal historic levels over the subsequent three years  we would require a premium deficiency reserve of billion for our first lien portfolio as of december  derivative instruments and hedging activity we account for derivatives under sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted 
in general  sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values and changes in fair value recorded in net income unless the derivatives qualify as hedges 
if the derivatives qualify as hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
as of december   we have no derivative contracts that qualify as hedges 
all our derivative instruments are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities  depending on the rights or obligations under the contracts 
our credit protection in the form of credit default swaps  certain financial guaranty contracts within both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments  nims and put options on cps do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
 so changes in their fair value are included in current earnings in our consolidated statements of operations 
net unrealized gains and losses on credit default swaps and certain other derivative contracts are included in either derivative assets or derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents a summary of our derivative assets and liabilities  as of and for the periods indicated  is as follows balance sheets december december in millions derivative assets financial guaranty credit derivative assets nims assets put options on cps mortgage insurance international cds assets total derivative assets derivative liabilities financial guaranty credit derivative liabilities nims liabilities mortgage insurance domestic and international cds liabilities total derivative liabilities total derivative liabilities  net money market committed preferred custodial trust securities cps

certain contracts are in an asset position because the net present value of the contractual premium exceeds the net present value of the fair premium 
the notional value of our derivative contracts at december  and december  was billion and billion  respectively 
the application of sfas no 
 as amended  results in volatility from period to period in gains and losses as reported on our consolidated statements of operations 
generally  these gains and losses result mostly from changes in corporate credit or asset backed spreads and changes in the creditworthiness of underlying corporate entities or the credit performance of the assets underlying an asset backed security 
beginning in  as required by the provision of sfas no 
 we also incorporated factors to include our own non performance risk in our assessment of fair value 
any incurred gains or losses on such contracts are recognized as a change in fair value of derivative instruments 
we record premiums and origination costs related to credit default swaps and certain other derivative contracts in change in fair value of derivative instruments and policy acquisition costs  respectively  on our consolidated statements of operations 
in previously reported financial statements prior to  premiums earned on derivative contracts were included in premiums earned on our consolidated statements of operations

sfas no

there was no cumulative impact on retained earnings as a result of the adoption 
in accordance with fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
 we have elected to defer the effective date of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities until january  
table of contents we define fair value as the current amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability  other than in a forced liquidation 
sfas no 
requires that a fair value measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available 
assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model 
in the event that our investments or derivative contracts were sold or transferred in a forced liquidation  the fair values received or paid may be materially different than those determined in accordance with sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when valuing fair value measurements in a liability position we are required to incorporate into the fair value an adjustment that reflects our own non performance risk 
as our credit default swap spread widens  the fair value of our liabilities decreases 
as required by sfas no 
 we established a fair value hierarchy by prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level i measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level iii measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas no 
are described below level i unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level ii quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  level iii prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
the level of market activity in determining the fair value hierarchy is based on the availability of observable inputs market participants would use to price an asset or a liability  including market value price observations 
for markets in which inputs are not observable or limited  we use significant judgment and assumptions that a typical market participant would use to evaluate the market price of an asset or liability 
these assets and liabilities are classified in level iii of our fair value hierarchy 
a financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
at december   our total level iii assets approximated of total assets measured at fair value and total level iii liabilities accounted for of total liabilities measured at fair value 
the following are descriptions of our valuation methodologies for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
investments us government and agency securities the fair value of us government and agency securities is estimated using observed market transactions  including broker dealer quotes and actual trade activity 
as such  u 
s government and agency securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
municipal and state securities the fair value of municipal and state securities is estimated using recently executed transactions  market price quotations and pricing models that factor in  where applicable  interest rate yield curves and credit spreads for similar bonds 
these securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
money market instruments the fair value of money market instruments is based on daily prices which are published and available to all potential investors and market participants 
as such  these securities are categorized in level i of the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents corporate bonds the fair value of corporate bonds is estimated using recently executed transactions and market price observations 
in addition  a spread model is used to incorporate early redemption features  when applicable 
these securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when significant unobservable inputs are used 
asset backed securities abs  commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos the fair values of abs  cmbs and cmos are estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads  and observable prepayment speeds 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
foreign government securities the fair value of foreign government securities is estimated using observed market yields used to create a maturity curve and observed credit spreads from market makers and broker dealers 
these securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
hybrid securities these instruments are convertible securities measured at fair value based on observed trading activity and daily quotes 
in addition  on a daily basis  dealer quotes are marked against the current price of the corresponding underlying stock 
these securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
for certain securities  the underlying security price may be adjusted to account for observable changes in the conversion and investment value from the time the quote was obtained 
such securities are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
equity securities the fair value of these securities is generally estimated using observable market data in active markets or bid prices from market makers and broker dealers 
generally  these securities are categorized in level i or ii of the fair value hierarchy as observable market data is available on these securities 
securities that are not frequently traded or are not as liquid are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
other investments the fair value of these securities is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
these securities are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
derivative assets and liabilities fair value is defined as the price that would be received in connection with the sale of an asset or that would be paid to transfer a liability 
in determining an exit market in accordance with sfas no  we consider the fact that most of our derivative contracts are unconditional and irrevocable  and contractually prohibit us from transferring them to other capital market participants 
accordingly  there is no principal market for such highly structured insured credit derivatives 
in the absence of a principal market  we value these insured credit derivatives in a hypothetical market where market participants include other monoline mortgage and financial guaranty insurers with similar credit quality to us  as if the risk of loss on these contracts could be transferred to these other mortgage and financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance companies 
we believe that in the absence of a principal market  this hypothetical market provides the most relevant information with respect to fair value estimates 
we determine the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities using internally generated models 
we utilize market observable inputs  such as credit spreads on similar products  whenever they are available and relevant 
because we do not expect to pay claims for most of our contracts  we believe this credit spread approach provides us with the best estimate of fair value for these contracts 
when a contract experiences significant credit deterioration  and we can estimate expected losses  we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate fair value 
in these instances  we believe a discounted cash flow analysis results in a more accurate estimate of fair value  as it considers reasonably estimable losses associated with the specific contract and  therefore  is more relevant than using a market based index or credit spread 
there is a high degree of uncertainty about our fair value estimates since our contracts are not traded or exchanged  which makes external validation and corroboration of our estimates difficult  particularly given the current market environment  where very few  if any  contracts are being traded or originated 
in very limited recent instances  we have negotiated terminations of financial guaranty contracts with our counterparties and believe that such terminations provide the most relevant data with respect to validating our fair value estimates and such data has been generally consistent with our fair value estimates 

table of contents beginning in  in accordance with sfas no 
 we made an adjustment to our derivative liabilities valuation methodology to account for our own non performance risk by incorporating our observable credit default swap spread into the determination of the fair value of our credit derivatives 
our five year credit default swap spread widened by  basis points during and considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates may not be indicative of amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
put options on cps the fair value of our put options on cps is estimated based on the present value of the spread differential between the current market rate of issuing a perpetual preferred security and the maximum contractual rate of our perpetual preferred security as specified in our put option agreements 
in determining the current market rate  consideration is given to our current cds spread as well as market observations of similar securities issued  when available 
the spread differential is typically assumed to be fixed in perpetuity and the annual cost differential is discounted at our current cds spread  adjusted for a market implied recovery rate 
at december   given the current market environment and the market s view of our credit risk  we determined that there were no market observations of relevance  and that there is currently no liquidity for these securities 
therefore  based on our assessment that the perpetual preferred securities could not be issued currently at any interest rate  we determined that the current market value of the options is equal to the issuance amount  which is million 
until the market changes such that there is some liquidity for our perpetual preferred securities  the fair value of these put options is not expected to be sensitive to changes in interest rates or in our cds spread 
the put options on cps are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
nims credit derivatives and nims derivative assets nims credit derivatives are financial guarantees that we have issued on nims 
nims derivative assets primarily represent derivative assets in the nims trusts that we are required to consolidate in accordance with fin r 
the estimated fair value of these financial instruments are derived from internally generated discounted cash flow models 
we estimate losses in each securitization underlying either the nims credit derivatives or the nims derivative assets by applying expected default rates separately to loans that are delinquent and those that are paying currently 
these default rates are based on historical experience of similar transactions 
we then project prepayment speeds on the underlying collateral in each securitization  incorporating historical prepayment experience 
the estimated loss and prepayment speeds are used to estimate the cash flows for each underlying securitization and nims bond  and ultimately  to produce the projected credit losses for each nims bond 
in addition to expected credit losses  we consider the future expected premiums to be received from the nims trust for each credit derivative 
the projected net losses are then discounted using a rate of return that incorporates our own non performance risk  and based on our current credit default swap spread  results in a significant reduction of the derivative liability 
because nims guarantees are not market traded instruments  considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value 
the use of different assumptions and or methodologies could have a significant effect on estimated fair values 
the nims credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
as a result of our having to consolidate several nims structures  the derivative assets held by the nims vie are also fair valued using the same internally generated valuation model 
the nims vie derivative assets are also categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
changes in our expected principal credit losses on nims could have a significant impact on our fair value estimate 
the gross expected principal credit losses were million as of december   which is our best estimate of settlement value and represents of our total risk in force of million 
the fair value of our total net liabilities related to nims as of december  was million  of which million relates to derivative assets  million relates to derivative liabilities and million relates to consolidated debt of the nims vie trusts that we consolidate 
our fair value estimate incorporates a discount 
table of contents rate that is based on our credit default swap spread  which has resulted in a fair value amount that is substantially less than the expected settlement value 
changes in the credit loss estimates will impact the fair value directly  reduced only by the present value factor  which is dependent on the timing of the expected losses and our credit spread 
corporate cdos the fair value of each of our corporate cdo transactions is estimated based on the difference between the present value of the expected future contractual premiums we charge and the fair premium amount that we estimate that another financial guarantor would require to assume the rights and obligations under our contracts 
the fair value estimates reflect the fair value of the asset or liability  which is consistent with the in exchange approach  in which fair value is determined based on the price that would be received or paid in a current transaction as defined by sfas no 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
present value of expected future contractual premiums our contractual premiums are subject to change for two reasons all of our contracts provide our counterparties with the right to terminate upon our default and of our corporate cdo transactions as of december  provide our counterparties with the right to terminate these transactions based on certain rating agency downgrades that have occurred as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in determining the expected future premiums of these transactions  we adjust the contractual premiums for such transactions to reflect the estimated fair value of those premiums  based on our estimate of the probability of our counterparties exercising this downgrade termination right and the impact it would have on the remaining expected lifetime premium 
the discount rate we use to determine the present value of expected future premiums is our credit default swap spread plus a risk free rate 
this discount rate reflects the risk that we may not collect future premiums due to our inability to satisfy our contractual obligations  which provides our counterparties the right to terminate the contracts 
for each corporate cdo transaction  we perform three principal steps in determining the fair premium amount first  we define a tranche on the cdx index defined below that equates to the risk profile of our specific transaction we refer to this tranche as an equivalent risk tranche  second  we determine the fair premium amount on the equivalent risk tranche for those market participants engaged in trading on the cdx index we refer to each of these participants as a typical market participant  and third  we adjust the fair premium amount for a typical market participant to account for the difference between the non performance or default risk of a typical market participant and the non performance or default risk of a financial guarantor of similar credit quality to us in each case  we refer to the risk of non performance as non performance risk 
defining the equivalent risk tranche direct observations of fair premium amounts for our transactions are not available since these transactions cannot be traded or transferred pursuant to their terms and there is currently no active market for these transactions 
however  credit default swaps on tranches of a standardized index the cdx index are widely traded and observable  and provide relevant market data for determining the fair premium amount of our transactions  as described more fully below 
the cdx index is a synthetic corporate cdo that is comprised of a list of corporate obligors and is segmented into multiple tranches of synthetic senior unsecured debt of these obligors ranging from the equity tranche ie  the most credit risk or first loss position to the most senior tranche ie  the least credit risk 
we refer to each of these tranches as a standard cdx tranche 
a tranche is defined by an attachment point and detachment point  representing the range of portfolio losses for which the protection seller would be required to make a payment 

table of contents our corporate cdo transactions possess similar structural features to the standard cdx tranches  but often differ with respect to certain of the referenced corporate entities  term  attachment point and detachment points 
therefore  in order to determine the equivalent risk tranche for each of our corporate cdo transactions  we determine the attachment and detachment points on the cdx index that have comparable estimated probabilities of loss as the attachment and detachment points in our transactions 
we begin by performing a simulation analysis of referenced entity defaults in our transactions to determine the probability of portfolio losses exceeding our attachment and detachment points 
the referenced entity defaults are primarily determined based on the following inputs the market observed credit default swap credit spreads of the referenced corporate entities  the correlations between each of the referenced corporate entities  and the term of the transaction 
for each referenced corporate entity in our corporate cdo transactions  the credit default swap spreads associated with the term of our transactions credit curve define the estimated expected loss for each entity as applied in a market standard approach known as risk neutral modeling 
the credit curves on individual referenced entities are generally observable 
the expected cumulative loss for the portfolio of referenced entities associated with each of our transactions is the sum of the expected losses of these individual referenced entities 
with respect to the correlation of losses across the underlying reference entities  two obligors belonging to the same industry or located in the same geographical region are assumed to have a higher probability of defaulting together ie  they are more correlated 
an increase in the correlations between the referenced entities generally causes a higher expected loss for the portfolio associated with our transactions 
the estimated correlation factors that we use are derived internally based on observable third party inputs that are based on historical data 
the impact of our correlation assumptions currently does not have a material effect on our fair premium estimates in light of the significant impact of our non performance risk adjustment as described below 
once we have established the probability of portfolio losses exceeding the attachment and detachment points in our transactions  we then use the same simulation method to locate the attachment and detachment points on the cdx index with comparable probabilities 
these equivalent attachment and detachment points define the equivalent risk tranche on the cdx index that we use to determine fair premium amounts 
determining the typical fair premium amount the equivalent risk tranches for our corporate cdo transactions often are not identical to any standard cdx tranches 
as a result  fair premium amounts generally are not directly observable from the cdx index for the equivalent risk tranche and must be separately determined 
we make this determination through an interpolation in which we use the observed premium rates on the standard cdx tranches that most closely match our equivalent risk tranche to derive the typical fair premium amount for the equivalent risk tranche 
non performance risk adjustment on corporate cdos the typical fair premium amount estimated for the equivalent risk tranche represents the fair premium amount for a typical market participant not radian 
accordingly  the final step in our fair value estimation is to convert this typical fair premium amount into a fair premium amount for a financial guarantor of similar credit quality to us 
a typical market participant is contractually bound by a requirement that collateral be posted regularly to minimize the impact of that participant s default or non performance 
this collateral posting feature makes these transactions less risky to the protection buyer  and therefore  priced differently 
none of our contracts require us to post collateral with our counterparties  which exposes our counterparties fully to our non performance risk 
we make an adjustment to the typical fair premium amount to account for both this contractual difference  as well as for the market s perception of our default probability which is observable through our credit default swap spread 
the amount of the non performance risk adjustment is computed based  in part  on the expected claim payment by radian 
to estimate this expected payment  we first determine the expected claim payment of a typical market participant by using a risk neutral modeling approach 
a significant underlying assumption of the risk neutral model approach that we use is that the typical fair premium amount is equal to the present value of expected claim payments from a typical market participant 
expected claim payments on a transaction are based on the expected loss on that transaction also determined using the risk neutral modeling approach 
radian s 
table of contents expected claim payment is calculated based on the correlation between the default probability of the transaction and our default probability 
the default probability of radian is determined from the observed radian group credit default swap spread  and the default probability of the transaction is determined as described above under defining the equivalent risk tranche 
the present value of radian s expected claim payments is discounted using a risk free interest rate  as the expected claim payments have already been risk adjusted 
the reduction in our fair premium amount related to our non performance risk is limited to a minimum fair premium amount  which is determined based on our estimate of the minimum fair premium that a market participant would require to assume the risks of our obligations 
our non performance risk adjustment currently results in a material reduction of our typical fair premium amounts 
non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions our non corporate cdo transactions include our guaranty of rmbs cdos  cmbs cdos  trust preferred securities trups cdos and cdos backed by other asset classes such as i municipal securities  ii synthetic financial guarantees of asset backed securities such as auto loan and credit card securities and iii project finance transactions 
the fair value of our non corporate cdo and other derivative transactions is calculated as the difference between the present value of the expected future contractual premiums and our estimate of the fair premium amount for these transactions 
the present value of expected future contractual premiums is determined based on the methodology described above for corporate cdos 
for our credit card and auto loan transactions  the fair premium amount is estimated using observed spreads on recent trades of securities that are similar to the securities that we guaranty 
in all other instances  we utilize internal models to estimate the fair premium amount as described below 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
rmbs cdos the fair value amounts for our two remaining rmbs cdo transactions are derived using standard market indices and discounted cash flows  to the extent expected losses are estimable 
the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligations in one of these transactions is reasonably similar to that which is included in the aaa rated abx 
he index  a standardized list of residential mortgage backed security reference obligations 
accordingly  the fair premium amount for a typical market participant for this transaction is derived directly from the observed spreads of this index 
for our second rmbs cdo transaction  the underlying referenced obligations in this transaction have experienced significant credit deterioration  and we expect this deterioration ultimately will result in claims 
fair value for this transaction is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
we estimate projected claims based on our internal credit analysis which is based on the current performance of each underlying reference obligation  and our estimate of the claim rate associated with the current delinquent loans 
the expected cash flows from the underlying reference obligations are then present valued using a discount rate derived from the bbb abx 
he index 
the insured cash flows are present valued using a discount rate that is equal to our credit default swap rate plus a risk free rate 
cmbs cdos the fair premium amounts for our cmbs cdo transactions for a typical market participant are derived directly from the observed spreads on the cmbx indices 
the cmbx indices represent standardized lists of commercial mortgage backed security reference obligations 
a different cmbx index exists for different types of underlying referenced obligations based on their various origination periods and credit grades 
for each of our cmbs cdo transactions we use the cmbx index that most directly correlates to our transaction with respect to the origination period and credit rating of the referenced obligations included in our transactions 
the typical fair premium amount is the expected future fair premiums determined by the observed index spreads present valued using a discount rate equal to the credit default swap spread of a typical market participant plus a risk free rate 
trups cdos our trups transactions are synthetic cdos where the underlying referenced obligations are preferred securities of financial institutions consisting primarily of banks and insurance companies whose individual spreads are not observable 
in each case  we provide credit protection on a specific tranche of each synthetic cdo 
in determining estimated fair values of our trups cdo transactions  we use internally generated models to calculate the fair premium amount for a typical market participant based on the following inputs our contractual premium rate which is estimated to be equal to the typical fair premium rate as of the contract date  the estimated 
table of contents change in the spread of the underlying referenced obligations  the remaining term of the trups cdos and the deterioration if any of the subordination 
we start with our contractual premium rate and then make an adjustment for the estimated change in the spread of the underlying referenced obligations from inception of the transaction to the current measurement date  as the fundamental underlying relationship between the contractual premium rate and the underlying default risk that existed at the transaction date is assumed to be the primary driver of the fair premium 
to determine the spread of the underlying reference obligations  which are not observable  we assume these spreads to be proportional to the weighted average credit default swap spread of a group of investment grade and high yield institutions whose market risk is determined by us to be similar to the specific financial institutions underlying our trups 
the relationship between the spread on these referenced obligations and the typical fair premium rate on the tranche we insure is then determined based on the historical observed relationship between the spread on the referenced entities of the cdx index and the typical fair premium rate on a senior tranche of the cdx index  because the direct relationship for trups cdos is not observable 
a separate adjustment to the fair premium rate is then calculated for each transaction based on its remaining average life 
this adjustment accounts for changes in the remaining average life of our transactions and is based on historically observed typical fair premium rates for corporate obligations with similar remaining maturities 
a separate adjustment to the typical fair premium rate is then calculated for each transaction based on any deterioration of subordination that has occurred since origination 
this adjustment is based on a relationship between subordination and typical fair premium rate for a cdo transaction according to a simulation model 
this adjustment is not currently significant to our overall fair value estimate given the significant remaining subordination underlying our deals 
the typical fair premium amount is the expected future fair premiums present valued using a discount rate equal to the credit default swap spread of a typical market participant plus a risk free rate 
all other non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions for all of our other non corporate cdo and other derivative transactions observed prices and market indices are not available 
as a result  we utilize an internal model that estimates fair premium based on a market rate of return that would be required for a monoline insurer to undertake the contract risk 
the fair premium amount is calculated as the premium required to achieve a market rate of return net of expected losses and other expenses over an estimated internally developed risk based capital amount 
such market rates of return approximate historical rates of return earned by financial guarantors 
expected losses and our internally developed risk based capital amounts are projected by our model based on the internal credit rating  term  asset class  and current par outstanding for each transaction 
for each of the non corporate cdo and other derivative transactions discussed above  with the exception of the rmbs cdo transaction that is valued using a discounted cash flow analysis  we make an adjustment to the fair premium amounts as described above under non performance risk adjustments on corporate cdos to incorporate our own non performance risk 
the non performance risk adjustment associated with our rmbs cdo is incorporated in the fair value as described above  therefore no separate adjustment is required 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
assumed financial guaranty credit derivatives in making our own determination of fair value for these credit derivatives  we use information provided to us by our counterparties to these reinsurance transactions  which are the primary insurers the primaries of the underlying credits  including the primaries fair valuations for these credits 
the estimated fair value of pooled corporate cdo cds contracts is based on the primaries pricing models that use the dow jones cdx for domestic corporate cds contracts and itraxx for european corporate cds contracts 
each index provides price quotes for standard attachment and detachment points for contracts with maturities of three  five  seven and ten years 
the quoted index price is calibrated by the primaries to the typical attachment points for that type of cds contract in order to derive the appropriate value 
the value of cds and collateralized loan obligations clo contracts is estimated with reference to the libor spread in the current published jp morgan high yield clo triple a index  which includes a credit and funding component 
in addition  these fair value estimates incorporate an adjustment for our non performance risk that is based on our credit default swap spread 
the primaries models used to estimate the fair values of these instruments include a number of factors  including credit spreads  changes in interest rates  changes in correlation assumptions  current delinquencies  recovery rates 
table of contents and the credit ratings of referenced entities 
in establishing our fair value marks for these transactions  we assess the reasonableness of the primaries valuations by reviewing the primaries publicly available information regarding their mark to market processes  including methodology and key assumptions  and discussing the changes in fair value with the primaries where the changes appear unusual or do not appear materially consistent with credit loss related information when provided by the primaries for these transactions 
despite significant volatility in relevant credit spreads during each of the four quarters ended december   in each of these quarters the change in fair value of our assumed financial guaranty credit derivatives represented less than of our net gains or losses on all credit derivatives 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
mortgage insurance domestic and international cds in determining the estimated fair value of our mortgage insurance domestic cds  we use internal models that employ a discounted cash flow methodology 
we estimate losses in each securitization by applying expected default rates separately to loans that are delinquent and to those that are current 
we then project prepayment speeds on the underlying collateral in each securitization  incorporating historical prepayment experience 
the estimated loss and prepayment speeds are used to estimate the cash flows for each underlying securitization  and ultimately  to produce the projected credit losses for each mortgage insurance domestic cds 
in addition to expected credit losses  the fair value for each mortgage insurance domestic cds is approximated by incorporating future expected premiums to be received from the transaction 
these future expected premiums are discounted utilizing a risk adjusted interest rate that is based on the current rating of each transaction 
the projected net losses are discounted using a rate of return that incorporates our own non performance risk  which currently results in a significant reduction of the derivative liability 
the use of different assumptions and or methodologies could have a significant effect on estimated fair values 
changes in our expected credit losses on mortgage insurance domestic cds could have a significant impact on our fair value estimate for this product  with a maximum principal loss exposure of million and expected losses as of december  in the amount of million 
changes in the loss estimates will impact the fair value directly  reduced only by the discount factor  which is dependent on the timing of the expected losses 
however  in light of our comparatively small amount of notional exposure on mortgage insurance domestic cds  we do not expect changes in the fair value of this product to materially impact the overall fair value of our credit derivatives 
the mortgage insurance domestic cds are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
in determining the estimated fair value of our mortgage insurance international cds  we use the following information non binding fair value quotes from our counterparties on each respective deal  which are based on quotes for transactions with similar underlying collateral from market makers and other broker dealers  and in the absence of observable market data for these transactions  a review of monthly information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral and discussion with our counterparties regarding any unusual or inconsistent changes in fair value 
in either case  in the event there are material inconsistencies in the inputs to determine estimated fair value  they are reviewed and a final determination is made by management in light of the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each price 
despite significant volatility in credit spreads during each of the four quarters ended december   in each of these quarters  the change in fair value of our mortgage insurance international cds represented less than of our net gains or losses on all credit derivatives 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
for each of the mortgage insurance international cds transactions  we make an adjustment to the fair value amounts described above to incorporate our own non performance risk 
the amount of the adjustment is computed based on the correlation between the default probability of the transaction and our default probability as described more fully under non performance risk adjustments on corporate cdos 

table of contents the following table quantifies the impact of our non performance risk on our derivative assets and derivative liabilities in aggregate by type presented in our consolidated balance sheets 
the five year cds spread is presented as an illustration of the market s view of our non performance risk  the cds spread used in the valuation of specific derivatives is typically based on the remaining term of the instrument 
january january december radian group five year credit default swap spread in basis points product in millions impact of initial adoption at january  unrealized gain cumulative unrealized gain at december  corporate cdos non corporate cdos nims and other total the unrealized gain attributable to the market s perception of our non performance risk increased significantly during as presented in the table above 
this increase was driven by two separate factors 
first  our credit default swap spread widened significantly during the first six months of the year  and when combined with the effect of the implementation of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  had the effect of reducing our fair premium amounts on our derivative contracts to very low absolute levels 
second  the market spreads on the cdx index that we utilize to determine fair premium amounts prior to our non performance risk adjustment widened from approximately basis points at january  to basis points at december  because our credit default swap spread is very high  our fair premium amounts have remained low regardless of the changes in the cdx index 
because both cdx index spreads and our credit default swap spreads widened significantly during the year  this resulted in a significant increase in our non performance risk adjustment

deferred policy acquisition costs costs associated with the acquisition of mortgage insurance business  consisting of compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses  are initially deferred and reported as deferred policy acquisition costs 
amortization of these costs for each underwriting year is charged against revenue in proportion to estimated gross profits over the estimated life of the policies 
this includes accruing interest on the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition costs 
estimates of expected gross profit are based on persistency and loss development assumptions for each underwriting year used as a basis for amortization are evaluated at least quarterly  and the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted by a charge or credit to our consolidated statements of operations if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
considerable judgment is used in evaluating these factors when updating the assumptions 
the use of different assumptions could have a significant effect on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs in the financial guaranty business are comprised of those expenses that vary with  and are principally related to  the production of insurance premiums  including commissions paid on reinsurance assumed  salaries and related costs of underwriting and marketing personnel  rating agency fees  premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses  offset by commission income on premiums ceded to reinsurers 
acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned for each underwriting year 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is adjusted regularly based on the expected timing of both upfront and installment based premiums 
the estimation of installment based premiums requires considerable judgment  and different assumptions could produce different results

applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts  including the recognition and measurement to be used to account for premium revenue and claim liabilities 
the scope of sfas no 
is limited to financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance contracts issued by insurance enterprises included within the scope of sfas no 
sfas no 
does not apply to financial guarantee insurance contracts accounted for as derivative contracts under sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and all interim periods within those fiscal years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
requires that an insurance enterprise recognize a claim liability prior to an event of default insured event when there is evidence that credit deterioration has occurred in an insured financial obligation  and when it is expected that the present value of expected claim loss will exceed the unearned premium revenue 
the expected loss is based on the probability weighted present value of expected net cash outflows to be paid under the contract 
in measuring the claim liability  we develop the present value of expected net cash outflows by using our own assumptions about the likelihood of all possible outcomes  based on information currently available 
currently  we establish unallocated non specific reserves for our entire portfolio based on estimated statistical loss probabilities 
those credits that have defaulted are identified as case reserve credits are aggregated  tracked on a list watch list  and reserves are established 
for those credits in the intensified surveillance category and where a default is considered to be likely  an allocated non specific reserve is established 
in each case  the most likely loss scenario becomes the amount reserved 
our unallocated non specific reserve will be eliminated upon the full implementation of sfas no 
in the first quarter of in addition  case reserves and allocated non specific reserves may also change upon adoption 

table of contents upon the adoption of sfas no 
 we will be required to record the initial unearned premium liability equal to the present value of the premiums due or expected to be collected over either the period of the financial guarantee insurance contract or the expected period of risk 
in determining the present value of premiums due  we will use a discount rate that reflects the risk free rate at the inception of the contract 
under sfas no 
 premiums paid in full at inception will be recorded as unearned premiums 
currently  premiums paid in advance of the coverage period are recorded as a liability for the amount received 
in addition  sfas no 
will require the recognition of the remaining unearned premium revenue on refundings for financial guaranty policies that are extinguished 
a refunding that is effected through legal defeasance does not qualify for immediate revenue recognition 
consequently  this will result in previously recognized refundings to be reversed as part of the cumulative impact

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions 
examples of market risk include changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
we perform  on an annual basis  a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects of market risk exposures on our investment securities and certain financial guaranty contracts 
this analysis is performed by determining the potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
our sensitivity analysis is generally calculated as a parallel shift in yield curve with all other factors remaining constant 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we review changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices to determine whether there has been a material change in our market risk since that presented in connection with our annual sensitivity analysis 

table of contents interest rate risk the primary market risk in our investment portfolio is interest rate risk  namely the fair value sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate risk 
as a result of the analysis  we have determined that the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investment assets is materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
we estimate the changes in fair value of our fixed income securities by projecting an instantaneous increase and decrease in interest rates 
the carrying value of our total investment portfolio at december  and december   was billion and billion  respectively  of which and at december  and december   respectively  was invested in fixed income securities 
our analysts calculate duration  expressed in years  as an estimate of interest rate sensitivity of our fixed income securities 
a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the market value of our fixed income securities by million  while a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the market value of our fixed income securities by million 
at december   the average duration of the fixed income portfolio was years 
the market value and carrying value of our long term debt at december  was million and million  respectively 
in general  the market value of our long term debt reflects market concerns regarding our ability to continue to service our debt and ultimately repay or refinance our debt as it matures 
credit spread risk we provide credit protection in the form of credit default swaps and other financial guaranty contracts that are marked to market through earnings under the requirements of sfas no 
with the exception of nims and certain domestic mortgage insurance cds  these financial guaranty derivative contracts generally insure obligations with considerable subordination beneath our exposure at the time of issuance 
the underlying asset classes of these obligations include corporate  asset backed  residential mortgage backed and commercial mortgage backed securities 
with the exception of nims  one rmbs cdo  and certain domestic mortgage insurance cds contracts for which deterioration in value is primarily attributed to future expected credit losses  the value of our financial guaranty derivative contracts were affected predominantly by changes in credit spreads of the underlying obligations collateral  in some cases compounded by ratings downgrades of insured obligations 
as credit spreads and ratings change  the values of these financial guaranty derivative contracts will change and the resulting gains and losses will be recorded in our operating results 
in addition  with the adoption of sfas no 
 we have incorporated the market s perception of our non performance risk into the market value of our derivative assets and liabilities 
sensitivity to changes in credit spreads can be estimated by projecting a hypothetical instantaneous shift in credit spread curves 
the following table presents the pre tax change in fair value of our derivatives portfolio as a result of instantaneous shifts in credit spreads as of december   assuming that our own credit default swap spread remained constant 
these changes were calculated using the valuation methods described in critical accounting policies fair value of financial instruments above 
contracts for which the fair value is calculated using specific dealer quotes or actual transaction prices are excluded from the following table as we are unable to obtain data necessary to model hypothetical changes in these contracts

given the relatively high level of volatility in spreads underlying our collateral including our own credit default swap spread during  the sensitivities presented above are higher than our longer term historical experience  where spread volatilities rarely exceeded basis points before the range of  basis point tightening and  basis point widening was determined to a significant degree based on our most recent experience  which we believe is reasonably likely to continue in the current market environment despite historic levels that were much more stable 
foreign exchange rate risk one means of assessing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments is to model effects on reported earnings using a sensitivity analysis 
we analyzed our currency exposure as of december  by identifying investments in our investment portfolio that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as part of our analysis  our investment portfolio foreign currency exposures were re measured  generally assuming a decrease in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated that such a decrease would reduce our investment portfolio held in foreign currencies by million as of december  at december   we held approximately million of investments denominated in euros 
the value of the euro against the us dollar weakened from at december  to at december  at december   we held approximately million of investments denominated in japanese yen 
the value of the yen against the us dollar strengthened from at december  compared to at december  equity market price at december   the market value and cost of our equity securities were million and million  respectively 
included in the market value and cost of our equity securities is million and million  respectively  related to trading securities 
exposure to changes in equity market prices can be estimated by assessing potential changes in market values on our equity investments resulting from a hypothetical broad based decline in equity market prices of 
with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated that such a decrease would reduce our investment portfolio held in equity investments by million as of december  there have been no material changes in our equity market price risk during
