credit risk credit risk is the risk that we will not receive all contractual amounts due on investments that we have purchased as a result of a default by the borrower or guarantor and the resulting deficiency in proceeds from the liquidation of the collateral securing the obligation 
all of our investments have credit risk in varying degrees 
some of our investments including agency mbs and certain securitized mortgage loans include guaranty of payment from third parties 
for example  our agency mbs have credit risk to the extent that fannie mae or freddie mac fail to remit payments on these mbs for which they have issued a guaranty of payment 
in addition  certain of our securitized mortgage loans have pool guarantees where certain parties provide guarantees of repayment on pools of loans up to a limited amount 
the following table presents information at december  with respect to our investments and the amounts guaranteed  if applicable 
investment amounts in thousands amortized cost basis amount of guaranty guarantor average credit rating of guarantor with guaranty of payment agency mbs fannie mae freddie mac aaa securitized mortgage loans commercial american international group a single family pmi gemico b baa defeased loans fully secured with cash without guaranty of payment securitized mortgage loans commercial single family investment in joint venture other investments allowance for loan losses total investments reflects lowest rating of the three nationally recognized ratings agencies for the senior unsecured debt of the guarantor 
aside from guaranty of payment  for our securitized mortgage loans  we have limited our credit risk through the securitization process and the issuance of securitization financing 
the securitization process limits our credit risk from an economic point of view as the securitization financing is recourse only to the assets pledged 
therefore  from an economic point of view  our risk is limited to the difference between the amount of securitized mortgage loans pledged and the amount of securitization financing outstanding 
this difference is referred to as overcollateralization 
we have also attempted to minimize our credit risk through the prudent underwriting of loans at their origination  the seasoning of the loans and the close monitoring of the performance of the servicer of the loan 
where we have retained credit risk  we provide an allowance for loan loss 
the following table presents information for securitized mortgage loans at december  investment amounts in thousands amortized cost basis of loans average seasoning in years current loan to value based on original appraised value amortized cost basis of delinquent loans delinquency commercial mortgage loans single family mortgage loans loans contractually delinquent by or more days 
of the  of delinquent single family loans  approximately  are pool insured and  of the remaining   of the loans made a payment within the days prior to december  loans secured by low income multifamily housing tax credit lihtc properties account for of our securitized commercial loan portfolio 
lihtc properties are properties eligible for tax credits under section of the internal revenue code the code 
section of the code provides tax credits to investors in projects to construct or substantially rehabilitate properties that provide housing for qualifying low income families for as much as of the eligible cost basis of the property 
failure by the borrower to comply with certain income and rental restrictions required by section or  more importantly  a default on a loan financing a section property during the section prescribed tax compliance period generally years from the date the property is placed in service can result in the recapture of previously used tax credits from the borrower 
the potential cost of tax credit recapture provides an incentive to the property owner to support the property during the compliance period 
the following table shows the weighted average remaining compliance period of our portfolio of lihtc commercial loans at december  as a percent of the total lihtc commercial loan portfolio 
months remaining to end of compliance period as a percent of unpaid principal balance compliance period already exceeded up to one year remaining between one and three years remaining between four and six years remaining total there were two delinquent lihtc commercial mortgage loans with a total unpaid principal balance of million at december  there were no delinquent lihtc commercial mortgage loans at december  interest rate risk as discussed in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we invest in agency mbs and securitized mortgage loans on a leveraged basis 
at any given time  these investments may consist of hybrid agency arms which have a fixed rate of interest for an initial period  and agency arms or adjustable rate loans which generally have interest rates which reset annually based on a spread to an index such as libor  and which are subject to interim and lifetime interest rate caps 
of our agency arms and adjustable rate loans  approximately of these loans reset based upon the level of six month libor  reset based on the level of one year libor and reset based on the level of one year cmt 
the interest rate caps could limit the amount that the interest rate may reset 
generally the borrowings used to finance these assets will have interest rates resetting every to days and they will not have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
periodic caps ranges from annually  and lifetime caps are generally 
in addition  certain of our securitized mortgage loans have a fixed rate of interest and are financed with borrowings with interest rates that adjust monthly 
during a period of rising short term interest rates  the rates on our borrowings will reset higher on a more frequent basis than the interest rates on our investments  decreasing our net interest income earned and the corresponding cash flow on our investments 
conversely  net interest income may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the adjustable rate loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements  to the extent that we have entered into such agreements 
at december   the interest rates on our investments and the associated borrowings  if any  on these investments will prospectively reset based on the following time frames not considering the impact of prepayments investments borrowings amounts in thousands amounts percent amounts percent fixed rate investments obligations adjustable rate investments obligations less than months greater than months and less than year greater than year and less than years greater than years and less than years greater than years and less than years total the investment amount represents the fair value of the related securities and amortized cost basis of the related loans  excluding any related allowance for loan losses

adjustable rate mortgage loans collateralize our hybrid agency and agency arm mbs portfolio 
the interest rates on the adjustable rate mortgage loans are typically fixed for a predetermined period and then adjust annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index 
the following tables present information about the lifetime and interim interest rate caps on our hybrid agency mbs portfolio as of december  lifetime interest rate caps on arm mbs interim interest rate caps on arm mbs of total of total to to to interest rate caps impact a security s yield and its to reset to market rates 
in an effort to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the mismatch in the timing of the interest rate resets in our investments versus our borrowings  we may enter into derivative transactions  in the form of forward purchase commitments and interest rate swaps  which are intended to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increases on our repurchase agreements  which rates are typically libor based 
swaps generally result in interest savings in a rising interest rate environment  while in a declining interest rate environment generally result in our paying the stated fixed rate on the notional amount for each of the swap transactions  which could be higher than the market rate 
we take into account both anticipated coupon resets and expected prepayments when measuring the sensitivity of our agency mbs investments to changes in interest rates 
in measuring our repricing gap ie  the weighted average time period until our agency mbs are expected to prepay or reprice less the weighted average time period for liabilities to reprice or repricing gap  we measure the difference between a the weighted average months until the next coupon adjustment or projected prepayment on the agency mbs investments  and b the months remaining until our repurchase agreements mature  applying the same projected prepayment rate and including the impact of derivative transactions  if any 
a constant prepayment rate or cpr is applied in order to reflect  to a certain extent  the prepayment characteristics inherent in our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table presents information at december  about our repricing gap based on contractual maturities ie  cpr  and applying a cpr  cpr and cpr

tabular presentation we monitor the aggregate cash flow  projected net interest income and estimated market value of our investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
the information presented in the table below projects the impact of sudden changes in interest rates on our annual projected net interest income and projected portfolio value  as more fully discussed below  based on our investments at december   and includes all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  except for equity securities with a carrying value of million 
we had no hedges at december  changes in projected net interest income equals the change that would occur in the calculated net interest income for the next twenty four months relative to the change scenario if interest rates were to instantaneously parallel shift to and remain at the stated level for the next twenty four months 
changes in projected market value equals the change in value of our assets that we carry at fair value rather than at historical amortized cost and any change in the value of any derivative instruments or hedges  such as interest rate swap agreements  in the event of an interest rate shift as described above 
we acquire interest rate sensitive assets and fund them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we generally plan to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
the analysis below is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates beyond the forward libor curve  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of our assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results 
in addition  certain investments which we own provide a degree of optionality 
the most significant option affecting the portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each collateral pool in the investment portfolio 
the model applies the same prepayment rate assumptions for all five cases indicated below for all investments owned by us except for agency mbs 
for agency mbs  prepayment rates are adjusted based on modeled and management estimates for each of the rate scenarios set forth below 
the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  the projected results assume no additions or subtractions to our portfolio  and no change to our liability structure 
historically  there have been significant changes in our investment portfolio and the liabilities incurred by us in response to interest rate movement  as such changes are a tool by which we can mitigate interest rate risk in response to changed conditions 
as a result of anticipated prepayments on assets in the investment portfolio  there are likely to be such changes in the future 
the table below represents immediate changes  or shocks  to the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  at that date  one month libor was and six month libor was 
the interest rate environment at december  reflected elevated short term libor rates given the conditions that existed in the credit markets at that time 
modeled libor rates used to determine the base case ranged from a low of to a high of during the modeled period 
basis point change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected market value general many assumptions are made to present the information in the above table and  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur  or that other events will not occur  that would affect the outcomes  therefore  the above tables and all related disclosures constitute forward looking statements 
the analyses presented utilize assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions and restructuring could materially change the interest rate risk profile for us 
the tables quantify the potential changes in net income and net asset value should interest rates be shocked 
the results of interest rate shocks of plus and minus and basis points are presented 
the cash flows associated with the portfolio of mortgage related assets for each rate shock are calculated based on a variety of assumptions including prepayment speeds  time until coupon reset  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates no negative rates are utilized  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement and amount of borrowing 
assumptions made in calculating the impact on net asset value of interest rate shocks include interest rates  prepayment rates and the yield spread of mortgage related assets relative to prevailing interest rates purchase premiums and discounts are amortized based on the constant effective yield calculated at the purchase date 
therefore  on a tax basis  amortization of premiums and discounts will differ from those reported for financial purposes under gaap 
at december   the net premium on our investment securities portfolio for financial accounting purposes was million of the principal balance of our investment securities  and the net discount on our securitization financing for financial accounting purposes was million of the principal balance of our investments 
in general  we believe that we will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields  however  no assurances can be given that  should significant prepayments occur  market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds timely reinvested
