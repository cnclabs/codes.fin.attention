second  the company concentrates on building a more robust  further reaching distribution channel 
third  as the company s customers expand in international markets  par has been creating an international infrastructure  initially focusing on the asia pacific rim due to the new restaurant growth and concentration of par s customers in that region

summary the company believes it is and can continue to be successful in its two core business segments hospitality and government due to its capabilities and industry expertise 
the majority of the company s business is in the quick serve restaurant sector of the hospitality market 
in regards to the current economic landscape  par believes that this sector will remain strong during this period of uncertainty 
this is a direct reflection of the value and convenience par s large quick service customers can and do provide 
the smaller sectors of the company s hospitality segment are its hotel  resort and spa customers as well as its distribution channel which targets smaller independent restaurants 
these sectors are being impacted by the current economic uncertainty and  as a result  are experiencing a smaller rate of growth than the company s quick service restaurant sector 
it has been the company s experience that their government i t business is resistant to economic cycles including reductions in the federal defense budgets 
clearly par s i t outsourcing business focuses on cost effective operations of technology and telecommunication facilities which must function independent of economic cycles 
additionally  it is the company s experience that its government research and development spending has only fluctuated modestly during times of military cutbacks

this agreement expires in june at december   there was  outstanding under this agreement 
the weighted average interest rate paid by the company was during this agreement contains certain loan covenants including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the company is in compliance with these covenants at december  this credit facility is secured by certain assets of the company 
in  the company borrowed  under an unsecured term loan agreement  executed as an amendment to one of its then bank line of credit agreements  in connection with the asset acquisition of siva corporation 
the loan provides for interest only payments in the first year and escalating principal payments through the loan bears interest at the libor rate plus the applicable interest rate spread or at the bank s prime lending rate plus the applicable interest rate spread at december  
the terms and conditions of the line of credit agreement described in the preceding paragraph also apply to the term loan 
in september  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement associated with the above  loan  with principal and interest payments due through august at december   the notional principal amount totaled  this instrument was utilized by the company to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
the company did not adopt hedge accounting under the provision of fasb statement no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  but rather records the fair market value adjustments through the consolidated statements of operations each period

the company has a  mortgage collateralized by certain real estate 
the annual mortgage payment including interest totals  the mortgage bears interest at a fixed rate of and matures in the company also leases office space in several locations for varying terms

the company does not usually enter into long term contracts with its major hospitality segment customers 
the company commits to purchasing inventory from its suppliers based on a combination of internal forecasts and the actual orders from customers 
this process  along with good relations with suppliers  minimizes the working capital investment required by the company 
although the company lists two major customers  mcdonald s and yum brands  it sells to hundreds of individual franchisees of these corporations  each of which is individually responsible for its own debts 
these broadly made sales substantially reduce the impact on the company s liquidity if one individual franchisee reduces the volume of its purchases from the company in a given year 
the company  based on internal forecasts  believes its existing cash  line of credit facilities and its anticipated operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  the company may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors including its rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of its products 
the company cannot assure that additional equity or debt financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the company s sources of liquidity beyond twelve months  in management s opinion  will be its cash balances on hand at that time  funds provided by operations  funds available through its lines of credit and the long term credit facilities that it can arrange 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and adequacy on a consistent basis throughout the company 
primary areas where financial information of the company is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment include revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  and taxes 
revenue recognition policy the company recognizes revenue generated by the hospitality segment using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and the aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
product revenues consist of sales of the company s standard point of sale and property management systems of the hospitality segment 
product revenues include both hardware and software sales 
the company also records service revenues relating to its standard point of sale and property management systems of the hospitality segment 
hardware revenue recognition on hardware sales occurs upon delivery to the customer site or when shipped for systems that are not installed by the company as under sab no 
 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
software revenue recognition on software sales generally occurs upon delivery to the customer site or when shipped for systems that are not installed by the company as under sop  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for software sales where the company is the sole party that has the proprietary knowledge to install the software  revenue is recognized upon installation and when the system is ready to go live 
service service revenue consists of installation and training services  support maintenance  and field and depot repair 
installation and training service revenue are based upon standard hourly daily rates and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
support maintenance and field and depot repair are provided to customers either on a time and materials basis or under a maintenance contract 
services provided on a time and materials basis are recognized as the services are performed 
service revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the underlying contract period 
the individual product and service offerings that are included in arrangements with our customers are identified and priced separately to the customer based upon the stand alone price for each individual product or service sold in the arrangement irrespective of the combination of products and services which are included in a particular arrangement 
as such  the units of accounting are based on each individual product and service sold  and revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value for each individual product and service is based on separate individual prices of these products and services 
the sales price used to establish fair value is the sales price of the element when it is sold individually in a separate arrangement and not as a separate element in a multiple element arrangement 
contracts the company recognizes revenue in its government segment using the guidance from sec sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the company s contract revenues generated by the government segment result primarily from contract services performed for the us government under a variety of cost plus fixed fee  time and material  and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized based on allowable costs for labor hours delivered  as well as other allowable costs plus the applicable fee 
revenue on time and material contracts is recognized by multiplying the number of direct labor hours delivered in the performance of the contract by the contract billing rates and adding other direct costs as incurred 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized as labor hours are delivered which approximates the straight line basis of the life of the contract 
the company s obligation under these contracts is to provide labor hours to conduct research or to staff facilities with no other deliverables or performance obligations 
anticipated losses on all contracts are recorded in full when identified 
unbilled accounts receivable are stated in the company s consolidated financial statements at their estimated realizable value 
contract costs  including indirect expenses  are subject to audit and adjustment through negotiations between the company and us government representatives 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of probable losses related to accounts receivable balances 
the establishment of allowances requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding probable losses on receivable balances 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
thus  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
inventories the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company uses certain estimates and judgments and considers several factors including product demand and changes in technology to provide for excess and obsolescence reserves to properly value inventory 
capitalized software development costs the company capitalizes certain costs related to the development of computer software used in its hospitality segment under the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software development costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are charged to operations and included in research and development costs 
software development costs incurred after establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated economic life when the product is available for general release to customers 
goodwill the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
the company operates in two core business segments  hospitality and government 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the sub segment level referred to as a reporting unit 
the three reporting units utilized by the company are restaurant  hotel spa  and government 
goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units  it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition  and all of the activities within a reporting unit  whether acquired or organically grown  are available to support the value of the goodwill 
pursuant to fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  involves comparing each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  there is an indication of impairment at which time a second step would be performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment 
the company utilizes three methodologies in performing their goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit 
these methodologies include both an income approach  namely a discounted cash flow method  and two market approaches  namely the guideline public company method and quoted price method 
the discounted cash flow method was weighted in the fair value calculation  while the public company method and quoted price method were weighted each of the fair value calculation 
the discounted cash flow method derives a value by determining the present value of a projected level of income stream  including a terminal value 
this method involves the present value of a series of estimated future benefits at the valuation date by the application of a discount rate  one which a prudent investor would require before making an investment in the equity of the company 
the company considered this method to be most reflective of a market participant s view of fair value given the current market conditions as it is based on the company s forecasted results and  therefore  established its weighting at of the fair value calculation 
key assumptions within the company s discounted cash flow model include financial projections  long term growth rate ranging from to depending on the reporting unit  and a discount rate of 
as stated above  as this method derives value from the present value of a projected level of income stream  a modification to the projected operating results could impact the fair value 
a change to the long term growth rate could impact the fair value 
the present value of the cash flows is determined using a discount rate that was based on the capital structure and capital costs of comparable public companies as identified by the company 
a change to the discount rate could impact the fair value determination 
the market approach is a general way of determining a value indication of a business  business ownership interest  security or intangible asset by using one or more methods that compare the subject to similar businesses  business ownership interests  securities or intangible assets that have been sold 
there are two methodologies considered under the market approach the public company method and the quoted price method 
the public company method and quoted price methods of appraisal are based on the premise that pricing multiples of publicly traded companies can be used as a tool to be applied in valuing closely held companies 
the mechanics of the method require the use of the stock price in conjunction with other factors to create a pricing multiple that can be used  with certain adjustments  to apply against the subject s similar factor to determine an estimate of value for the subject company 
the company considered these methods appropriate as they provide an indication of fair value as supported by current market conditions 
the company established its weighting at of the fair value calculation for each method 
the most critical assumption underlying the market approaches utilized by the company are the comparable companies utilized 
each market approach described above estimates revenue and earnings multiples for the company based on its comparables 
as such  a change to the comparable companies could have an impact on the fair value determination 
the valuation methodologies used in the current year are substantially the same as those used in the prior year with the exception of the utilization of the quoted price method in fiscal and concurrent elimination of the merger and acquisition method  which was used in fiscal as part of the company s determination of appropriate valuation methods to be used  the company concluded that there was not sufficient data including current and relevant transactions to appropriately serve as a basis for utilizing the merger and acquisition method 
however  the company determined it prudent to continue to utilize a market approach as part of their valuation and therefore selected the quoted price method as the more appropriate method to replace the merger and acquisition method 
the weightings applied to each method are unchanged from those utilized in fiscal year except that of the fair value calculation was applied to the quoted price method in fiscal and no value was derived from the merger and acquisition method 
although the company s market capitalization was less than its book value at december  indicating a potential devaluation of the company s assets  the company has determined that no triggering event occurred as of december  after considering the following factors o although in general the economy was experiencing a downturn  the primary markets in which the company does business did not appear to be experiencing a downturn commensurate with the overall economy o the company s operating results have improved throughout o actual operating performance of its major customers  as well as the business outlook that such customers were providing to their investors  o current overall order volume was in excess of order volume over the same period of the previous fiscal quarter  o the company has been involved in negotiations with new customers relative to potential hardware upgrades to a large number of their restaurants  the company has qualitatively reconciled the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the consolidated company including a traditional control premium 
the economic conditions in late and early and the volatility in the financial markets in late and early  both in the us and in many other countries where the company operates  have contributed and may continue to contribute to higher unemployment levels  decreased consumer spending  reduced credit availability and or declining business and consumer confidence 
such conditions could have an impact on the markets in which the company s customers operate  which could result in a reduction of sales  operating income and cash flows 
reductions in these results or changes in the factors described in the preceding paragraph could have a material adverse impact on the underlying estimates used in deriving the fair value of the company s reporting units used in support of its annual goodwill impairment test or could result in a triggering event requiring a fair value remeasurement 
this remeasurement may result in an impairment charge in future periods 
taxes the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s estimates of its future taxable income levels
