company overview union drilling  inc provides contract land drilling services and equipment  primarily to natural gas producers in the united states 
in addition to our drilling rigs  we provide the drilling crews and most of the ancillary equipment needed to operate our drilling rigs 
we commenced operations in with drilling rigs and related equipment acquired from an entity providing contract drilling services under the name union drilling 
through a combination of acquisitions and new rig construction  we have increased the size of our fleet to marketed land drilling rigs 
we presently focus our operations in selected natural gas production regions in the united states  primarily the fort worth basin in north texas  the arkoma basin in oklahoma and arkansas and throughout the appalachian basin 
we do not invest in oil and natural gas properties 
we completed several transactions from through which increased the size of our rig fleet  thus enhancing our ability to serve our customers 
two acquisitions in provided us with unconventional natural gas contract drilling operations in north texas and the arkoma basin 
we subsequently purchased additional rigs  including newly constructed rigs  and have devoted significant capital expenditures to upgrade other rigs in our fleet for underbalanced and horizontal drilling 
at various times  we remove rigs from our marketed fleet  and the components are made available for use on other rigs 
these investments positioned our fleet to capitalize on our customers unconventional formation exploration and development activity 
key indicators of financial performance for management significant performance measurements in our industry are rig utilization  revenue per revenue day and operating expenses per revenue day 
revenue days for each rig are days when the rig is earning revenues under a contract  which is usually a period from the date the rig begins moving to the drilling location until the rig is released from the contract 
we compute rig utilization rates by dividing revenue days by total available days during a period 
total available days are the number of calendar days during the period that we have owned the marketed rig 

table of contents the following table summarizes management s key indicators of financial performance for the three years ended december  years ended december  revenue days average number of marketed rigs marketed rig utilization rates revenue per revenue day operating expenses per revenue day revenue days increased slightly in compared to primarily due to four new large rigs deployed in the latter part of the third quarter of this increase in revenue days was partially offset by the continued decline in demand for smaller rigs in our fleet  resulting in the slight decrease in the marketed rig utilization rates 
utilization and revenue days during were negatively impacted by a significant decline in the demand for smaller rigs in our fleet  the transition of our rocky mountain rigs to the fayetteville shale  which was completed at the end of the second quarter of  and an increase in the number of rigs available in the market we devote substantial resources to maintaining and upgrading our rig fleet 
on a regular basis  we remove certain rigs from service to perform upgrades 
in the short term  these actions result in fewer revenue days and slightly lower utilization  however  in the long term  we believe the upgrades will help the marketability of the rigs and improve their operating performance 
we are currently performing or have recently performed  between contracts or as necessary  safety and equipment upgrades to various rigs in our fleet 
the increase in revenue per revenue day and operating expenses per revenue day in compared to was primarily related to the new rigs placed into service during the latter part of the third quarter of in addition  operating expenses per revenue day in grew more rapidly than revenue per revenue day due to higher employment costs  repairs and maintenance  fuel and supplies which we were not able to fully pass through to our customers 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to the new rigs placed into service in late through early due to their greater capacity  these new rigs earned a higher dayrate and incurred more operating expenses than older rigs in our fleet 
market conditions in our industry the us contract land drilling services industry is highly volatile 
volatility in oil and natural gas prices can produce wide swings in the levels of overall drilling activity in the markets we serve and affect the demand for our drilling services and the rates we can charge for our rigs 
the availability of financing sources  past trends in oil and natural gas prices and the outlook for future oil and natural gas prices strongly influence the number of wells exploration and production companies decide to drill 
see item business and item a 
risk factors 
during fiscal  and  substantially all the wells we drilled for our customers were drilled in search of natural gas because of the depth capacity of our rigs and the natural gas rich areas in which we operate 
our customers are primarily focused on drilling for natural gas 
natural gas reserves are typically found in deeper geological formations and generally require premium equipment and quality crews to drill the wells 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue and cost recognition 
we generate revenue principally by drilling wells for natural gas producers on a contracted basis under daywork or footage contracts  which provide for the drilling of single or multiple well projects 
revenues on daywork contracts are recognized based on the days worked at the dayrate each contract specifies 
mobilization fees are recognized as the related drilling services are provided 
we recognize revenues on footage contracts based on the footage drilled for the applicable accounting period 
expenses are recognized based on the costs incurred during that same accounting period 
accounts receivable 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers based on their financial information  if available  information obtained from major industry suppliers  and our past experiences with the customer 
in some instances  we require new customers to establish escrow accounts or make prepayments 
we typically invoice our customers periodically during the performance of daywork contracts and upon completion of the daywork contract 
footage contracts are invoiced upon completion of 
table of contents the contract 
our contracts generally provide for payment of invoices in days 
we established an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million and  at december  and  respectively 
any allowance established is subject to judgment and estimates made by management 
we determine our allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  our assessment of our customers current abilities to pay obligations to us and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
we write off specific accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
during  we wrote off million of accounts receivable  primarily for four customers  three of which subsequently declared bankruptcy 
we are pursuing our claims in the bankruptcy proceedings 
during  we wrote off million of accounts receivable  of which million was for one customer 
in addition  the reserve for sales credits was approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
at december  and  our contract drilling work in progress totaled approximately million and million  respectively  all of which relates to the revenue recognized  but not yet billed  on daywork and footage contracts in progress at december  and  respectively 
the balance at december  includes million of revenue we recognized as a result of our settlement with a customer under a drilling contract 
excluding this million settlement accrual  the decrease in our contract drilling work in progress was due primarily to an increase in progress billings 
asset impairments 
we assess the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in connection with this review  assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings 
the cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time 
management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will fluctuate 
based on management s expectations of future trends  we estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets in our assessment of impairment 
these estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future 
factors that we consider important and which could trigger an impairment review would be any significant negative trends in the industry or the general economy  our contract revenue rates  our rig utilization rates  cash flows from our drilling rigs  existence of term drilling contracts  current oil and natural gas prices  industry analysts outlook for the industry and their view of our customers access to capital and the trends in the price of used drilling equipment observed by our management 
if a review of our drilling rigs indicates that our carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we are required under applicable accounting standards to write down the drilling equipment to its fair market value 
in the fourth quarter of  oil and natural gas prices and the market capitalization of the company declined significantly 
however  our rig utilization rates and revenue trends were relatively consistent with or slightly improved over prior quarters and were improved over levels 
based on these factors  we considered whether there were indicators of impairment for certain of our property and equipment 
we estimated future cash flows over the expected life of the identified long lived assets and determined that  on an undiscounted basis  expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long lived assets 
based on this assessment  no impairment was recognized 
in the event that market conditions continue to deteriorate  the company may be required to record impairment of its property and equipment in the future  and such impairment could be material 
depreciation 
we provide for depreciation of our drilling rigs  transportation and other equipment on a straight line method over useful lives that we have estimated and that range from two to years after the rig was placed into service 
unlike depreciation based on units of production  our approach to depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle or when utilization changes 
we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight line basis despite the fact that our revenues and operating costs may vary with changes in utilization levels 
our estimates of the useful lives of our drilling  transportation and other equipment are based on our experience in the drilling industry with similar equipment 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill as of december  represented the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the purchase of thornton drilling company in we allocate the purchase price paid for the acquisition of a business to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values of those assets and liabilities 
these estimates are often highly subjective and may have a material impact on the amounts recorded for acquired assets and liabilities 
refer to taxes under results of operations for information regarding corrections made in to the purchase price allocation for thornton drilling company which impacted the carrying value of goodwill 

table of contents the company assesses the impairment of its goodwill annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the level of our reporting units 
in connection with the assessment of potential impairment of goodwill  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment is indicated 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we measure any impairment of goodwill in the reporting unit by allocating the fair value to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit based on their respective fair values 
any excess unallocated fair value would equal the implied fair value of goodwill  and if that amount is below the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment charge is recognized 
in light of the adverse market conditions affecting our common stock price beginning in the fourth quarter of  we utilized multiple market approaches to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit holding goodwill 
in developing these fair value estimates  there is considerable judgment involved  particularly in determining the valuation methodologies to utilize and the weighting of different valuation methodologies applied 
certain key assumptions included the trading day period over which to assess market capitalization  implied control premium  multiples of earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and forecasted operating results 
based on the results of the first step of the impairment test  an impairment of our goodwill was indicated 
the allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit indicated no residual value for goodwill  and accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
the fair market values of identified intangible assets acquired in the purchase of thornton drilling company were determined by an independent valuation and certain intangible assets will be amortized to expense over the estimated useful lives 
customer relations are amortized over their estimated benefit period of years 
intangibles related to the non compete agreement were amortized over the period of the non compete agreement of two years 
other intangibles are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment are present 
in  a million trade name impairment charge was recognized when the company decided to cease using the thornton drilling company name in its operations 
deferred taxes 
we record deferred taxes for the basis difference in our property and equipment between financial reporting and tax reporting purposes and other costs such as compensation  employee benefits and other accrued liabilities which are deductible in different periods for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes 
for property and equipment  basis differences arise from differences in depreciation periods and methods and the value of assets acquired in a business acquisition where we acquire the stock of an entity rather than its assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we depreciate the various components of our drilling rigs and refurbishments over two to years  while federal income tax rules require that we depreciate drilling rigs and refurbishments over five years 
in  tax depreciation also included bonus depreciation allowed as a result of the economic stimulus act of therefore  in the earlier years of our ownership of a drilling rig  our tax depreciation exceeds our financial reporting depreciation  resulting in our recording deferred tax liabilities on this depreciation difference 
in later years  financial reporting depreciation exceeds tax depreciation  and the deferred tax liability begins to reverse 
refer to taxes under results of operations for information regarding corrections made in to the income tax provision and deferred tax balances for underreporting of meals and incidental expenses that are only deductible for income tax purposes and to recognize the deferred tax liability attributable to non deductible intangibles acquired from thornton drilling company 
accrued workers compensation 
the company accrues for costs under our workers compensation insurance program in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
we have a deductible of  per covered accident under our workers compensation insurance 
our insurance policy requires us to maintain a letter of credit to cover payments by us of that deductible 
as of december  and  we satisfied this requirement with a million and million  respectively  letter of credit with our bank and our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement with our bank has been reduced by the same amount collateralizing such letter of credit 
we accrue for these costs as claims are incurred based on cost estimates established for each claim by the insurance companies providing the administrative services for processing the claims  including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  estimates for claims paid directly by us  administrative costs associated with these claims and our historical experience with these types of claims 
some of our employees are considered to be shared employees 
these employees are primarily engaged in our texas field operations and consisted of approximately employees at december  under this arrangement  we pay a fee for certain human resource functions  including the worker s compensation and payroll liabilities  to be assumed by the third party professional employer organization 
in addition  we accrue on a monthly basis the estimated workers compensation premium payable to ohio  a monopolistic state 

table of contents stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  revised sfas no 
r which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be measured at fair value and recognized in the financial statements 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award and included in general and administrative expense 
the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date is at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that is vested at that date 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded total stock based compensation expense of approximately million million net of tax    net of tax and million  net of tax  respectively 
total unamortized stock based compensation was approximately million at december   and will be recognized over a weighted average service period of years 
the tax benefit realized from stock options exercised during the twelve months ended december  and is included as a cash inflow from financing activities on the statement of cash flows 
estimating the fair value of options granted requires us to utilize valuation models and to establish several underlying assumptions 
the fair value of option grants was estimated using the black scholes option valuation model based on the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rate expected life years years years dividend yield expected volatility the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options 
the expected lives of the options are determined based on the company s expectations of individual option holders anticipated behavior and the term of the option 
the company has not paid out dividends historically  thus  the dividend yield is estimated at zero percent 
volatility is based upon price performance of the company and a peer company  as the company does not have a sufficient historical price base to determine potential volatility over the term of the issued options 
results of operations our operations primarily consist of drilling natural gas wells for our customers under daywork contracts and  to a lesser extent  footage contracts 
contract terms we offer generally depend on the complexity and risk of operations  the on site drilling conditions  the type of equipment used and the anticipated duration of the work to be performed 
our contracts generally provide for the drilling of multiple wells or a specific period of time for which the rig will be under contract 

table of contents statements of operations analysis the following table provides selected information about our operations for the years ended december   and in thousands 
years ended december  revenues operating expenses depreciation and amortization impairment charge general and administrative expense interest expense other income and gain on sale or disposal of fixed assets effective income tax rate revenues 
our revenues grew by million  or  in compared to  primarily due to million of revenue related to four new large rigs being deployed in the latter part of the third quarter of due to their greater capacity  these new rigs earn a higher day rate than our smaller rigs 
the million  or  increase in revenues in compared to was primarily due to the addition of six new rigs in late and early this was partially offset by a lower demand for smaller rigs in our fleet 
these new rigs earned a day rate higher than the average rate earned in  thus increasing the average rate per day by  operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  in compared to the operating costs related to the four new rigs discussed above were million 
the remaining increase was due to increases in wages  vehicle and fuel expense  supplies and repairs and maintenance costs 
the million  or increase in operating expenses during compared to was primarily due to the new rigs placed into service in late and early depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  primarily due to the increase in depreciable assets 
capital expenditures for rig purchases and capital equipment upgrades were million in  of which million represents construction in progress at december  our depreciation and amortization expense in increased by million  or  from due to the increase in depreciable assets 
capital expenditures in were million 
impairment charge 
the million impairment charge in is related to goodwill impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of in december  the company recognized a million impairment charge to write off the trade name intangible asset 
effective december   thornton drilling company  a then owned subsidiary  was merged with and into the company 
concurrently  the company decided to cease using the thornton drilling company name in its operations 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increase by million  or  in compared to as a result of the deteriorating economy and its impact on specific customers  our provision for doubtful accounts increased million in payroll expense increased million primarily due to additional wages to professional and administrative employees and other stock based compensation expense increased approximately  an additional  increase related to safety expenses  other consulting fees and property taxes 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased million  or in compared to payroll expenses increased million primarily due to additional wages to professional and administrative employees and a  increase in other stock based compensation expense 
in addition  million of the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increases in property taxes  property insurance and safety program costs primarily related to the new rigs placed into service in late and early these increases were partially offset by the decrease in nonrecurring expenses in  including  for consulting fees and  for certain relocation costs 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased approximately  in compared to  primarily due to the decrease in interest rates and higher capitalization of interest related to construction in progress during interest expense increased million in compared to due to the higher average balance on our revolving credit facility during and less interest capitalized related to construction in progress during the last nine months of other income and gain on sale or disposal of fixed assets 
other income and gain on sale or disposal of fixed assets decreased  in compared to and increased million in compared to primarily due to the sale of various utility vehicles at auction during the second quarter of the decrease in was partially offset by a  gain on involuntary conversions related to rig damages 
taxes 
our effective income tax rates of  and for  and  respectively  differ from the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to the non deductible goodwill impairment charge in  state income taxes and permanent book tax differences associated with limitation on meals and entertainment expense  the domestic manufacturing deduction in and and stock based compensation 
see note to our financial statements for further information on our income taxes 
during  the company corrected its income tax provisions and deferred tax balances for underreporting of meals and incidental expenses that are only deductible for income tax purposes and to recognize the deferred tax liability attributable to non deductible intangibles acquired from thornton drilling company 
this correction resulted in a  additional charge to the company s income tax provision attributable to the year ended december  this correction also resulted in a million increase to deferred tax liabilities  a million reduction in deferred tax assets  a million increase to recorded goodwill and a  increase to income taxes payable 
management concluded that the effect of the corrections was not material to any period impacted 
at both december  and  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately  these losses may be carried forward for years and will begin to expire in state net operating loss carryforwards at december  and were million and million  respectively 
state net operating loss carryforwards vary as to carryforward period and will begin to expire in  depending upon the jurisdiction where applied 
based upon results and forecasted future operations  we believe it is more likely than not that the amounts will be realized 
liquidity and capital resources our operations have historically generated sufficient cash flow to meet our requirements for debt service and equipment expenditures excluding major business and asset acquisitions 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million and million during and  respectively 
during  cash flow provided by operating activities was driven by net income plus non cash depreciation and amortization  goodwill impairment and provision for deferred income taxes which totaled million 
the million improvement in cash flow from operating activities for over was primarily due to our reduced investment in working capital in and an increase in net income after adjusting for the non cash cost of depreciation and amortization and non cash impairment 
during  due to a reduction in the average number of days to collect receivables  rather than a decline in revenue  our accounts receivable balance declined by million 
for  net income plus depreciation and amortization was million 
our cash flow from operations primarily was used to invest in new machinery and equipment as well as for capitalized upgrades to our fleet 
during and  cash used in investing activities totaled million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   our cash flow from financing activities was million  consisting primarily of the million increase in our net borrowings on our revolving credit and security agreement and other debt  and partially offset by 
table of contents million used for treasury stock purchases during the fourth quarter of the increase in our loan balance on our credit facility from million at december  to million at december  was primarily the result of the excess of our cash paid for capital expenditures of million over our million cash flow from operations 
during  our cash flow used in financing activities was million  primarily due to the million net debt repayments and partially offset by million in stock option exercise proceeds and related tax benefit 
compared to  our pace of acquisitions slowed in the second half of with a more balanced market for contract drilling services and fewer opportunities to invest in drilling rigs secured by term contracts  we used cash flow from operating activities to reduce the company s outstanding debt 
this resulted in an million reduction of the loan balance under our revolving credit and security agreement from million on december  to million on december  we believe cash generated by our operations and our ability to borrow the currently unused portion of our revolving credit and security agreement of approximately million  after reductions for approximately million outstanding letters of credit as of december   should allow us to meet our routine financial obligations for the foreseeable future 
given the current economic environment  management intends to continue its active monitoring of all internal and external factors which could have a negative impact on the company s liquidity and  to the extent reasonably practicable  take appropriate mitigating actions as management may then deem to be warranted 
sources of capital resources our rig fleet has grown from rigs in to marketed rigs at december  we have financed this growth with a combination of debt and equity financing 
at december   our total debt to total capital was approximately 
due to the volatility of rig demand in our industry  we are reluctant to take on additional debt in excess of the million of remaining availability under our revolving credit facility 
however  our ability to continue funding our growth through the issuance of shares of our common stock is uncertain  as our common stock is not heavily traded and the market price for our common stock has been volatile in recent periods 
we entered into a revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank  for itself and as agent for a group of lenders  in march this credit facility has been amended numerous times  most recently on september  this credit facility matures on march  and provides for a borrowing base equal to million 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest  depending upon facility usage  at either i the higher of the federal funds open rate plus to basis points or pnc bank s base commercial lending rate at december  or ii libor plus to basis points at december  
interest on outstanding loans is due monthly for domestic rate loans and at the end of the relevant interest period for libor loans 
depending upon our facility usage  we are assessed an unused line fee of to basis points on the available borrowing capacity 
the available borrowing capacity was million as of december  there is a million sublimit for letters of credit 
if we repay and terminate the obligations under this facility  we would be liable for a substantial prepayment penalty 
in general  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets the liquidation value of our assets serving as collateral is determined annually by an independent appraisal  with adjustments for acquisitions and dispositions between appraisals 
the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and also provides for events of default that are typical for such an agreement 
among the affirmative covenants are requirements to maintain a specified tangible net worth and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
among the negative covenants are restrictions on major corporate transactions  incurrence of indebtedness and amendments to our organizational documents 
events of default would include a change in control and any change in our operations or condition  which has a material adverse effect 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
to date  the credit facility primarily has been used to pay for rig acquisitions and for our working capital requirements 
cash used for capital expenditures for was million  and was primarily for drilling equipment 
the credit facility may also be used by the company  subject to certain conditions  to repurchase its common stock and or pay a cash dividend 
during the fourth quarter of  treasury stock purchases totaled million 
as of december   we had a loan balance of million under the credit facility  and an additional million of the total capacity had been utilized to support our letter of credit requirement 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit facility and million of the total capacity had been utilized to support our letter of credit requirement 
cash used for capital expenditures for was million  and was also primarily for drilling equipment 

table of contents in addition  the company has entered into various equipment specific financing agreements with several third party financing institutions 
the terms of these agreements range from to months 
as of december  and  the total outstanding balance under these arrangements was approximately million and million  respectively  and is classified  according to payment date  in current portion of notes payable for equipment and long term notes payable for equipment in the accompanying balance sheets 
the stated interest rate on these borrowings ranges from zero percent to 
uses of capital resources for the years ended december  and  the additions to our property and equipment consisted of the following in thousands years ended december  buildings drilling rigs and related equipment vehicles computer equipment our capital expenditures program in included the purchase or partial payments associated with eight new rigs for which we had agreements with customers to deploy the rigs under term contracts 
in addition  we upgraded and enhanced several of the existing rigs and related equipment in our fleet 
in particular  four rigs were upgraded with new  horsepower drawworks  and two new  pound derricks were installed and numerous rigs received higher horsepower mud pumps to facilitate longer reach horizontal drilling 
most of this capital spending was tied to improved dayrates and extension of term contracts to provide a return on the incremental capital
