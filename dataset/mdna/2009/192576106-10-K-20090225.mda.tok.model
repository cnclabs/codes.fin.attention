item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our primary business activity involves the development  manufacture  marketing  sale and servicing of test handling and burn in related equipment and thermal sub systems for the global semiconductor industry 
this business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors  which in turn are dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors that are subject to significant cyclical trends in demand 
like other companies in the backend semiconductor equipment industry  our primary business has been severely impacted by the global economic crisis 
consumer and business confidence has decreased dramatically  resulting in lower sales of electronic products and sharply reduced demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment 
we expect that the semiconductor equipment industry will continue to be cyclical and volatile in part because consumer electronics  rather than personal computers  are now the principal end market for integrated circuits 
demand for consumer electronic products is difficult to accurately predict and product life cycles are becoming shorter 
integrated circuit manufacturers are unwilling to absorb the carrying costs of excess capacity  and as a result  delay placing large orders with equipment suppliers until business conditions are favorable 
changes in the semiconductor  electronics  computer and telecommunications industries  as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions  have had and will continue to have a significant impact on the results of operations of our primary business 
conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry were difficult during fiscal this already challenging environment for semiconductor equipment has been further impacted by the global economic crisis 
customers for backend semiconductor equipment have suspended capital spending for new equipment and reduced purchases of spares and non essentials 
current visibility in the backend semiconductor industry is limited and we expect business conditions to remain difficult  at least for the next several quarters 
through this downturn  we plan to continue to invest in new product development and key initiatives to improve gross margin and operating performance that will benefit the results of operations of our primary business when industry conditions improve 
in response to these weak business conditions  we have taken actions to reduce costs and conserve cash  including headcount reductions  pay cuts  suspension of the company s matching contribution to our k plan  reduced work hours and mandatory time off 
on december  we completed the acquisition of rasco 
through this acquisition we combine delta  a leading supplier of logic pick and place ic test handlers with rasco  a leading supplier of gravity feed handlers 
this expands our semiconductor test handling product line total available market  extends our market leadership in ic test  expands our customer base  broadens our product and technology offerings and further strengthens our global sales and service network 
our operating results in the last three years have been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues 
these charges totaled approximately million during the three year period ended december  approximately million in the year ended december  and were primarily the result of decreases in customer forecasts  competitive conditions in the test handler industry and  to a lesser extent  changes in our sales product mix 
exposure related to inventories is common in the semiconductor equipment industry due to the narrow customer base  the custom nature of the products and inventory and the shortened product life cycles caused by rapid changes in semiconductor manufacturing technology 
increased competition  particularly in the last several years  has also negatively impacted our gross margins on certain products and we believe it is likely these conditions will exist for the foreseeable future 
our non semiconductor equipment businesses have comprised approximately of our consolidated revenues during the last three years and have not seen the same drop off in business as our semiconductor equipment business 
customers in our microwave communications and television camera business are primarily government and military in nature and the buying cycles are typically longer that in the commercial market place 
during fiscal  our television camera and microwave communications businesses underperformed and we implemented strategies which we believed would help improve the profitability of these businesses 
these initiatives included the introduction of new products and a strategic acquisition 
during fiscal we saw improved sales  operating income and orders within our microwave equipment operation 
during  bms achieved record sales and order backlog 
while the net operating results of our television camera business have continued to underperform during fiscal  customer interest is strong for new products developed for the high end security and surveillance markets and we anticipate that order levels will increase in the future 

table of contents our management team uses several performance metrics to manage our various businesses 
these metrics  which tend to focus on near term forecasts due to the limited order backlog in our businesses  include i order bookings and backlog for the most recently completed quarter and the forecast for the next quarter  ii inventory levels and related excess exposures typically based on the next twelve month s forecast  iii gross margin and other operating expense trends  iv industry data and trends noted in various publicly available sources  and v competitive factors and information 
due to the short term nature of our order backlog that historically has represented about three months of business and the inherent volatility of the semiconductor equipment business  our past performance is frequently not indicative of future near term operating results or cash flows 
application of critical accounting estimates and policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience  forecasts and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  however actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates  that are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   that we believe are the most important to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment include revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales to customers  which impacts our results from operations  estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically product warranty  inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts  which impact gross margin or operating expenses  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits  which impact our tax provision  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses if we are required to record impairments of assets or accelerate their depreciation  and the valuation and recognition of share based compensation  which impacts gross margin  research and development expense  and selling  general and administrative expense 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  however  these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
share based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  statement no 
r and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab no 
requiring the measurement and recognition of all share based compensation under the fair value method 
during fiscal  we began recognizing share based compensation  under statement no 
r  for all awards granted in fiscal and for the unvested portion of previous award grants based on each award s grant date fair value 
we implemented statement no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method our financial statements and related information presented pertaining to periods prior to our adoption of statement no 
r  have not been adjusted to reflect the fair value of share based compensation expense 
we estimate the fair value of each share based award on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model 
option valuation models  including black scholes  require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award 
these assumptions include the risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the risk free rate of interest is based on the us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term of the award 
expected dividends are based primarily on historical factors related to our common stock 
expected volatility is based on historic  weekly stock price observations of our common stock during the period immediately preceding the share based award grant that is equal in length to the award s expected term 
we believe that historical volatility is the best estimate of future volatility and utilize historical option exercise data for estimating the expected life of awards 
statement no 
r also requires that estimated forfeitures be included as a part of the grant date estimate 
we used historical data to estimate expected employee behaviors related to option exercises and forfeitures 

table of contents at december   excluding a reduction for forfeitures  we had approximately million and million of pre tax unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock units which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years and years  respectively 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue upon shipment and title passage for established products ie  those that have previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements that provide for full payment tied to shipment 
revenue for products that have not previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements or from sales where customer payment dates are not determinable is recognized upon customer acceptance 
for arrangements containing multiple elements  the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred at estimated fair value until delivery of the deferred elements 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty we provide for the estimated costs of product warranties in the period sales are recognized 
our warranty obligation estimates are affected by historical product shipment levels  product performance and material and labor costs incurred in correcting product performance problems 
should product performance  material usage or labor repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 
the demand forecast is a direct input in the development of our short term manufacturing plans 
we record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand  market conditions and product selling prices 
if future product demand  market conditions or product selling prices are less than those projected by management or if continued modifications to products are required to meet specifications or other customer requirements  increases to inventory reserves may be required which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
income taxes we estimate our liability for income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our i current tax exposure  ii temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes and iii unrecognized tax benefits 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
establishing  reducing or increasing a valuation allowance in an accounting period results in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the statement of operations 
we must make significant judgments to determine the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  unrecognized tax benefits and any valuation allowance to be recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our gross deferred tax asset balance as of december  was million  with a valuation allowance of million for state tax credit and loss carryforwards 
the deferred tax assets consist primarily of deductible temporary differences and tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets at december   finite intangible assets other than goodwill were evaluated for impairment using undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets as required by fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  statement no 
 and we concluded there was no impairment loss 
we are required to assess goodwill impairment using the methodology prescribed by fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  statement no 

under the provisions prescribed in statement no 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and if any events occur that suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our annual testing date is october we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of reporting units 
forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value 
table of contents measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer term trend 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test in and subsequent to october   we do not believe there have been any events or circumstances that would require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment review 
contingencies we are subject to certain contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of our businesses 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  statement no 
we assess the likelihood that future events will confirm the existence of a loss or an impairment of an asset 
if a loss or asset impairment is probable  as defined in statement no 
and the amount of the loss or impairment is reasonably estimable  we accrue a charge to operations in the period such conditions become known 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations  statement no 
r  which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination  including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
this statement also establishes disclosure requirements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
statement no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
statement no 
r will become effective for our fiscal year beginning in we expect statement no 
r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date of the revised standard 
we adopted fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  statement no 
on december   the first day of fiscal year statement no 
defines fair value  establishes a methodology for measuring fair value  and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which amends statement no 
by delaying its effective date by one year for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
therefore  beginning on december   this standard applies prospectively to new fair value measurements of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
on december   the beginning of our fiscal year  the standard will also apply to all other fair value measurements 
see note  fair value measurements  of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for additional information 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  statement no 

statement no 
expands the use of fair value measurement by permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
this statement is effective for us on december   the first day of our fiscal year 
we have not elected to measure any items at fair value under statement no 
and  as a result  statement no 
did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 statement no 

statement no 
requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  and the amount of consolidated net income  be clearly identified  labeled  and presented in the consolidated financial statements 
it also requires  once a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value 
sufficient disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and requires retrospective adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements shall be applied prospectively 
we are currently assessing the impact that statement no 
may have on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption in fiscal year 
table of contents in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 statement no 

statement no 
expands the current disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and requires that companies must now provide enhanced disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding how and why the entity uses derivatives  how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement no 
and how derivatives and related hedged items affect the company s financial position  performance and cash flows 
statement no 
is effective prospectively for periods beginning after november  as we do not currently enter into any derivative or hedging instruments we do not expect that statement no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon our adoption in fiscal year results of operations the following table summarizes certain operating data from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales for the three year period 
net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative acquired in process research and development gain on sale of facilities income loss from operations in may   we sold our metal detection equipment business  frl 
subsequent to the sale  the operating results of frl are being presented as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods have been reclassified accordingly 
unless otherwise indicated  the discussion and amounts provided in the results of operations section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k relate to continuing operations only 
in december   we purchased rasco 
the results of rasco s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
as required by fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d was expensed immediately upon the closing of the acquisition and therefore  million related to ipr d was included as an operating expense in our results of operations for the year ended december  compared to net sales our net sales decreased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor equipment in decreased from the comparable period and accounted for of consolidated net sales versus in the decrease in sales of semiconductor equipment was a result of weak conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry  particularly in the second half of fiscal as overall global economic conditions deteriorated 
additionally  sales of our semiconductor equipment business benefitted from the recognition of approximately million in net deferred revenue related to a certain semiconductor equipment product  on which customer acceptance was obtained in fiscal sales of television cameras accounted for of net sales in and increased when compared to the same period of the primary cause of this increase in sales was a result of demand for our specialty surveillance camera products and price increases 
additionally  sales of our television camera business benefitted from the recognition of approximately million in net deferred revenue 
sales of microwave communications equipment accounted for of net sales in and increased when compared to the increase in sales of our microwave communications business during fiscal was primarily attributable to demand for our products in surveillance and military applications and approximately million in incremental sales recognized as a result of our march  acquisition of avs 
additionally  sales of our microwave communications equipment business benefitted from the recognition of approximately million in previously deferred revenue 

table of contents gross margin gross margin consists of net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of materials  assembly and test labor  and overhead from operations 
our gross margin can fluctuate due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the mix of products sold  product support costs  inventory reserve adjustments  and utilization of manufacturing capacity 
our gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  was in and in in we recorded a charge to cost of sales of approximately million for excess and obsolete inventory as a result of a decline in customer forecasts for a burn in system  acquired from unisys unigen operation unigen 
during fiscal we sold certain of this inventory and our gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately million 
our gross margin has been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues and higher warranty costs associated with certain test handlers 
we compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a forward one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
while we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover our known exposures at december   reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products  as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements  will result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods 
conversely  if our actual inventory usage is greater than our forecasted usage  our gross margin in future periods may be favorably impacted 
research and development expense r d expense r d expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  product design and development activities  costs of engineering materials and supplies  and professional consulting expenses 
r d expense as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  decreasing from million in to million in decreased r d expense in was primarily a result of decreased labor and material costs within our semiconductor equipment businesses of approximately million  offset by an additional million and million of r d related costs incurred by our microwave communications and television camera businesses  respectively  resulting from the increased material costs associated with the design and development of new products and incremental costs associated with our march  acquisition of avs 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense sg a expense consists primarily of salaries and benefit costs of employees  commission expense for independent sales representatives  product promotion and costs of professional services 
sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  increasing from million in to million in the increase in sg a expense in was primarily a result of an additional million of sg a related costs incurred by our microwave communications business resulting primarily from increased sales commissions related to increased business volume  additional headcount  professional service costs and incremental expense associated with the march  acquisition of avs 
during administrative costs within our corporate organization increased million 
the increase in costs incurred by our microwave communications segment and corporate organization were offset by decreased costs within our semiconductor equipment segment of approximately million 
the decrease in costs incurred by our semiconductor equipment business is a result of decreased sales commissions and bad debt expense as a result of decreased business volume 
interest income interest income was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income resulted from lower short term interest rates and a decrease in our average cash and cash equivalents and investment balances 
additionally  during fiscal our interest income was negatively impacted by a loss of approximately million recorded on the sale of short term investments 
income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income was in and in the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes  research and development tax credits  settlement of prior year tax returns  ipr d with no tax benefit and changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  by the effects of statement no 
r that does not allow deferred tax benefits to be initially recognized on compensation expense related to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and interest expense recorded on unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents realization of our deferred tax assets is based upon the weight of all available evidence  including such factors as our recent earnings history and expected future taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the majority of these assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions or other factors not currently known or anticipated 
if the current worldwide economic and financial crisis continues for an extended period of time  realization of our deferred tax assets will be jeopardized and this may require us to increase our valuation allowance with a significant charge to income tax expense in future periods 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  statement no 
 net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance  net of federal benefit  of approximately million and million was provided on our deferred tax assets at december  and december   respectively  for state tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards that  in the opinion of management  are more likely than not to expire before we can use them 
our unrecognized tax benefits  excluding accrued interest  totaled approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
if these unrecognized tax benefits are ultimately recognized  this amount  less the related federal benefit for state items of approximately million and excluding any increase in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  would result in a reduction in our income tax expense and effective tax rate 
we do not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change over the next months 
we recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits  net of federal and state tax benefits  in income tax expense 
cohu had approximately million and million accrued for the payment of interest at december  and december   respectively 
interest expense recognized in and was approximately million and million  respectively 
in october  the internal revenue service commenced a routine examination of our us income tax return for this examination was substantially completed in and is expected to be finalized in without any material adjustments 
other items as a result of the factors set forth above  our net loss was million in  compared to net income of million in compared to net sales our net sales decreased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor equipment in decreased from the comparable period and accounted for of consolidated net sales versus in the primary cause of the decrease in sales of semiconductor equipment was a result of a decline in orders for our test handling and burn in related equipment which began in the second half of and carried into conditions in the back end semiconductor equipment industry were generally weak in at delta  these underlying and challenging industry dynamics were intensified by a sharp decline in orders for our highest margin product  the summit handler 
the decline in semiconductor test handler and burn in equipment orders was partially offset by the success of our new thermal sub system that began shipping during  however  this thermal sub system has a much lower selling price and gross margin than our summit test handler 
sales of television cameras accounted for of net sales in and decreased when compared to the same period of the primary cause of this decrease in sales is a result of decreased demand for our traffic camera products in transportation related applications 
sales of microwave communications equipment accounted for of net sales in and decreased when compared to during we saw an increase in demand for our microwave communications products primarily as a result of the acquisition of avs in march and strong demand from government agencies  however  total sales recognized by this segment decreased in due to the recognition of approximately million in revenue associated with our contract with the uae that was accepted and paid in the third quarter of 
table of contents gross margin our gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in our lower gross margin in was the result of lower margins in our semiconductor equipment business due to a change in product mix from our thermal test handlers to thermal sub system products 
our thermal sub system products have significantly lower gross margins than our thermal test handlers 
in addition to a shift in product mix  our gross margin has been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues and higher warranty costs associated with certain test handlers 
during and  we recorded net charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
approximately million of the charge recorded during was a result of a decline in customer forecasts for a burn in system  acquired from unigen  which negatively impacted our forecasted inventory usage 
research and development expense r d expense as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  decreasing from million in to million in decreased r d expense in was primarily a result of decreased labor and material costs within our semiconductor equipment and television camera businesses of approximately million and million  respectively  offset by an additional million of r d related costs incurred by our microwave communications business resulting from the march acquisition of avs  and other costs associated with new product development within that segment 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  decreasing from million in to million in the decrease in sg a expense in was primarily a result of a million decline in costs incurred by our semiconductor equipment business resulting from lower business volume due to the weak business conditions that existed within the back end semiconductor equipment industry during  a million decrease in costs incurred by our television camera business due to lower sales in  and million in decreased administrative costs within our corporate organization 
these reductions were offset by an additional million of sg a related costs incurred by our microwave communications business resulting from the march acquisition of avs  and increased legal costs 
interest income interest income was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in our average cash and cash equivalents and investment balances and higher interest rates 
income taxes the provision for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income was in and in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits  the effect of statement no 
r that does not allow deferred tax benefits to be recognized on compensation expense related to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
other items in may   we sold the land and building previously used by our operations in littleton  massachusetts 
the property was sold for million in cash  less related costs  resulting in a net pretax gain of approximately million that was recognized in in may   we sold substantially all the assets of our metal detection equipment business  frl 
the disposition resulted in a loss of approximately million that was recorded in amounts incurred in related to the disposition were not significant 
as a result of the factors set forth above  our income from continuing operations was million in  compared to million in our net income was million in  compared to million in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our business is dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and volatile 
we have implemented cost reduction programs aimed at aligning our ongoing operating costs with our currently expected revenues over the near term 
these cost management initiatives include consolidating facilities  reductions to headcount and reduced spending 
the cyclical and volatile nature of our industry makes estimates of future revenues  results of operations and net cash flows difficult 
our primary historical source of liquidity and capital resources has been cash flow generated by operations 
while we maintain a credit facility  we have not used this as a source of cash and do not intend to do so 
we use cash to fund growth in our operating assets  including accounts receivable and inventory  and to fund new products and product enhancements primarily through research and development 
liquidity working capital the following summarizes our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital december  december  percentage in thousands decrease change cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital cash flows operating activities cash generated from operating activities consists of net income or loss  adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash items include depreciation and amortization  non cash share based compensation expense  and deferred income taxes 
our net cash flows provided from operating activities in totaled million compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in profitability in and changes in current assets and liabilities which included a decrease in accounts receivable and accounts payable of million and million  respectively and an increase in inventories of million 
additionally  accrued compensation  warranty and other liabilities decreased million in the decrease in accounts receivable was a result of decreased business volume within our semiconductor equipment segment 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued compensation  warranty and other liabilities was primarily a result of decreased business volume and of the timing of cash payments primarily within our semiconductor equipment business 
the increase in inventory was primarily a result of purchases made to meet manufacturing requirements for new products developed by our semiconductor equipment business and a sudden drop in demand in the fourth quarter as a result of the global economic crisis 
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures in support of our businesses  proceeds from investment maturities  asset disposals and divestitures  and cash used for purchases of investments and business acquisitions 
our net cash used for investing activities in totaled million and was primarily the result of million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments  offset by million in cash used for purchases of short term investments and the purchase of rasco for million  net 
we invest our excess cash  in an attempt to seek the highest available return while preserving capital  in short term investments since excess cash is only temporarily available and may be required for a business related purpose 
the acquisition of rasco was a strategic transaction to expand our semiconductor test handling product line total available market  extend our market leadership in ic test  expand our customer base  broaden our product and technology offerings and strengthen our global service network 
other expenditures in included the purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment were primarily made to support activities in our semiconductor equipment and microwave communications business and consisted primarily of equipment used in engineering  manufacturing and related functions 
financing activities cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans which totaled million during we issue stock options and maintain an employee stock purchase plan as components of our overall employee compensation 
we declared and paid dividends totaling million  or per common share  during on february   we announced a cash dividend of per share on our common stock  payable on  april  to stockholders of record as of march  we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders 

table of contents capital resources in june   we renewed our million unsecured bank line of credit bearing interest at the bank s prime rate 
the line of credit will expire in july   and requires that we maintain specified minimum levels of net worth  limits the amount of our capital expenditures and requires us to meet certain other financial covenants 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants 
no borrowings were outstanding at december   however  approximately million of the credit facility was allocated to standby letters of credit at december   leaving the balance of million available for future borrowings 
we expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital and available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  amounts excluded include our liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately million at december  we are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods cash settlement of this liability may occur 
fiscal year total in thousands non cancelable operating leases purchase commitments from time to time  we enter into commitments with our vendors to purchase inventory at fixed prices or in guaranteed quantities 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons 
we typically do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide standby letters of credit instruments to certain parties as required 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these standby letters of credit was approximately million 
no liability has been recorded in connection with these arrangements beyond those required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we do not believe it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements

at december   our investment portfolio included short term  fixed income investment securities with a fair value of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates eg to would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we conduct business on a global basis and  as such  we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
except for our subsidiaries located in germany which conduct business in euros  we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars and as a result we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate ten percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
