item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we continue to pursue a strategy of increasing market share in existing and surrounding geographic markets through internal growth and selective acquisition of local and regional companies 
in addition  we will continue to expand into new geographic markets on a selective basis  either through acquisition or by opening new operating centers  when we believe it will enhance our business 
our focus remains primarily on oxygen and other respiratory therapy services  which represent approximately of our revenues 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lincare holdings inc and its subsidiaries 
we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenues are recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which services and related products are provided to customers and are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payors 
insurance benefits are assigned to the company and  accordingly  the company bills on behalf of its customers 
the company s billing system contains payor specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
the company has established an allowance to account for sales adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or when otherwise determined pursuant to the company s collection procedures 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
certain items provided by the company are reimbursed under rental arrangements that generally provide for fixed monthly payments established by fee schedules for as long as the patient is using the equipment and medical necessity continues subject to capped rental arrangements which limit the rental payment periods in some instances and which may result in a transfer of title to the patient at the end of the rental payment period 
once initial delivery of rental equipment is made to the patient  a monthly billing cycle is established based on the initial date of delivery 
the company recognizes rental arrangement revenues ratably over the monthly service period and defers revenue for the portion of the monthly bill that is unearned in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
no separate payment is earned from the initial equipment delivery and setup process 
during the rental period  we are responsible for servicing the equipment and providing routine maintenance  if necessary 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab for determining when revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the requirements of sab that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  
table of contents the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time products and or services are provided 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables 
unbilled accounts receivable represent charges for equipment and supplies delivered to customers for which invoices have not yet been generated by the billing system 
prior to the delivery of equipment and supplies to customers  we perform certain certification and approval procedures to ensure collection is reasonably assured and that unbilled accounts receivable are recorded at net amounts expected to be paid by customers and third party payors 
billing delays  generally ranging from several days to several weeks  can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources  interim transactions occurring between cycle billing dates established for each customer within the billing system and business acquisitions awaiting assignment of new provider enrollment identification numbers 
in the event that a third party payor does not accept the claim for payment  the customer is ultimately responsible 
we perform analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
specifically  we consider historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends and relevant business conditions 
because of continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that our estimates could change  which could have a material impact on our operations and cash flows 
bad debt expense  sales adjustments and related allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for sales adjustments and uncollectible accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are due from medicare  medicaid and private insurance carriers  as well as from customers under co insurance provisions 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process that involves submission of claims to multiple payors  each having its own claims requirements 
in some cases  the ultimate collection of accounts receivable subsequent to the service dates may not be known for several months 
bad debt is recorded as an operating expense and consists of billed charges that are ultimately deemed uncollectible due to the customer s or third party payor s inability or refusal to pay 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods  including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  and aging of accounts receivable 
our proprietary management information systems are utilized to provide this data in order to assess bad debts 
in the event that collection results of existing accounts receivable are not consistent with historical experience  there may be a need to increase our allowances for doubtful accounts  which may materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
the company has established an allowance to account for sales adjustments that result from differences between the payment amounts received from customers and third party payors and the expected realizable amounts 
actual adjustments that result from such differences are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or when otherwise determined pursuant to the company s collection procedures 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
business acquisition accounting the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  provide 
table of contents guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles for business acquisitions 
we apply the purchase method of accounting for business acquisitions  and use available cash from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and the assumption of certain liabilities as the consideration for business acquisitions 
we allocate the purchase price of our business acquisitions based on the fair market value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets 
the difference between the total cost of the acquisition and the sum of the fair values of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill and customer and contract relationships  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform a goodwill impairment test using a two step method on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares the company s fair value to its net book value to determine if there is an indicator of impairment 
if the assessment in the first step indicates impairment then the company performs step two 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for a business combination 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
in determining fair value  sfas no 
allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
the company calculates its fair value using two different approaches 
the first approach utilizes the closing market price of its common stock at the annual impairment testing date and the number of shares of common stock outstanding on that date 
the second approach utilizes a discounted cash flow projection which is based on assumptions that are consistent with the company s best estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business 
factors requiring significant judgment include the future cash flows  growth rates  discount factors and tax rates  amongst other considerations 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we completed the annual impairment test during the third quarter of and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
no recent events or circumstances have occurred to indicate that impairment may exist 
long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows that the asset s are expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value  which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or at the appraised value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived 
table of contents asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition and a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
we performed a recoverability test during the fourth quarter of in consideration of certain regulatory changes affecting medicare reimbursement in and beyond and determined the carrying value of our long lived assets are recoverable from undiscounted projected future cash flows 
contingencies we are involved in certain claims and legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles related to contingencies 
we evaluate and record liabilities for contingencies based on known claims and legal actions when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated

while we have achieved consistent results in managing bad debt expense over the past three years  the general economic climate and business acquisition activities may contribute to an increase in our bad debt expense in the future 
the collection of deductible balances and co payment amounts due directly from customers may be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions in the us the integration of acquired companies into our regional billing and collections offices may temporarily disrupt collections  increasing the amount of accounts receivable written off as uncollectible

income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes at both the federal and numerous state and local jurisdictions 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence 
as of december  we had state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of million 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized 
in recognition of this risk  we have provided a valuation allowance of million on the deferred tax assets relating to these state net operating loss carryforwards 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our national operations 
in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we adopted fin effective january  
table of contents we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with fin and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared with for the years ended december  and  respectively 
acquisitions in  the company acquired certain operating assets of three companies resulting in the addition of three new operating centers 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to current assets  million to property and equipment  million to separately identifiable intangible assets and million to goodwill 
in  the company acquired certain operating assets of three companies resulting in the addition of one new operating center 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to current assets  million to property and equipment  and million to goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been internally generated funds from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from equity and debt transactions 
we have used these funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of operating costs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service and share repurchases 
at december   our working capital was million 
at december   our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by million  resulting in negative working capital 
the working capital deficit in was primarily attributable to the reclassification of our million principal amount of convertible senior debentures the debentures to a current liability due to the right of the holders to put the securities to us for cash within one year of the december  balance sheet 
the debentures were redeemed in full on june  a significant portion of our assets consists of accounts receivable from third party payors that are responsible for payment for the equipment and services we provide 
our dso was days as of december  and days as of december  we measure our dso by dividing our net accounts receivable at the balance sheet date by the product of our latest quarterly net revenues times four  multiplied by days 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing and financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
activity in the year ended december  included our investment of million in business acquisitions  net investment in property and equipment of million  payments of debt of million and million in payments to repurchase our common stock  offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of debt and proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common shares 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement  dated december   makes available to us up to million over a five year period  subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the agreement 
as of december   there were million of standby letters of credit issued under the credit facility 

table of contents at december   the company held million of auction rate securities 
these securities are variable rate debt instruments with contractual maturities between the years and with interest rates that reset every seven or days pursuant to a bidding process as determined by the underlying security indentures 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the investments are classified as trading securities and are carried at fair value  with any realized and unrealized gains and losses included in other income and expense 
during the first quarter of  the company reclassified all of its investments in auction rate securities from short term to long term investments 
of the auction rate securities held as of december   million are secured by pools of student loans guaranteed by state designated guaranty agencies or monoline insurers or reinsured by the united states government 
all of the auction rate securities held by the company are senior obligations under the applicable indentures authorizing the issuance of such securities 
recent turmoil in the credit markets has resulted in widespread failures to attract demand for such securities at the periodic auction dates occurring subsequent to december  as of december   all of the securities held by the company continued to experience auction failures  resulting in our continuing to hold such securities 
all of the auction rate securities owned by the company were purchased from ubs financial services  inc  a subsidiary of ubs ag ubs  and are held  for the benefit of the company  by ubs 
on august   ubs announced a settlement in principle with the securities and exchange commission  the new york attorney general and other state regulatory agencies to restore liquidity to remaining clients who hold auction rate securities 
in november  the company accepted an offer the ubs put option from ubs to sell to it at par value all of the company s remaining auction rate securities in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement 
under the settlement agreement  the company will be able to redeem all of its auction rate securities at par during a two year time period beginning june   while ubs may purchase all or some of the auction rate securities at par from the company at any time through july  pursuant to the company s acceptance of the offer  ubs purchased a portion of the company s then outstanding holdings of auction rate securities at par on november  in the amount of million 
the company elected to measure the ubs put option under the fair value option of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and recorded other income of approximately million before income taxes  and recorded a corresponding long term investment 
the company valued the ubs put option using a discounted cash flow approach that takes into account certain estimates for interest rates and the timing and amount of expected future cash flows  adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
simultaneously  the company transferred these auction rate securities from available for sale to trading securities 
as a result of this transfer  the company recognized an unrealized loss recorded to other expense of approximately million before income taxes 
the recording of the ubs put option and the recognition of the unrealized loss resulted in no net impact to the consolidated statements of operations for the three and twelve month periods ended december  the company anticipates that any future changes in the fair value of the ubs put option will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities with no material net impact to the consolidated statements of operations 
the ubs put option will continue to be measured at fair value until the earlier of its maturity or exercise 
we will continue to monitor credit market conditions to assess the liquidity of our investments and access to external sources of capital 
due to our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents  amounts available under our revolving credit facility  and our expected operating cash flows  we believe that we have adequate liquidity available to meet our obligations 
on february   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan whereby the company may repurchase from time to time  on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  shares of the company s common stock in amounts determined pursuant to a formula the share repurchase formula that takes into account both the ratio of the company s net debt to cash flow and its available cash resources and 
table of contents borrowing availability 
on january  and october   our board of directors approved modifications to the share repurchase formula to increase the ratio of debt to cash flow to allow additional share repurchases 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased and retired  shares for million pursuant to the repurchase plan 
as of december   million of the company s common stock was eligible for repurchase in accordance with the amended formula 
on october   we completed the sale of million principal amount including exercise of a million over allotment option of convertible senior debentures due series a the series a debentures and million principal amount including exercise of a million over allotment option of convertible senior debentures due series b the series b debentures and together with the series a debentures  the series debentures in a private placement 
the series debentures pay interest semi annually at a rate of per annum 
the series debentures are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will be convertible under specified circumstances based upon a base conversion rate  which  under certain circumstances  will be increased pursuant to a formula that is subject to a maximum conversion rate 
upon conversion  holders of the series debentures will receive cash up to the principal amount  and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of our common stock or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock  at our option 
the initial base conversion rate for the debentures is shares of common stock per  principal amount of series debentures  equivalent to an initial base conversion price of approximately per share 
in addition  if at the time of conversion the applicable price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price  holders of the series a debentures and series b debentures will receive an additional number of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the debentures  as determined pursuant to a specified formula 
we will have the right to redeem the series a debentures and the series b debentures at any time after november  and november   respectively 
holders of the series debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or some of their series debentures upon the occurrence of certain fundamental change transactions or on november     and in the case of the series a debentures and november     and in the case of the series b debentures 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
fsp apb specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
upon adoption  the debt component of such instrument would be recognized by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
the equity component of such instrument would be recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability component 
the fsp requires accretion of the resultant debt discount equal to the proceeds allocated to the equity component over the expected life of the debt 
we have estimated the fair value of the liability components of the series debentures by calculating the present value of the cash flows of similar liabilities without associated equity components 
in performing those calculations  we have estimated that instruments similar to the series a and b notes without a conversion feature as of the date of issuance would have had and rates of return respectively and expected lives of five and seven years respectively 
these estimated rates of return were based on the company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance and the expected lives were based on the holder s put option features embedded in the notes 
to the extent that the initial proceeds of the instruments exceed the fair value of the liability components as estimated in the preceding sentence  we will recognize an equity component 
as a result  we estimate that  upon adoption  approximately million and million of the carrying value of the company s series a and b convertible notes will be reclassified to equity as of the october  issuance date 
these amounts represent the equity components of the proceeds from the notes 
we will also recognize debt discounts equal to the equity components which will be accreted to interest expense over the respective and year terms of the first put option dates specified in the indentures underlying the notes 
the accreted interest plus the cash interest payments based on the stated coupon rates will result in interest cost being recognized in the income statement that will reflect the interest rates on similar instruments without a conversion option 

table of contents debt issuance costs which are amortized to interest expense do not include issuance costs allocated to the equity component which are recorded as a reduction of the proceeds allocated to the equity component by means of a credit to additional paid in capital 
the basis of the liability component in accordance with the fsp and the liability in accordance with tax accounting will result in a deferred tax liability recorded at initial recognition which will reduce additional paid in capital 
the initial deferred tax liability will be equal to the initial debt discount times the company s tax rate 
the deferred tax liability will subsequently be amortized out of additional paid in capital as the debt discount is amortized 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company will adopt fsp apb beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  and this standard must be applied on a retrospective basis 
accordingly  we estimate that the pre tax increase in non cash interest expense to be recognized on our consolidated financial statements using our estimated comparable straight debt borrowing rates at the date of issuance of the series debentures would be as follows in thousands series a pre tax increase in non cash interest series b pre tax increase in non cash interest total pre tax increase in non cash interest these interest costs are related solely to the amortization of the debt discount 
debt issuance costs are not considered in this calculation 
in june  we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures in a private placement 
the debentures were convertible into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount of debentures 
interest on the debentures was payable at the rate of per annum on june and december of each year 
on june   we redeemed all of the outstanding debentures at par pursuant to a notice of redemption 
we funded the redemption with million of available cash and million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the entire amount of the borrowings under the credit facility were paid down from operating cash flow by the end of our future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon our operating cash flow and management of accounts receivable 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with our current cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  fund anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures  and meet our contractual obligations for the next year 
accounts receivable the company maintains payor specific price tables in its billing system that reflect the fee schedule amounts statutorily in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
due to the nature of the health care industry and the reimbursement environment in which lincare operates  situations can occur where expected payment amounts are not established by fee schedules or contracted rates  and estimates are required to record revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that revenues and accounts receivable will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
contractual adjustments to revenues and accounts receivable can result from price differences between allowed 
table of contents charges and amounts initially recognized as revenue due to incorrect price tables or subsequently negotiated payment rates 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or account review 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for sales adjustments and uncollectible accounts 
bad debt is recorded as an operating expense and consists of billed charges that are ultimately deemed uncollectible due to the customer s or third party payor s inability or refusal to pay 
the company s payor mix is highly concentrated among medicare  medicaid and other government third party payors and contracted private insurance or commercial payors 
government payment rates are determined according to published fee schedules established pursuant to statute  law or other regulatory processes and commercial payment rates are based on contractual line item pricing as reflected in the respective contracts 
fee schedule updates have historically occurred on a prospective basis and have been made available to the company in advance of the effective date of a change in reimbursement rates 
the company s proprietary billing system has features that allow the company to timely update payor price tables within the system as changes occur in order to accurately record revenues and accounts receivable at their expected realizable values 
additional systems and manual controls and processes are used by management to evaluate the accuracy of these recorded amounts 
based on the company s experience  it is unlikely that a change in estimate of unsettled amounts from third party payors would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations

table of contents the company operates regional billing and collection offices rbcos that are responsible for the billing and collection of accounts receivable 
the rbcos are aligned geographically to support the accounts receivable activity of the operating centers within their assigned territories 
as of december  and  there were  and  full time employees in the rbcos 
accounts receivable collections are performed by designated collectors within each of the rbcos 
the collectors use various reporting tools available within the company s proprietary billing system to identify claims that have been denied or partially paid by the responsible party and claims that have not been processed by the third party payor in a timely manner 
collections of accounts receivable are typically pursued using direct phone contact to determine the reason for non payment and  if necessary  corrected claims are prepared for resubmission and further follow up with the responsible party 
in some cases  third party payors have developed electronic inquiry methods that the company can access to determine the status of individual claims 
the company has benefited from the increasing availability of electronic funds transfers from payors  which now account for approximately of all payments received 
the company believes that its collection procedures contribute to its accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso and bad debt expense being among the lowest in its industry  according to published industry data and public filings of some of its competitors 
the ultimate collection of accounts receivable may not be known for several months 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods and analyses  including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  aged accounts receivable and consideration of any payor specific concerns 
the ultimate write off of an accounts receivable occurs once collection procedures are determined to have been exhausted by the collector and after appropriate review of the specific account and approval by supervisory and or management employees within the rbcos 
management and rbco supervisory and management employees also review accounts receivable write off reports  correspondence from payors and individual account information to evaluate and correct processes that might have contributed to an unsuccessful collection effort 
the company does not use an aging threshold for account receivable write offs 
however  the age of an account balance may provide an indication that collection procedures have been exhausted  and would be considered in the review and approval of an account balance write off

new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas no 
were effective as of the beginning of the calendar year 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

on january  the company adopted sfas no 
which permits companies to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the fair value option 
the fair value election is irrevocable and may generally be made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
the company chose not to elect the fair value option for its financial assets and liabilities existing on january   and did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets and liabilities transacted during the twelve months ended december   except for a put option related to the company s auction rate securities that was recorded in conjunction with a settlement agreement with one if its investment firms  as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources and in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
it also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from certain contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are effective as of the beginning of the calendar year 
the company is currently evaluating the potential future impact of this standard on its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  to calendar years beginning january  the scope of the proposed deferral applies to all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we do not expect the adoption of fsp fas to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
fsp apb specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
upon adoption  the debt component of such instrument would be recognized by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
the equity component of such instrument would be recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability component 
the fsp requires accretion of the resultant debt discount equal to the proceeds allocated to the equity component over the expected life of the debt 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company will adopt fsp apb beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  and this standard must be applied on a retrospective basis 
for a full discussion of the impact to the company s consolidated financial statements  please refer to liquidity and capital resources and to note v to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active  which clarifies the application of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  in an inactive market and provides an illustrative example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
key existing principles of statement illustrated in the example include a fair value represents the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants  even if there is little or no market activity for an asset at the measurement date  the objective of determining fair value remains the same  b in determining fair value  the use of management s internal assumptions concerning future cash flows discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted interest rate is acceptable when relevant observable market data do not exist  c broker quotes may properly be included as an input when measuring fair value but such quotes are not necessarily determinative if an active market for the financial asset does not exist 
the provisions of fsp fas are effective upon issuance 
the adoption of fsp fas did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation we currently do not anticipate any material increases in the near term in either the cost of supplies or operating expenses due to inflation 
with reductions in reimbursement by government and private medical insurance programs and pressure to contain the costs of such programs  we bear the risk that reimbursement rates set by such programs will not keep pace with inflation

the management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments 
we maintain a decentralized approach to management of our local business operations 
decentralization of managerial decision making enables our operating centers to respond promptly and effectively to local market demands and opportunities 
we provide home health care equipment and services through  operating centers in states 
we view each operating center as a distinct part of a single operating segment  as each operating center generally provides the same products to customers 
as a result  all of our operating centers are aggregated into one reportable segment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the fair values of our debt instruments are subject to change as a result of changes in market prices or interest rates 
we estimate potential changes in the fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account anticipated operating and financial transactions
