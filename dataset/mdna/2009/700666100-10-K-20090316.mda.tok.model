in november  our ils business changed its name to supply technologies to better reflect its breadth of services and focus on driving efficiencies throughout the total supply management process 
our supply technologies business provides our customers with total supply management tm  a proactive solutions approach that manages the efficiencies of every aspect of supplying production parts and materials to our customers manufacturing floor  from strategic planning to program implementation 
total supply management tm includes such services as engineering and design support  part usage and cost analysis  supplier selection  quality assurance  bar coding  product packaging and tracking  just in time and point of use delivery  electronic billing services and ongoing technical support 
the principal customers of supply technologies are in the heavy duty truck  automotive and vehicle parts  electrical distribution and controls  consumer electronics  power sports fitness equipment  hvac  agricultural and construction equipment  semiconductor equipment  plumbing  aerospace and defense  and appliance industries 
aluminum products casts and machines aluminum engine  transmission  brake  suspension and other components such as pump housings  clutch retainers pistons  control arms  knuckles  master cylinders  pinion housings  brake calipers  oil pans and flywheel spacers for automotive  agricultural equipment  construction equipment  heavy duty truck and marine equipment oems  primarily on a sole source basis 
aluminum products also provides value added services such as design and engineering and assembly 
manufactured products operates a diverse group of niche manufacturing businesses that design and manufacture a broad range of highly engineered products including induction heating and melting systems  pipe threading systems  industrial oven systems  injection molded rubber components  and forged and machined products 
manufactured products also produces and provides services and spare parts for the equipment it manufactures 
the principal customers of manufactured products are oems  sub assemblers and end users in the steel  coatings  forging  foundry  heavy duty truck  construction equipment  bottling  automotive  oil and gas  rail and locomotive manufacturing and aerospace and defense industries 
sales  earnings and other relevant financial data for these three segments are provided in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
during the years through  we refinanced both of our major sources of borrowed funds senior subordinated notes and our revolving credit facility 
in november  we sold million of senior subordinated notes due we have amended our revolving credit facility  most recently in june  to extend its maturity to december  increase the credit limit to million subject to an asset based formula and provide lower interest rate levels 
in october  we acquired all of the capital stock of nabs for million in cash 
nabs is a premier international supply chain manager of production components  providing services to high technology companies in the computer  electronics  and consumer products industries 
nabs had international operations in china  india  taiwan  singapore  ireland  hungary  scotland and mexico plus five locations in the united states 
in january  we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of foundry service for approximately million in cash  which resulted in additional goodwill of million 
the acquisition was funded with borrowings from foreign subsidiaries of the company 

table of contents in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of lectrotherm  which is primarily a provider of field service and spare parts for induction heating and melting systems  located in canton  ohio  for million cash funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
this acquisition augments our existing  high margin aftermarket induction business 
in july  we acquired substantially all the assets of ppg  a provider of supply chain management services for a broad range of production components for million cash funded with borrowings from our revolving credit facility  
million in a short term note payable and the assumption of approximately million of trade liabilities 
this acquisition added significantly to the customer and supplier bases  and expanded our geographic presence of our supply technologies segment 
the domestic and international automotive markets were significantly impacted in  which adversely affected our business units serving those markets 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded asset impairment charges associated with the recent volume declines and volatility in the automotive markets 
the charges were composed of 
million of inventory impairment included in cost of products sold and million for impairment of property and equipment and other long term assets 
see note o to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million and restructuring and asset impairment charges of million associated with the decision to exit its relationship with its largest customer  navistar  along with the general economic downturn 
the charges were composed of million of inventory impairment included in cost of products sold and million for impairment of property and equipment  loss on disposal of a foreign subsidiary and severance costs 
impairment charges were offset by a gain of 
million recorded in the aluminum products segment relating to the sale of certain facilities that were previously written off 
approximately of the company s consolidated net sales are to the automotive markets 
the recent deterioration in the global economy and global credit markets continues to negatively impact the automotive markets 
general motors  ford and chrsyler have encountered severe financial difficulty  which could ultimately result in the bankruptcy in one or more of these domestic automobile manufacturers  which  in turn  would adversely affect the financial condition of the company s automobile oem customers 
in  the company expects that its business  results of operations and financial condition will continue to be negatively impacted by the performance of the automotive markets

our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and funds available from existing bank credit arrangements and the sale of our senior subordinated notes 
in  we entered into a revolving credit facility with a group of banks which  as subsequently amended  matures at december  and provides for availability of up to million subject to an asset based formula 
the revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all our assets in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
borrowings from this revolving credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes 

table of contents amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility may be borrowed at the company s election at either i libor plus 
to or ii the bank s prime lending rate 
the libor based interest rate is dependent on the company s debt service coverage ratio  as defined in the revolving credit facility 
under the revolving credit facility  a detailed borrowing base formula provides borrowing availability to the company based on percentages of eligible accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and approximately million of unused borrowing availability 
current financial resources working capital and available bank borrowing arrangements and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be adequate to meet current cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the future availability of bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based on the company s ability to meet a debt service ratio covenant  which could be materially impacted by negative economic trends 
failure to meet the debt service ratio could materially impact the availability and interest rate of future borrowings

the company may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
it may also repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future 
these market conditions may limit the company s ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to grow and maintain its business 
accordingly  the company may be forced to delay raising capital  issue shorter tenors than the company prefers or pay unattractive interest rates  which could increase its interest expense  decrease its profitability and significantly reduce its financial flexibility 
there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit 
at december   the company was in compliance with the debt service ratio covenant and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility 
while we expect to remain in compliance throughout  further declines in demand in the automotive industry and in sales volumes in could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain of these financial covenants 
additionally  to the extent our customers are adversely affected by the declines in demand in the automotive industry or the economy in general  they may not be able to pay their accounts payable to us on a timely basis or at all  which would make those accounts receivable ineligible for purposes of the revolving credit facility and could reduce our borrowing base

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
there are occasions whereupon we enter into forward contracts on foreign currencies  primarily the euro  purely for the purpose of hedging exposure to changes in the value of accounts receivable in those currencies against the us dollar

the calculation of interest on debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and other variable rate debt million based on average interest rate and outstanding borrowings of million at december  is not included above due to the subjectivity and estimation required 
postretirement obligations include projected postretirement benefit payments to participants only through the table above excludes the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits disclosed in note h to the consolidated financial statements  since the company cannot predict with reasonable reliability  the timing of potential cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
we expect that funds provided by operations plus available borrowings under our revolving credit facility to be adequate to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions which affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that there is great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  other than from long term contracts  when title is transferred to the customer  typically upon shipment 
revenue from long term contracts approximately of consolidated revenue is accounted for under the percentage of completion method  and recognized on the basis of the percentage each contract s cost to date bears to the total estimated contract cost 
revenue earned on contracts in process in excess of billings is classified in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
allowances are developed by the individual operating units based on historical losses  adjusting for economic conditions 
our policy is to identify and reserve for specific collectibility concerns based on customers financial condition and payment history 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
writeoffs of accounts receivable have historically been low 
allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand with minimal sales activity  which is compared to estimated future usage and sales 
inventories identified by management as slow moving or obsolete are reserved for based on estimated selling prices less disposal costs 
though we consider these allowances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have a material effect on reserve allowances required 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during  and  the company decided to exit certain under performing product lines and to close or consolidate certain operating facilities and  accordingly  recorded restructuring and impairment charges as discussed above and in note o to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
restructuring we recognize costs in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf  and sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  for charges prior to detailed contemporaneous documentation is maintained and updated on a quarterly basis to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in the estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect the changes 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas  which nullified eitf and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at the fair value only when the liability is incurred 
fas has no effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to goodwill we adopted fas as of january  under fas  we are required to review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we have completed 
table of contents the annual impairment test as of october    and and have determined that no goodwill impairment existed as of those dates 
we completed the annual impairment tests as of october  and updated these tests  as necessary  as of december  see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates 
in determining these amounts  management determined the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical operating results  cumulative earnings and losses  expectations of future earnings and taxable income and the extended period of time over which the postretirement benefits will be paid and accordingly records a tax valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized as required by fas we made significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the extent that a valuation allowance should be provided against deferred tax assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans we and our subsidiaries have pension plans  principally noncontributory defined benefit or noncontributory defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  rate of compensation increases  and health care cost trends 
pension plan asset performance in the future will directly impact our net income 
we have evaluated our pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions  considering current trends in interest rates and market conditions and believe our assumptions are appropriate

environmental we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at third party sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or comparable state laws  which provide for strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability 
we are participating in the cost of certain clean up efforts at several of these sites 
however  our share of such costs has not been material and based on available information  our management does not expect our exposure at any of these locations to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we have been named as one of many defendants in a number of asbestos related personal injury lawsuits 
our cost of defending such lawsuits has not been material to date and  based upon available information  our management does not expect our future costs for asbestos related lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we caution  however  that inherent in management s estimates of our exposure are expected trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors that may materially vary as claims are filed and settled or otherwise resolved 
seasonality  variability of operating results our results of operations are typically stronger in the first six months than the last six months of each calendar year due to scheduled plant maintenance in the third quarter to coincide with customer plant shutdowns and due to holidays in the fourth quarter 
the timing of orders placed by our customers has varied with  among other factors  orders for customers finished goods  customer production schedules  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
the variability of the level and timing of orders has  from time to time  resulted in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the operations of our business units
