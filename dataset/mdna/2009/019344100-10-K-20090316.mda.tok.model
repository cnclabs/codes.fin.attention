table of contents part i item business history of allied nevada allied nevada is a gold mining company that operates the hycroft mine and has a large number of prospective exploration claims in the state of nevada 
based on management s belief and current life of mine plans  the hycroft mine is expected to reach normal annualized production rates of approximately  ounces of gold per year by the middle of these plans indicate that the hycroft mine should produce gold from the proven and probable ore reserves at these rates for approximately seven years 
at the hycroft mine  we will focus our exploration efforts on identifying additional oxide ore reserves that can extend the mine life and to continue to assess the economic potential of the sulfide mineralization that has been identified 
in addition to the hycroft mine  we have six properties which have reported other mineralized material and more than other early stage exploration properties 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our exploration portfolio to determine ways to increase the value of these properties 
allied nevada gold corp 
was incorporated under the laws of delaware on september  until may  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of vista gold corp 
vista  a corporation incorporated under the laws of the yukon territory  canada 
we commenced our operations on may   following vista s transfer to us of its nevada based mining properties and related assets  along with cash  and the transfer to us by carl pescio and janet pescio  together  the pescios of their interests in certain nevada mining properties and related assets 
these transfers to us were made in exchange for shares of our common stock and cash  under the terms of an arrangement and merger agreement arrangement agreement that we entered into with vista and the pescios on september   as amended 
before the arrangement agreement transactions were completed  we had no properties or property interests  were not yet conducting business operations and had no shareholders other than vista 
pursuant to the terms of the arrangement agreement  the parties completed a transaction that resulted in vista s transfer of the vista nevada assets to allied nevada along with cash  and the pescios transfer to allied nevada of the pescio nevada assets  all pursuant to the provisions of the business corporations act yukon territory 
allied nevada issued  shares of common stock as part of the transaction  of which  were issued to the pescios as partial consideration for the acquisition of the pescio nevada assets and  were issued to vista in accordance with the arrangement agreement 
in addition to the stock consideration  allied nevada paid the pescios million for the acquisition of the pescio nevada assets 
the new common shares of allied nevada common stock began trading on may   on the american stock exchange  which is now known as the nyse alternext us llc nyse alternext us or nyse a  and the toronto stock exchange 
in september  the board of directors approved the re opening of the hycroft mine hycroft development program 
the hycroft development program involved re opening the hycroft open pit mine which had been placed on a care and maintenance program  due to low gold prices  since the required capital and development spending was scheduled for with the objective of producing gold in the fourth quarter of general development of the business during during  the hycroft development program was completed with the production of gold in december the major activities that occurred during were the following in march  we purchased a used mining fleet consisting of five ton haul trucks  two yard wheel loaders  two blasthole drills and various pieces of support equipment 
during  this equipment was reassembled at the hycroft mine and was fully operational by the end of the year 
we 
table of contents also purchased additional production and ancillary equipment as required by the hycroft development program 
in april  we completed a cross border public offering of stock that consisted of a primary offering of  common shares and the exercise of an over allotment option consisting of an additional  common shares 
net proceeds of this offering were approximately million 
the net proceeds of this offering were utilized primarily to fund activities in connection with the hycroft development program  oxide and sulfide exploration activities on the hycroft property  as well as additional working capital and reclamation bonding 
the hycroft development program required us to strip waste overburden in the brimstone open pit to allow access to the ore 
this stripping program was completed in the third quarter of we completed the initial million square foot expansion of the brimstone leach pad system 
we placed this expanded brimstone leach pad system under leach during total production for december was approximately  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver which was a combination of dor and metal on carbon 
this dor will be refined into gold and silver bullion which will then be sold in the normal course of business 
by the end of  the mine operations are operating at the planned production levels of million tons of material per month 
during the first of five mining phases  we are utilizing a contractor to increase our mining output by approximately  tons of material per month 
this additional capacity will allow us to accelerate ore production from the brimstone open pit mine 
we are now in the start up phase of operation and  based on current life of mine plans  management believes we will attain annualized production rates of approximately  ounces by july over the six month start up period  production will progressively increase as we continue to leach existing ore and place new ore on the leach pad 
on october   we completed a sulfide resource update and an oxide reserve and resource update for the hycroft mine 
these updates were based upon an analysis of historical drill hole assay results and recent drill hole assay results from holes that had been drilled as part of the hycroft mine oxide and sulfide exploration drilling program 
these recent holes were drilled as part of an ongoing program to expand the hycroft gold and silver sulfide resource in the brimstone and silver camel areas as well as to define areas for potential gold and silver oxide reserves in other areas at the hycroft mine 
during  we drilled a total of mine development and exploration drill holes that totaled approximately  feet of drilling 
segment information we have operating segments of hycroft mine  exploration properties  and other 
the hycroft mine operating segment contains the exploration and operational activities at our wholly owned hycroft mine located in nevada 
the exploration properties segment contains the exploration and development activities on the remaining mineral properties owned by the company 
the other operating segment primarily contains the corporate overhead functions of the company 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements for information related to our business segments 
general description of the business of allied nevada allied nevada was incorporated in the state of delaware on september  and is domiciled in the united states of america and its corporate headquarters is located in reno  nevada 
we own the hycroft open pit mine  maverick springs a joint venture with silver standard resources inc silver standard  mountain view  hasbrouck  three hills and wildcat projects  the contact property and other nevada properties previously owned by vista  and pony creek elliot dome property package and the exploration rights to more than a hundred other earlier stage exploration properties 
see part i item properties 
all of these properties are located in the state of nevada 

table of contents we operate the wholly owned hycroft mine which is located miles west of winnemucca  nevada 
the hycroft mine is an open pit  heap leach gold mine that is expected to produce silver as a byproduct of the gold recovery process 
all currently identified ore reserves will be mined by open pit methods with a typical drill  blast  load  and haul cycle from two pits  the brimstone pit and the cut pit 
all ore grade material placed on the leach pad will be run of mine 
the pregnant solution will be processed using a carbon in leach solution recovery process cil process and a merrill crowe zinc precipitation process merrill crowe process that has been maintained in good operating condition since it was shut down in based on our current life of mine operations plans  management believes that the hycroft mine will attain full production capacity by the middle of and expects to produce gold at an annual production rate of approximately  ounces of gold per year thereafter 
management also believes that the mining of the current proven and probable reserves will permit the company to produce gold at these production levels for each of the next seven years 
management intends to continue its oxide exploration program with the objective of identifying additional proven and probable reserves that can extend the current mine life 
management also intends to continue its exploration of the sulfide mineralization and its economic evaluation of the feasibility of bringing a sulfide mine into production 
please refer to item properties and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information 
in addition to operating the hycroft mine  allied nevada is engaged in the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and development projects in the state of nevada 
our management searches for opportunities to improve the value of the gold projects that we own or control through exploration drilling  introducing technological innovations and developing properties into operating mines 
we expect that emphasis on gold project acquisition and development will continue in the future 
principal products allied nevada had no gold sales during the company is a production stage company that sold its first gold in we will generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during the month in which the gold is delivered to the customer 
we will recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable  the gold has been delivered  the title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
most of our revenue will come from the sale of refined gold in the international market 
the end product at our gold operations  however  is generally dor bars 
dor is an alloy consisting of gold  silver and other metals 
dor is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of pure gold 
under the terms of our refining agreements  the dor bars are refined for a fee  and our share of the refined gold and the separately recovered silver are credited to our account or delivered to our buyers 
in our dor  we expect that the contained value of the gold will be approximately times more than the contained value of the silver 
as such  we consider gold to be a principal product and silver to be a byproduct of the gold recovery process 
gold uses 
gold has two main categories of use fabrication and investment 
fabricated gold has a variety of end uses  including jewelry  electronics  dentistry  industrial and decorative uses  medals  medallions and official coins 
gold investors buy gold bullion  official coins and jewelry 
gold supply 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of current production from mining and the draw down of existing stocks of gold held by governments  financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals

business strategy our business plan was developed with the overriding goal of maximizing shareholder value through the operation of the hycroft mine  the exploration and development of our mineral properties  and through strategic partnerships 
to achieve this goal  our business plan focuses on three strategic areas hycroft mine hycroft open pit mine hycroft exploration drilling program exploration properties mergers and acquisitions until we start generating sufficient cash flow from gold production and production royalties  we are dependent on our working capital  funding from external sources and cash from advanced minimum royalty amr payments received with respect to interests in certain nevada based mining properties 
hycroft open pit mine the hycroft open pit mine  which we also refer to as the hycroft mine in this annual report on form k  is located miles west of winnemucca  nevada along the border of humboldt and pershing counties  and covers approximately  acres of mineral rights 
during  allied nevada completed the capital construction and development phases of the hycroft development program 
we are currently in the start up phase and  based on our current life of mine operating plans  management believes we will reach an annualized production rate of approximately  ounces of gold per year by mid year at full production  based upon our current assumptions and life of mine plan  the mine is expected to employ workers and will mine approximately million tons of material per annum 
the mining will be accomplished by open pit mining methods and the run of mine heap leach process will be used to recover gold 
table of contents from the ore 
silver will be produced as a byproduct of the gold extraction process 
solutions from the heap leach process will be further processed using cil process and merrill crowe process methods 
the final product of this process will be a dor which will contain gold and silver precious metals 
the dor will be refined by a third party refinery which will produce gold and silver bullions 
our operating objective at the hycroft mine is to mine the deposit in a profitable  safe  and environmentally friendly manner 
to attain this goal  we have focused on recruiting and retaining experienced executives  managers  and employees 
the team that has been formed by allied nevada has extensive specific experience in managing and operating mines utilizing the specific mining and processing methods used by the company 
this team has identified the appropriate technologies and developed the appropriate production management  health and safety programs and environmental management  monitoring  and protection programs

hycroft exploration drilling program increase of oxide reserves one of the objectives of the hycroft exploration drilling program is to further expand the existing oxide reserves on the hycroft property 
allied nevada has completed the initial phase of an oxide ore reserve delineation program at hycroft and announced expanded reserves during in the future  we plan to continue exploration drilling targeted at identifying additional oxide ore reserves to increase the proven and probable reserves and extend the current mine life at the property 
allied nevada completed an oxide ore reserve delineation program at hycroft during the first half of an updated reserve tabulation was released in the fourth quarter of the details of this reserve report are included in the business section  see part i item operating properties hycroft open pit mine operation 
additional holes  targeting oxide mineralization  were drilled in the second half of an updated reserve calculation is expected to be completed during the first half of testing of sulfide gold and silver mineralization the second objective of the hycroft exploration drilling program is to continue testing the economic viability of the sulfide gold and silver mineralization on the hycroft property 
during  an exploration drill program was completed to provide initial estimates of the sulfide mineralization at the hycroft mine 
we are currently assessing the results of this drilling and expect to release an updated sulfide resource update in the first half of during  the company began the metallurgical test work to focus on estimating the gold and silver recovery that could be attained from the sulfide material 
preliminary results are encouraging and we plan to continue with the metallurgical test work in in  we will also begin the engineering work required to complete a pre feasibility study in any expansion of the hycroft mine necessary to exploit any additional reserves that may be established through our hycroft exploration drilling program that are not located within our current mine plan  will require us to obtain all permits  approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in nevada 
for further discussions concerning these programs  see part i item properties development properties hycroft open pit mine hycroft exploration drilling program 
exploration properties our exploration properties portfolio consists of six advanced properties in maverick springs joint venture interest with silver standard  mountain view  hasbrouck  three hills  wildcat  and pony creek elliot dome and more than earlier stage exploration properties 
evaluation of these properties will be completed to 
table of contents determine each property s economic potential 
based on this evaluation  we will develop exploration programs  enter into joint venture exploration agreements  sell or dispose of these properties 
during  we completed initial broad scale mapping and geochemical sampling on all of our exploration properties 
additionally  silver standard completed an exploration program at our maverick springs joint venture  the details of which are included in part ii item properties exploration properties maverick springs 
for further discussions concerning our exploration properties  please see information concerning each property under part i item properties 
mergers and acquisitions we routinely review merger and acquisition opportunities 
our primary focus will be on those opportunities involving precious metal production or near term production with a secondary focus on other resource based opportunities 
potential acquisition targets would include private and public companies or individual properties 
although our preference would be for acquisition candidates located in the united states  allied nevada will consider opportunities located in other countries where the geopolitical risk is acceptable 
formation of allied nevada initial corporate organization allied nevada gold corp 
commenced operations in may we were incorporated under the laws of delaware on september  and until may  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of vista gold corp 
vista  a corporation incorporated under the laws of the yukon territory  canada 
we commenced our operations on may   following vista s transfer to us of its nevada based mining properties and related assets  along with cash  and the transfer to us by carl pescio and janet pescio the pescios of their interests in certain nevada mining properties and related assets 
these transfers to us were made in exchange for shares of our common stock and cash  under the terms of an arrangement and merger agreement that we entered into with vista and the pescios on september   as amended the arrangement agreement as summarized below 
in this document  we sometimes use the terms vista nevada assets and pescio nevada assets to refer to  respectively  vista s nevada based mining properties and related assets  and the pescios interests in certain nevada mining properties and related assets that were transferred to us pursuant to the arrangement agreement 
before the arrangement agreement transactions were completed  we had no properties or property interests  were not yet conducting business operations and had no shareholders other than vista 
arrangement agreement pursuant to the terms of the arrangement agreement  the parties completed a transaction that resulted in vista s transfer of the vista nevada assets to allied nevada along with cash  and the pescios transfer to allied nevada of the pescio nevada assets  all pursuant to an arrangement which we refer to as the arrangement agreement in this document under the provisions of the business corporations act yukon territory 
among other things  pursuant to the arrangement agreement vista reorganized its business to split the vista nevada assets from its other properties and related assets and ensured that all of the vista nevada assets were held by its wholly owned subsidiary  vista gold holdings inc vista us or subsidiaries wholly owned by vista us  vista subsequently transferred all issued and outstanding shares of vista us and million in cash to allied nevada less approximately million owed to vista in connection with loans that vista made to vista us pursuant to the arrangement agreement in return for  shares of allied nevada common stock  
table of contents the pescios transferred their interests in the pescio nevada assets to allied nevada gold holdings llc  a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of nevada with allied nevada as its sole member  in return for  shares of allied nevada common stock and million in cash from allied nevada  and holders of vista options exchanged their options for options to acquire allied nevada shares 
the new common shares of vista and the shares of allied nevada common stock began trading on may   on the nyse a f k a amex  and the tsx 
the issuance of securities by allied nevada to vista security holders pursuant to the arrangement agreement was not registered under the securities act or the securities laws of any state of the united states and was affected in reliance upon the exemption from registration under the securities act provided by section a thereof 
section a of the securities act exempts from registration a security that is issued in exchange for outstanding securities where the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved  after a hearing upon the fairness of such terms and conditions at which all persons to whom it is proposed to issue securities in such exchange have the right to appear  by a court or by a governmental authority expressly authorized by law to grant such approval 
the supreme court of the yukon territory  an authorized court  approved the arrangement agreement by a final order granted on november  the final order accordingly constituted a basis for the exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act with respect to the issuance of the securities of allied nevada to vista security holders pursuant to the arrangement agreement 
financial information included in this document this annual report on form k includes financial and other information for the years ended december  prior to may   we were still a wholly owned subsidiary of vista 
consistent with our past filings  the financial statements  related discussion and analysis and other financial information in this document were prepared as relates to the subsidiaries of vista that held nevada based mining properties and related assets that were transferred to allied nevada as part of the arrangement agreement 
in our filings prior to the completion of the arrangement agreement  we referred to these subsidiaries as vista gold corp

competition allied nevada competes with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold properties 
there is competition for the limited number of gold acquisition opportunities  some of which is with companies 
table of contents having substantially greater financial resources than allied nevada 
as a result  allied nevada may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices 
allied nevada also competes with other mining companies for skilled employees and from time to time certain production inputs have been in short supply 
when shortages of production supplies occur  this would rarely lead to serious issues for the operation  but would require us to either substitute with lower quality supplies or to ship these supplies from longer distances 
these substitutions and changes would therefore result in minor production inefficiencies or additional costs 
we have not experienced any material shortages in production inputs of this nature 
management of allied nevada believes that no single company has sufficient market power to affect the price or supply of gold in the world market 
allied nevada does not have any major customers for its gold production that would adversely affect the company should they fail

government regulation of mining related activities property interests and mining claims our exploration activities are conducted in the state of nevada 
mineral interests may be owned in nevada by a the united states  b the state itself  or c private parties 
where prospective mineral properties are owned by private parties  or by the state  some type of property acquisition agreement is necessary in order for allied nevada to explore or develop such property 
generally  these agreements take the form of long term mineral leases under which we acquire the right to explore and develop the property in exchange for periodic cash payments during the exploration and development phase and a royalty  usually expressed as a percentage of gross production or net profits derived from the leased properties if and when mines on the properties are brought into production 
other forms of acquisition agreements are exploration agreements coupled with options to purchase and joint venture agreements 
where prospective mineral properties are held by the united states  mineral rights may be acquired through the location of unpatented mineral claims upon unappropriated federal land 
if the statutory requirements for the location of a mining claim are met  the locator obtains a valid possessory right to develop and produce minerals from the claim 
the right can be freely transferred and  provided that the locator is able to prove the discovery of locatable minerals on the claims  is protected against appropriation by the government without just compensation 
the claim locator also acquires the right to obtain a patent or fee title to his claim from the federal government upon compliance with certain additional procedures note since october  the us bureau of land management blm has been prohibited by acts of congress from accepting any new mineral patent applications mining claims are subject to the same risk of defective title that is common to all real property interests 
additionally  mining claims are self initiated and self maintained and therefore  possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests 
it is impossible to ascertain the validity of 
table of contents unpatented mining claims solely from an examination of the public real estate records and  therefore  it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location and maintenance of a claim 
if the validity of a patented mining claim is challenged by the blm or the us forest service on the grounds that mineralization has not been demonstrated  the claimant has the burden of proving the present economic feasibility of mining minerals located thereon 
such a challenge might be raised when a patent application is submitted or when the government seeks to include the land in an area to be dedicated to another use 
reclamation we generally are required to mitigate long term environmental impacts by stabilizing  contouring  resloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed 
these reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans  which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
allied nevada s principal reclamation liability is at the hycroft mine 
at december   we have posted reclamation bonds totaling million 
these reclamation bonds are supported by an insurance backed financial assurance program and a surety bond 
please see note restricted cash to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
government regulation mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national  state and local laws and regulations in the united states  which govern prospecting  development  mining  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection of the environment  mine safety  hazardous substances and other matters 
we have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses  permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs 
we believe that allied nevada is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining  health  safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in nevada and the united states and in any other jurisdiction in which we will operate 
we are not aware of any current orders or directions relating to allied nevada with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations 
environmental regulation our gold projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment 
these laws are continually changing and  in general  are becoming more restrictive 
it is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment 
we believe that allied nevada s operations are and will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in nevada  where we operate currently  or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future  could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and or reclamation costs 
although we are unable to predict what additional legislation  if any  might be proposed or enacted  additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects 
during   and  there were no material environmental incidents or non compliance with any applicable environmental regulations on the properties now held by allied nevada 
allied nevada did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during   or item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this prospectus before deciding to invest or to continue holding your investment in our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us or 
table of contents otherwise associated with an investment in our common stock 
additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
we have attempted to identify the major factors under the heading risk factors that could cause differences between actual and planned or expected results  and we have included these material risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually happen  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in this case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
see forward looking statements above 
risks relating to our company we are at an early stage of production and have minimal operating history as an independent company 
our future revenues and profits are uncertain 
we are a production stage venture with minimal operating history as an independent company 
we were incorporated in september and commenced operations in may with properties and other mineral assets formerly held by vista and the pescios 
none of these properties is currently producing gold in commercial quantities and there can be no assurance that these properties  or others that may be acquired by us in the future  will produce gold in commercial quantities or otherwise generate operating earnings 
although our properties include the hycroft mine  operations at the hycroft mine were suspended in december  and the site was placed on a care and maintenance program 
our board of directors approved the reactivation of the hycroft open pit mine in september and we are now in the start up phase of operations 
even though mining activities at the hycroft mine have re commenced or if development activity on other properties is commenced  we may continue to incur losses beyond the period of commencement of such activity 
there is no certainty that we will produce revenue  operate profitably or provide a return on investment in the future 
if we are unable to generate revenues or profits  investors might not be able to realize returns on their investment in our common stock or keep from losing their investment 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
the reactivation of the hycroft open pit mine is subject to risks including delays in completion and we may be unable to achieve anticipated production volume or manage cost increases 
completion of the reactivation of the hycroft mine is subject to various factors  including the availability and performance of our engineering and construction contractors  suppliers and consultants and receipt and maintenance of required governmental approvals 
any delay in the performance of any one or more of the contractors  suppliers  consultants or other persons on which we depend  or to receive or maintain required governmental approvals  could delay or prevent the reactivation of the hycroft mine as currently planned 
there can be no assurance that amount of funds we raised in april will be sufficient to finance development activities and company operations through the start up phase  whether the resulting operations will achieve the anticipated production volume  or that the reactivation costs and ongoing operating costs associated with the development of the hycroft mine will not be higher than anticipated 
although most of our executive management team has experience in developing and operating mines  allied nevada  as a newly formed independent company  has never developed or operated a mine or managed a significant mine development project 
we cannot assure you that the reactivation of the hycroft mine will be completed at the cost and on the schedule predicted  or that gold grades and recoveries  production rates or anticipated capital or operating costs will be achieved 
although we believe that we have obtained sufficient funds to complete the reactivation of the hycroft mine  we cannot provide assurance of this 
furthermore  if the actual cost to complete the project is significantly 
table of contents higher than currently expected  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to cover these costs or that we will be able to obtain alternative sources of financing to cover these costs 
unexpected cost increases  reduced gold prices or the failure to obtain necessary additional financing on acceptable terms to complete the reactivation of the hycroft mine on a timely basis  or to achieve anticipated production capacity  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we may not achieve our production estimates 
we prepare estimates of future production for our operations 
we develop our estimates based on  among other things  mining experience  reserve estimates  assumptions regarding ground conditions and physical characteristics of ores such as hardness and presence or absence of certain metallurgical characteristics and estimated rates and costs of mining and processing 
in the past  our actual production from time to time has been lower than our production estimates and this may be the case in the future 
each of these factors also applies to future development properties not yet in production and to the hycroft mine 
in the case of mines we may develop in the future  we do not have the benefit of actual experience in our estimates  and there is a greater likelihood that the actual results will vary from the estimates 
in addition  development and expansion projects are subject to unexpected construction and start up problems and delays 
we cannot be certain that our acquisition  exploration and evaluation activities will be commercially successful 
although we have recently commenced activities in connection with our reactivation of the hycroft mine  we currently have no properties that produce gold in commercial quantities 
substantial expenditures are required to acquire existing gold properties  to establish ore reserves through drilling and analysis  to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal from the ore and  in the case of new properties  to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining 
we cannot provide assurance that any gold reserves or mineralized material acquired or discovered will be in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for development can be obtained on a timely basis 
whether income will result from the hycroft mine depends on the successful re establishment of mining operations 
factors including costs  actual mineralization  consistency and reliability of ore grades and commodity prices affect successful project development 
the reactivation and efficient operation of processing facilities  the existence of competent operational management and prudent financial administration  as well as the availability and reliability of appropriately skilled and experienced consultants also can affect successful project development which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
the price of gold is subject to fluctuations  which could adversely affect the realizable value of our assets and potential future results of operations and cash flow 
our principal assets are gold reserves and mineralized material 
we intend to attempt to acquire additional properties containing gold reserves and mineralized material 
the price that we pay to acquire these properties will be  in large part  influenced by the price of gold at the time of the acquisition 
our potential future revenues are expected to be  in large part  derived from the mining and sale of gold from these properties or from the outright sale or joint venture of some of these properties 
the value of these gold reserves and mineralized material  and the value of any potential gold production therefrom  will vary in proportion to variations in gold prices 
the price of gold has fluctuated widely  and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control  including  but not limited to  international  economic and political trends  expectations of inflation  currency exchange fluctuations  central bank activities  interest rates  global or regional consumption patterns and speculative activities 
the effect of these factors on the price of gold  and therefore the economic viability of any of our projects  cannot accurately be predicted 
any drop in the price of gold would adversely affect our asset values  cash flows  potential revenues and profits 

table of contents mining exploration  development and operating activities are inherently hazardous 
mineral exploration involves many risks that even a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome 
operations in which we have direct or indirect interests will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration  development and production of gold and other metals  any of which could result in work stoppages  damage to property and possible environmental damage 
the nature of these risks is such that liabilities might exceed any liability insurance policy limits 
it is also possible that the liabilities and hazards might not be insurable  or  that we could elect not to insure allied nevada against such liabilities due to high premium costs or other reasons  in which event  we could incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
reserve calculations are estimates only  subject to uncertainty due to factors including metal prices  inherent variability of the ore and recoverability of metal in the mining process 
there is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves and corresponding grades dedicated to future production 
until reserves are actually mined and processed  the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only 
in addition  the quantity of reserves and ore may vary depending on metal prices 
any material change in the quantity of reserves  mineralization  grade or stripping ratio may affect the economic viability of our properties 
in addition  there can be no assurance that gold recoveries or other metal recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on site conditions or during production 
we may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms 
the exploration and development of our development properties will require significant capital investment to achieve commercial production 
we may have to raise additional funds from external sources in order to maintain and advance our existing property positions and to acquire new gold projects 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms and  if additional financing is not available to us  we may have to substantially reduce or cease operations 
we face intense competition in the mining industry 
the mining industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases 
as a result of this competition  some of which is with large established mining companies with substantial capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than ours  we may be unable to acquire additional attractive mining claims or financing on terms we consider acceptable 
this  in turn  may adversely affect our financial condition and our future results of operations 
we also compete with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees 
if we are unable to successfully attract and retain qualified employees  our exploration and development programs may be slowed down or suspended 
in addition  we compete with other gold companies for capital 
if we are unable to raise sufficient capital  our exploration and development programs may be jeopardized or we may not be able to acquire  develop or operate gold projects 
we will depend on outside sources to place our mineral deposit properties into production 
our ability to place our properties into production will be dependent upon using the services of appropriately experienced personnel or contractors and purchasing additional equipment  or entering into agreements with other major resource companies that can provide such expertise or equipment 
there can be no assurance that we will have available to us the necessary expertise or equipment when and if we place our mineral deposit properties into production 
if we are unable to successfully retain such expertise and equipment  our development and growth could be significantly curtailed 

table of contents our operations are subject to numerous governmental permits which are difficult to obtain and we may not be able to obtain or renew all of the permits we require  or such permits may not be timely obtained or renewed 
in the ordinary course of business we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for our operations  including operation and expansion of the hycroft mine 
obtaining or renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time consuming process involving costly undertakings by allied nevada 
the duration and success of our efforts to obtain and renew permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control including the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority 
we may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations  or the cost to obtain or renew permits may exceed our estimates 
failure to comply with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations may result in injunctions  fines  suspension or revocation or permits and other penalties 
there can be no assurance that we have been or will at all times be in full compliance with all such laws and regulations and with our environmental and health and safety permits or that we have all required permits 
the costs and delays associated with compliance with these laws  regulations and permits and with the permitting process could stop us from proceeding with the operation or development of the hycroft mine or increase the costs of development or production and may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our exploration and development operations are subject to environmental regulations  which could result in the incurrence of additional costs and operational delays 
all phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation 
environmental legislation is evolving in some jurisdictions in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement  increased fines and penalties for non compliance  more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors and employees 
there is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation  if any  will not adversely affect our projects 
we will be subject to environmental regulations with respect to our properties in nevada  under applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
production at our hycroft mine involves the use of sodium cyanide which is a toxic material 
should sodium cyanide leak or otherwise be discharged from the containment system then allied may become subject to liability for cleanup work that may not be insured 
while appropriate steps will be taken to prevent discharges of pollutants into the ground water and the environment  allied nevada may become subject to liability for hazards that it may not be insured against 
our properties in nevada occupy private and public lands 
the public lands include unpatented mining claims on lands administered by the blm nevada state office 
these claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the us federal government and the state of nevada 
us federal laws under the us resource conservation and recovery act  mining companies may incur costs for generating  transporting  treating  storing  or disposing of hazardous waste  as well as for closure and post closure maintenance once they have completed mining activities on a property 
our mining operations may produce air emissions  including fugitive dust and other air pollutants  from stationary equipment  storage facilities  and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment which are subject to review  monitoring and or control requirements under the federal clean air act and state air quality laws 
permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or create additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the rules 
the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla imposes strict joint and several liability on parties associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances 
the groups who could be found liable include  among others  the current owners and operators of facilities which release hazardous substances into the environment and past owners and operators of 
table of contents properties who owned such properties at the time the disposal of the hazardous substances occurred 
this liability could include the cost of removal or remediation of the release and damages for injury to the surrounding property 
we cannot predict the potential for future cercla liability with respect to our properties 
nevada laws at the state level  mining operations in nevada are also regulated by the nevada department of conservation and natural resources  division of environmental protection 
nevada state law requires the hycroft mine to hold nevada water pollution control permits  which dictate operating controls and closure and post closure requirements directed at protecting surface and ground water 
in addition  we are required to hold nevada reclamation permits required under nrs a 
through a 
these permits mandate concurrent and post mining reclamation of mines and require the posting of reclamation bonds sufficient to guarantee the cost of mine reclamation 
other nevada regulations govern operating and design standards for the construction and operation of any source of air contamination and landfill operations 
any changes to these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations by  for example  required changes to operating constraints  technical criteria  fees or surety requirements 
legislation has been proposed that would significantly affect the mining industry 
members of the us congress have repeatedly introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the mining law of if enacted  such legislation could change the cost of holding unpatented mining claims and could significantly impact our ability to develop mineralized material on unpatented mining claims 
such bills have proposed  among other things  to either eliminate or greatly limit the right to a mineral patent and to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims 
although it is impossible to predict at this point what any legislated royalties might be  enactment could adversely affect the potential for development of such mining claims and the economics of existing operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims 
passage of such legislation could adversely affect our financial performance 
increased costs could affect our financial condition 
we anticipate that costs at the hycroft mine  as well as other properties that we may explore or develop  will frequently be subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors  such as changing ore grade  metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body 
in addition  costs are affected by the price of commodities such as fuel and electricity 
such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements  including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable 
a material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability 
the global financial crisis may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
the continued credit crisis and related instability in the global financial system has had  and may continue to have  an impact on our business and our financial condition 
we may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve 
our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access such markets  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
the credit crisis could have an impact on any potential lenders or on our customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 
our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the domestic capital markets and the economy generally 
the stress experienced by domestic capital markets that began in the second half of has continued and substantially increased during the third quarter of recently  concerns over inflation  energy 
table of contents costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil and gas prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic slowdown and fears of a possible recession 
in addition  the fixed income markets are experiencing a period of extreme volatility which has negatively impacted market liquidity conditions 
initially  the concerns on the part of market participants were focused on the subprime segment of the mortgage backed securities market 
however  these concerns have since expanded to include a broad range of mortgage and asset backed and other fixed income securities  including those rated investment grade  the us and international credit and interbank money markets generally  and a wide range of financial institutions and markets  asset classes and sectors 
as a result  capital markets have experienced decreased liquidity  increased price volatility  credit downgrade events  and increased probabilities of default 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us because our liquidity and ability to fund our capital expenditures is dependent in part upon our bank borrowings and access to the public capital markets 
our revenues are likely to decline in such circumstances 
in addition  in the event of extreme prolonged market events  such as the global credit crisis  we could incur significant losses 
even in the absence of a market downturn  we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility 
factors such as business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and  ultimately  the profitability of our business 
in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment  lower corporate earnings and lower business investment  our operations could be negatively impacted 
purchasers of our gold production may delay or be unable to make timely payments to us 
adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the current mortgage crisis has also raised the possibility of future legislative and regulatory actions in addition to the recent enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa that could further impact our business 
we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur  or what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that actions of the us government  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will achieve the intended effect 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   president bush signed the eesa into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets 
the federal government  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis 
there can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility currently being experienced 
such continued volatility could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  or the trading price of our common stock 
a shortage of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our mining exploration and development operations 
the shortage of such supplies  equipment and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and therefore limit or increase the cost of production 
we are dependent on third parties that are responsible for exploration and development on some of our properties 
our success may be dependent on the efforts and expertise of third parties with whom we have contracted 
a number of the properties in which allied nevada holds interests are subject to third party contracts 
third parties are responsible for exploration and discovery with respect to certain of allied nevada s mineral 
table of contents properties and related assets 
such third parties are not under allied nevada s control or direction 
we are dependent on such third parties for accurate information with respect to our mining properties and related assets and the progress and development of such properties and assets 
the third parties control the time of exploration and  if warranted  the development of certain of allied nevada s mining properties and related assets 
a third party may be in default of its agreement with allied nevada  without our knowledge  which may put the property and related assets at risk 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  we may be unable to establish and develop our business 
our development in the future will be highly dependent on the efforts of key management employees  namely  robert buchan  our executive chairman  scott caldwell  our president and chief executive officer  hal kirby  our vice president and chief financial officer  mike doyle  our vice president of technical services  and other key employees that we hire in the future 
although we have entered into employment agreements with key employees as determined by allied nevada  we do not have and currently have no plans to obtain key man insurance with respect to any of our key employees 
as well  we will need to recruit and retain other qualified managerial and technical employees to build and maintain our operations 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain such persons  our development and growth could be significantly curtailed 
our lack of operating experience may cause us difficulty in managing our growth 
we commenced operations on may  as an independent entity and are establishing operating procedures for evaluating  acquiring and developing properties  and negotiating  establishing and maintaining strategic relationships 
our ability to manage our growth  if any  will require us to improve and expand our management and our operational and financial systems and controls 
if our management is unable to manage growth effectively  our business and financial condition would be materially harmed 
in addition  if rapid growth occurs  it may strain our operational  managerial and financial resources 
there may be challenges to our title to our mineral properties 
our us mineral properties consist of private mineral rights  leases covering state and private lands  leases of patented mining claims  and unpatented mining claims 
many of our mining properties in the us are unpatented mining claims to which we have only possessory title 
because title to unpatented mining claims is subject to inherent uncertainties  it is difficult to determine conclusively ownership of such claims 
these uncertainties relate to such things as sufficiency of mineral discovery  proper posting and marking of boundaries and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from descriptions of record 
since a substantial portion of all mineral exploration  development and mining in the us now occurs on unpatented mining claims  this uncertainty is inherent in the mining industry 
the present status of our unpatented mining claims located on public lands allows us the exclusive right to mine and remove valuable minerals  such as precious and base metals 
we also are allowed to use the surface of the land solely for purposes related to mining and processing the mineral bearing ores 
however  legal ownership of the land remains with the us we remain at risk that the mining claims may be forfeited either to the us or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with statutory requirements 
there may be challenges to title to the mineral properties in which we hold a material interest 
if there are title defects with respect to any properties  we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property 
also  in any such case  the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert our management s time from ongoing exploration and development programs 

table of contents our principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval  which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the board of directors  possibly conflicting with the interests of our other stockholders 
carl and janet pescio own approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of allied nevada 
in addition to being a major stockholder  mr 
pescio is a director of allied nevada 
because of the pescios major shareholding and mr 
pescio s position on the allied nevada board  the pescios could exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise control our business 
this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or entrenching our management or the board of directors  which could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and  consequently  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
some of our directors may have conflicts of interest as a result of their involvement with other natural resource companies 
some of our directors are directors or officers of other natural resource or mining related companies  or may be involved in related pursuits that could present conflicts of interest with their roles at allied nevada 
these associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time 
in the event that any such conflict of interest arises  a director who has such a conflict is required to disclose the conflict to a meeting of the directors of the company in question and to abstain from voting for or against approval of any matter in which such director may have a conflict 
in appropriate cases  we will establish a special committee of independent directors to review a matter in which several directors  or management  may have a conflict 
risks relating to our common stock our common stock has limited trading history and the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 
our common stock began trading in may and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for allied nevada common stock will be sustained in the future 
we cannot predict the prices at which allied nevada common stock may trade 
the market price of the common stock may fluctuate widely  depending upon many factors  some of which may be beyond the control of allied nevada including  but not limited to  fluctuations in the price of gold  announcements by us or competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions  and overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions 
stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
investors may be unable to accurately value our common stock 
investors often value companies based on the stock prices and results of operations of other comparable companies 
currently  we do not believe another public gold exploration company exists that is directly comparable to our size and scale 
further  the pescios assets had previously been privately held 
prospective investors  therefore  have limited historical information about certain of the properties held by allied nevada upon which to base an evaluation of allied nevada s performance and prospects and an investment in our common stock 
as such  investors may find it difficult to accurately value our common stock 
future sales of our common stock in the public or private markets could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity related securities in the public or private markets  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
as of march    shares of our common stock were outstanding 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of our common stock  or the availability of our shares for future sale  will have on the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents allied nevada may be considered a foreign investment entity which may have adverse canadian tax consequences for its canadian investors 
bill c which received second reading in the canadian senate on december   contains provisions that relate to the income tax treatment of investments by canadian residents in non resident entities that constitute foreign investment entities fies applicable for taxation years commencing after the fie proposals 
bill c died as a result of the prorogation of the canadian parliament on december  accordingly  bill c will need to be reintroduced as a new bill in the canadian house of commons which is expected to occur during the next session of the canadian house of commons 
the fie proposals are exceedingly complex and their application is not clear in certain circumstances 
in general terms  the fie proposals would apply to require a holder that holds a participating interest that is not an exempt interest in a fie to include in income for each taxation year an amount of income or gains computed in accordance with the fie proposals  regardless of whether the holder actually receives any income or realizes any gains 
for purposes of the fie proposals  the allied nevada shares would constitute a participating interest in the company 
if the company is a fie  a holder of an allied nevada share  unless the share is an exempt interest to such holder  would be required to include in income for that year an amount determined  in general terms  by applying a prescribed interest rate to the holder s designated cost of the allied nevada share at the end of each month ending in the holder s taxation year  unless the holder makes a valid election to use either the mark to market method or the accrual method 
in certain limited circumstances  where a holder of allied nevada shares makes a valid election to use the market to market method  such holder will be required to include in income for that year any gains or losses accrued on the allied nevada shares for the year 
where a holder of allied nevada shares makes a valid election to use the accrual method  such holder will be required to include in income for that year the holder s proportionate share of allied nevada s income or loss for the year calculated using canadian tax rules 
the holder must include in income the amount so determined notwithstanding that the holder may not have received any corresponding cash distribution from the company 
a prospective holder of allied nevada shares should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of the fie proposals to such holder 
to the extent that changes are made to the specific legislation finally implementing the fie proposals such changes could result in the canadian federal income tax considerations described herein being materially different in certain respects 
we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future 
as a result  you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases 
our board of directors retains the discretion to change this policy

item properties we classify our mineral properties into two categories operating properties and other exploration properties 
operating properties are properties on which the company operates a producing mine 
we currently have one operating property  namely the hycroft open pit mine as discussed below 
please see below for information about our operating properties and exploration properties 
other than the hycroft open pit mine  we cannot be certain that any mineral deposits will be discovered in sufficient quantities and grade to justify commercial operations 
whether a mineral deposit will be commercially 
table of contents viable depends on a number of factors  including the particular attributes of the deposit  metal prices  which are highly cyclical  the cost to extract and process the mineralized material  and government regulations and permitting requirements 
we may be unable to upgrade our mineralized material to proven and probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations and we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to develop our properties 
estimates of reserves and mineralization herein are subject to the effect of changes in metal prices  and to the risks inherent in mining and processing operations 
operating properties technical report the information that follows relating to the hycroft open pit mine other than the information under the heading hycroft exploration drilling program is derived from  and in some instances is an extract from  the technical report dated october  the hycroft technical report authored by scott wilson  cpg of scott e

hycroft open pit mine logo 
table of contents we currently have one operating property  the hycroft open pit mine  which we also refer to as the hycroft mine in this document 
this mine and related facilities are located miles west of winnemucca  nevada 
winnemucca population  is a commercial community on interstate  miles northeast of reno  nevada 
the town is served by a transcontinental railroad and has a small airport 
access to the hycroft mine from winnemucca  nevada is by means of state road no 
jungo road  a good quality  unpaved road 
access is also possible from imlay and from lovelock by unpaved roads intersecting interstate the majority of our employees live in the winnemucca area 
the mine is situated on the eastern edge of the black rock desert and on the western flank of the kamma mountains between winnemucca and gerlach  nevada 
there are no streams  rivers  or major lakes in the general area 
elevations in the mine area range between  and  ft above sea level 
the company holds patented and  unpatented mining claims that constitute our hycroft mine operating property 
the total acreage covered by these claims is approximately  acres with approximately  acres related to the patented claims 
the details of these claims and the holding requirements are discussed in greater detail in the geology and ore reserve section that follows 
the climate of the region is arid  with precipitation averaging inches per year 
temperatures during the summer range from f to greater than f and winter temperatures range from f to f 
there is strong surface heating during the day and rapid nighttime cooling because of the dry air 
this  results in wide ranges in daily temperatures 
the hycroft mine consists of multiple open pit mines  associated waste dumps and two heap leach pads 
the hycroft mine was formally known as the crofoot lewis open pit mine 
mining began in the area in with a small heap leaching operation known as the lewis mine 
lewis mine production was followed by production from the crofoot property in the bay  south central  boneyard  gap and cut pits along the central fault  and finally the north end of the brimstone pit and continued until it was placed on a care and maintenance program in december due to low gold prices 
the lewis mine was acquired by vista in early from fw lewis  inc and the crofoot mine was acquired by vista in april the leasehold interest in the lewis property and a nsr royalty on gold and a nsr on silver was purchased from fw lewis  inc by vista on december  in consideration of the payment of million 
the crofoot property was originally held under two leases and is now owned by allied nevada subject to a net profits interest retained by the former owners 
the lease agreements include for the payment of advance royalty payments of million in any year where mining occurs on the crofoot claims 
all advance royalty payments are credited against the future payments under the net profits royalty 
the hycroft mine produced over one million ounces of gold from the commencement of mining operations in  until the operations were placed on a care and maintenance program  as a result of low gold prices in december of gold production from the leaching and rinsing of the heap leach pads  continued in and in   and  the amount of gold recovered was not material 
geology the hycroft open pit mine is located on the western flank of the kamma mountains 
the deposit is hosted in a volcanic eruptive breccia and conglomerates associated with the tertiary kamma mountain volcanics 
the volcanics are mainly acidic to intermediate tuffs  flows and coarse volcaniclastic rocks 
fragments of these units dominate the clasts in the eruptive breccia 
volcanic rocks have been block faulted by dominant north trending structures  which have affected the distribution of alteration and mineralization 
the central fault and east fault control the distribution of mineralization and subsequent oxidation 
a post mineral range front fault separates the orebody from the adjacent pleistocene lahontan lake sediments in the black rock desert 

table of contents the known gold mineralization within the crofoot and lewis properties extends for a distance of three miles in a north south direction by miles in an east west direction 
mineralization extends to a depth of less than feet in the outcropping to near outcropping portion of the deposit on the northwest side to over  feet in the brimstone deposit in the east 
not all the mineralization is oxidized and the depth of oxide ore varies considerably over the area of mineralization 
we currently have patented claims that comprise approximately  acres and  unpatented claims that comprise approximately  acres 
combining the patented and unpatented claims  our claims total approximately  acres 
this claim package was acquired by the company in a series of transactions the crofoot property and approximately  acres of claims were acquired by vista in the crofoot property  originally held under lease  is owned by hycroft resources development  inc subject to a net profits interest retained by the former owners 
the fw lewis property and approximately  acres of claims were acquired by vista in early in  approximately  acres of additional claims were staked by vista 
these claims were around or contiguous to the original crofoot and fw lewis claims 
in  we staked approximately  acres of additional claims contiguous to or around the existing hycroft claims 
our hycroft patented claims occupy private lands and our unpatented claims occupy public lands 
the public lands include unpatented mining claims on lands administered by the blm 
these claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the us federal government and the state of nevada 
to maintain the patented claims in good standing  we must pay the annual property tax payments to the county in which the claims are held 
to maintain the unpatented claims in good standing  we must file a notice of intent to maintain the claims and pay the annual mineral claim filing fees to the state and the blm 
ore reserves wilson consulting issued the hycroft technical report on october   in accordance with ni guidelines 
the report and verification of the data employed in the report was undertaken under the supervision of mr 
scott wilson  cpg  a qualified person under ni independent of allied nevada 
wilson consulting  inc prepared this technical report of the hycroft mine at our request 
this report was intended to provide a technical summary of the hycroft mine gold and silver resource and reserves for allied nevada 
this technical report is written in compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the canadian securities administrators national instrument  companion policy cp  and form f and reconciled as appropriate to conform to sec industry guide prior to this report  wilson consulting had authored a technical report pertaining to the hycroft mine dated june  the technical information contained in the october  technical report reflects material changes that occurred since the june report 
wilson consulting evaluated allied nevada s current economic forecasts and used these criteria to report the proven and probable mineral reserves for the hycroft project 
mining sequences were determined and mining plans were developed 
wilson consulting believed that there have been sufficient evaluations of mining  processing  economic and environmental factors to support the determination of proven and probable reserves for the hycroft mine 
wilson consulting  utilizing the guidelines prescribed by ni and sec industry guide  determined proven and probable mineral reserves within a pit design that is economic using a cutoff grade of ounces per ton of gold 
in compliance with sec industry guide  these reported reserves were determined to be 
table of contents economic using a year historical gold price average of gold recovery utilizing a run of mine heap leach process is estimated to be for both proven and probable reserves 
category tons oz au ton contained ounces au total waste tons strip ratio s s gold proven reserves probable reserves proven and probable reserves other mineralized material silver other mineralized materials mine operations the mining of our current proven and probable ore reserves in the brimstone pit and cut pit will be conducted by open pit methods using ton haul trucks  yard wheel loaders and dml blast hole drills 
mining in the brimstone pit has been designed with five mining phases and the cut pit will be mined in one single sequence 
our current mine plans are based upon an annual mining rate of million tons of material per year using foot lifts and three lifts per catch bench 
we are currently in the first phase of five phases of mining at the brimstone pit 
this first phase included the initial development of the mine pre production mining of waste  the waste mining stage when we mine a greater proportion of waste than ore and then the ore mining stage where we mine a greater proportion of ore than waste 
the initial development of the brimstone open pit involved the mining of million tons of waste and was completed in the third quarter of we are currently in the waste mining stage which involves the mining of a greater proportion of waste than ore a higher strip ratio in order to allow for more efficient ore release in future periods 
we expect to return to lower strip ratios in early as we complete the waste mining stage of phase and proceed to the ore mining stage 
we are currently using a contract mining company to expedite ore production in the early stages of mining 
we will continually evaluate the economics of continuing the use of the contract miner in the future 
we currently plan to haul and place the ore production from the mine on the brimstone pad system as run of mine material 
the brimstone pad system is currently comprised of the previously operated brimstone leach pad and the million square foot leach pad expansion we completed in this leach pad system has sufficient capacity to handle our ore placement requirements for most of we plan to continually expand this leach pad system in and future years as production requires 
all ore grade material placed on the leach pad will be cross ripped to enhance permeability 
a network of solution drip lines will be positioned and the run of mine material will be leached with a cyanide solution for a period of to days before another ft high lift of ore is placed on top of the existing lift 
return solution from the pad containing the precious metals is directed to the pregnant solution pond 
gold will be removed from pregnant solutions using a carbon in leach solution process cil process and at the brimstone plant using the merrill crowe zinc precipitation gold recovery process merrill crowe process 
the carbon from the cil process will be transported to a third party for processing to recover the precious metals from the carbon and produce a dor containing gold and silver 
dor containing gold and silver will be produced at the hycroft mine from the merrill crowe process 
based on previous operating experience of the gold placed on the pad is expected to be recovered in the plant 
we are currently in the startup phase of the brimstone pit and the brimstone leach pad system 
as mentioned above  ore deliveries from the mine are currently lower than we expect to experience once we attain sustainable ore release in the second quarter of the startup phase of a leach pad system also results in a steady increase in production as more ore is placed under leach 
as a result  based on our current life of mine production plan  we expect the gold production from the hycroft mine to gradually increase over the startup phase until the middle of when we expect to reach normal production levels of approximately  ounces of gold per year 

table of contents the dor containing gold and silver will then be shipped to a contract refinery to be further processed into gold and silver bullion 
the contained gold and silver is typically sold in either a dor or bullion form 
when sold in a dor format  the contained gold and silver will be sold to a metals merchant who will ultimately receive the delivery of bullion from the refinery 
alternatively  we can sell the gold and silver bullions once the refining process has been completed 
during  we expect to evaluate a number of alternatives to increase the annual gold production from the hycroft mine 
the alternatives we are considering include the following increasing mining rates in order to increase annual gold production 
initial studies show that the mine plan and process facilities can accommodate a expansion to mining rates 
this increased mining rate would be accomplished by the use of a mining contractor or the purchase of additional mining equipment 
a increase to the total mining rate would increase ore production by approximately million tons per annum and would increase annual gold production by   ounces per year 
operating costs would be similar to those presently experienced at the mine 
by increasing the grade of gold and silver in the pregnant solution  the operating efficiencies of the merrill crowe plant and the carbon in leach cil plant will improve 
the operating plan includes the expansion of ponds  pumps  piping and leach pads to allow for stacking of the pregnant solution increasing the grade of the pregnant solution 
the stacking of pregnant solution will begin in the third quarter of the benefits of this optimization program will not be realized until the third expansion alternative presently being evaluated is to take advantage of the additional gold and silver recovery that may be obtained by crushing the ore as opposed to placing run of mine ore on the pad 
metallurgical testing is currently in progress to determine the increase in gold and silver recovery that would result from crushing the ore 
historic production data indicates that by crushing ore to approximately one inch in size that gold recovery could improve by approximately 
no historic data is available for the effect of crushing on silver recovery 
the metallurgical test work and associated economic evaluations will be completed in the third quarter of the potential benefits of this expansion would not be seen until additionally  we expect to continue our oxide exploration drilling program in and future years to identify additional proven and probable oxide reserves that could ultimately increase the total amount of gold mined at the hycroft mine 
infrastructure  equipment and services at december   the mining operations consisted of the crofoot  brimstone  and boneyard open pits and associated waste dumps 
vista had placed these pits on a care and maintenance program in due to low gold prices 
although these pits had survived the extended shutdown relatively well  a number of steps were taken in order to continue production at the brimstone open pit in at december   the site processing facilities included the crofoot and brimstone leach pads  the crofoot and brimstone merrill crowe zinc precipitation plant  and the crofoot refinery 
the leach pads and process plants also included the associated pumps  piping  and other related equipment 
the following is a discussion of the condition of these processing facilities and the work completed in to repair  refurbish  or replace them as necessary we inspected the brimstone leach pad system and made the necessary repairs and improvements to reactivate it from the care and maintenance program that it had been on since the leach pad system had been maintained in good condition but required the rebuild of a number of pumps  the inspection of process ponds  the replacement of netting on the process ponds  and the inspection of process piping 

table of contents construction of the refinery included a new building  retort  furnace  ventilation system  safe  crane and scrubber  and bag house for the retort and furnace 
the mine completed the design and expansion of million square feet of additional pad space for the brimstone pad 
the expansion is the first phase of several planned pad expansion phases designed to accommodate the oxide ore reserve at hycroft 
the pad is being designed and constructed in cells to allow for optimum solution control and efficient pond reclamation 
the brimstone plant was in good shape requiring a minimum amount of repair 
the crofoot plant is not currently operational and would required significant work to put it into production 
the plant would have to be rebuilt as would the process ponds and pumps 
the nevada division of environmental protection ndep has not renewed the water pollution control permit for the crofoot plant operations  which would then require some additional regulatory work 
the plant is not currently scheduled for use 
the site receives line current provided by nvenergy off the northwestern power grid 
with the cooperation of the power provider  we inspected the substations  power lines and transformers and repaired and replaced any necessary components 
we currently have adequate water rights to process the planned ore 
we have rehabilitated the primary process water well and fresh water well and have developed a new back up process water well 
many of the important site ancillary buildings that had been constructed during the previous period of operations continue to be in relatively good condition despite having been placed on a care and maintenance program 
these ancillary buildings included the warehouse  the main office  the mobile maintenance shop  the light vehicle maintenance shop  the engineering building  and the assay lab 
during  the following steps were taken to repair and replace these buildings as necessary the administrative building was demolished and a new metal frame office building was constructed 
due to the purchase of a larger haul trucks than had been previously used at the mine  modifications to the maintenance building to allow the haul trucks to enter the doors were completed 
the assay lab and equipment was inspected and relative minor repairs to the building and purchases of modern technology were required to return the assay lab to acceptable operating standards 
at december   we had a limited amount of operational equipment at the hycroft mine 
most of the equipment that existed at that time had been ancillary pieces of equipment or production equipment that had little or no resale value when vista placed the mine on a care and maintenance program in during  we completed the following activities to acquire production equipment and to rehabilitate existing equipment in march  we purchased a used mining fleet consisting of five ton haul trucks  two yard wheel loaders  two blast hole drills and various pieces of support equipment 
the fleet was disassembled and shipped to the hycroft mine in the second quarter of during  we completed the component rebuilds to return this equipment to full operating condition 
we purchased additional production and ancillary equipment as required by the hycroft development program 
we acquired two production drills and a komatsu dozer under capital leases and purchased the ancillary equipment with cash 
hycroft mine exploration allied nevada  as of year end  has drilled a total of holes  for combined total of  feet  at the hycroft project 
holes  for combined total of  feet of drilling  have been directed towards the oxide reserve expansion program 
a combined total of  feet have been drilled to assess the metallurgy of material 
table of contents stacked on the crofoot leach pad 
a combined total of  feet have been drilled to condemn the region of the expanded brimstone leach pad region 
the remaining drilling holes has targeted both near surface oxidation mineralization  plus sulfide mineralization at depth 
much of this drilling has been wide spaced approximately feet between drill holes  to an average depth of  feet 
drill targets tested include the brimstone  central  bay area and silver camel zones  plus testing of a geophysical anomaly to the south of brimstone vortex 
material from all holes has been assayed using a fire assay procedure for both gold and silver content by one of three independent laboratories 
management intends to continue exploration drilling on the sulfide system in we plan to conduct metallurgical testing and additional engineering work in we intend to complete a pre feasibility study evaluating the economic viability of the sulfide project and anticipate completion of the study in the analysis of the current drill results and historical geological information suggests that gold and silver mineralization is hosted along north south trending zones of approximately  feet in length 
these zones are partially defined laterally by post mineral faults 
the following individual zones  from west to east  currently recognized are camel  cove  central  boneyard  albert  fire  brimstone  and vortex 
the expanded program is also planned to include further exploration of the fire  albert  boneyard  cove and camel zones 
there has been historic mine production from the cove  central and brimstone zones 
the other zones have been defined by historic drill holes and surface mapping 
upon completion of a drill hole  the hole is surveyed and then plugged 
management of the drill program  sample collection and assay program is being carried out by allied nevada 
qualified independent consultants have reviewed all aspects of the exploration program and are expected to conduct regular reviews of the ongoing exploration program 
any expansion of the hycroft mine necessary to exploit any additional reserves that may be established through our hycroft exploration drilling program that are not located within our current mine plan  will require us to obtain all permits  approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in nevada 
exploration properties exploration properties are both those properties where we retain a significant controlling interest or joint venture and where there has been sufficient drilling and analysis completed to identify and report reserves or other mineralized material and more than earlier stage exploration properties 
allied nevada currently has six properties on which mineralized material has been identified maverick springs a joint venture with silver standard  mountain view  hasbrouck  three hills  wildcat and pony creek elliot dome 
none of these properties currently have proven or probable reserves as defined by industry guide additionally  with the operation of the hycroft mine  the properties are important to us  but are not material in the meaning associated with industry guide we are currently evaluating these six properties to determine how to best advance these projects by increasing the identified mineral resources  improving the quality of these mineral resources  or advancing the project to a development decision

to acquire the interest in maverick springs  vista paid cash of  and issued  equity units to newmont  each unit comprised of one vista share and one two year vista warrant 
newmont retained a nsr  and on october   vista issued to newmont  vista shares and  vista warrants 
all of the foregoing vista warrants expired unexercised 
in addition  pursuant to acquisition agreement terms vista completed  feet of drilling as of october   and was required to complete an additional  feet of drilling before october   such drilling was completed in august allied nevada may terminate this agreement at any time 
after october   newmont had a one time right to acquire a interest in the maverick springs project  by paying to allied nevada twice the amount that allied nevada and  historically vista  have spent on the project  including acquisition costs 
in the event that newmont exercises this right  newmont would relinquish its nsr 
this one time right expired days after receipt of data on the property from allied nevada  which data was required to be delivered within days of october  in january  newmont informed vista that it would not be exercising this right 
maverick springs is subject to a lease agreement  between newmont and artemis exploration company 
the lease was entered into on october   and the key terms include payment of advance minimum royalties of  on october  this has been paid and advance minimum royalties of  on october  this has been paid   on october  this has been paid and each year thereafter while the agreement is in effect  work commitments of  feet of exploration drilling  on or before october in each of extended by agreement to november   and these commitments have been met  a preliminary economic evaluation to be conducted by october  which was extended to april  this has been completed  and a net smelter returns royalty based on a sliding scale ranging from to  depending on gold and silver prices at the time of production 
on june   vista entered into an agreement granting silver standard resources inc silver standard an option to acquire its interest in the silver mineralized material hosted in the maverick springs project 
allied nevada  as successor to vista  will retain its interest in the gold mineralized material 
the agreement with ssri is subject to the terms of the newmont purchase agreement 
under the agreement  silver standard was to pay million over four years  of which  was paid to vista in   in and  in  completing the million obligation 
since silver standard has satisfied the million obligation  all costs incurred for maverick springs are now being shared by the two corporations as stated below 
silver standard and vista formed a committee to jointly manage exploration of the maverick springs project 
allied nevada  as successor to vista  has a vote on the committee  and silver standard is the operator and has a vote 
since silver standard has completed its million in payments  future costs will be shared by silver standard and allied nevada on the same ratio as established for operation of the management committee allied nevada silver standard  subject to standard dilution provisions 
prior operators have conducted drilling on the maverick springs project 
in november  vista completed a hole reverse circulation drill program totaling  feet on the maverick springs project 
the program consisted of seven vertical reverse circulation holes  stepped out feet to  feet from previously identified mineralization 
all seven holes encountered flat lying mineralization  predominantly oxidized to depths of up to feet 
the program outlined continuous mineralization in a  foot by  foot area  immediately adjacent to known gold silver mineralization 
with additional in fill drilling  this newly outlined mineralization has the potential to significantly increase the mineralized material 
in october  vista completed a hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet  in october  vista completed a hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet and in august  vista completed a hole reverse circulation drill program totaling approximately  feet 
in the th quarter of  silver standard completed a hole program totaling  feet 
intercepts continue to indicate the potential for bulk mineable gold silver mineralization 

table of contents geology maverick springs can be classified as a carlin type or sediment carbonate hosted disseminated silver gold deposit 
sediment hosted deposits are common within northern nevada  although the systems are usually gold dominated with relatively minor amounts of silver 
silver and gold mineralization at maverick springs has been interpreted as a roughly antiformal or arch shaped zone with an axis that plunges shallowly to the south and seems to flatten to horizontal over the northern half of the deposit 
the limbs of the arch dip shallowly to moderately at o to the east and west 
overall  the mineralized zone is elongate in the north south direction with a length of over  feet  a width of up to  feet  and a thickness of commonly feet 
mineralization consists of micron sized silver and gold with related pyrite  stibnite and arsenic sulfides 
it is usually associated with intense fracturing and brecciation  with or without accompanying whole rock silicification or stockwork quartz 
alteration consists of pervasive decalcification  weak to intense silicification and weak alunitic argillization 
massive jasperoid is common in surface exposures and in drill core 
oxidation has affected all sulfides on surface and is pervasive to a depth of at least feet  intermittent to feet  and generally absent below  feet 
based on a third party technical study performed on behalf of vista  the maverick springs project contains approximately million tons of mineralized material with an average grade of ounces of gold per ton and ounce of silver per ton at a silver equivalent cut off grade of ounce of silver per ton 
mountain view the mountain view property is located in northwest nevada near the blackrock desert 
the property is approximately miles northwest of gerlach  nevada in washoe county  it straddles the boundary between the squaw valley and banjo topographic quadrangles 
the property currently consists of claims with a total area of approximately  acres 
vista s acquisition of the mountain view property was completed along with that of the maverick springs property  as described above 
to acquire the interest in the mountain view property  vista paid cash of  and issued  equity units  each unit comprised of one vista share and a two year vista warrant  to newmont capital  and newmont capital retains a nsr 
all of these vista warrants expired unexercised 
in addition  vista completed  feet of drilling before october   as required by the underlying agreement 
allied nevada may terminate this agreement at any time 
after october   newmont capital had a one time right to acquire a interest in the project  by paying to allied nevada twice the amount that allied nevada  and historically vista  have spent on the project  including acquisition costs 
in the event that newmont capital were to exercise this right  newmont capital would relinquish its nsr 
this one time right expired days after receipt of data on the property from allied nevada  which data was required to be delivered within days of october  in january  newmont capital informed vista that it would not be exercising this right 
newmont capital s interest in the mountain view property is subject to an underlying lease and two other royalty arrangements  the principal terms of which are the underlying lease grants a interest to newmont in all claims  with a few exceptions where a interest is granted  and the lessee may purchase the remaining interest in the claims for  at any time 
the lessee is obligated to purchase the remaining for  on achieving commercial production 
also  the lessee shall pay a nsr during production  with advance minimum payments of  per year 
advanced royalties are deductible from the net smelter returns royalty and cease upon purchase of the remaining interest of the underlying lease 
a nsr also applies to certain other claims 
prior operators have conducted drilling on the mountain view property 
vista completed a five hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet in november the results indicate the presence of a new zone of bulk mineralization approximately feet east of the known core of mineralization 
vista completed a five hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet in  and the results indicate potential bulk mineable gold mineralization and the down dip extension of higher grade gold mineralization 

table of contents geology the dominant rock types in the area are miocene volcanics and interbedded volcaniclastic sediments 
minor greenschist facies permo triassic strata occur to the northeast and a large body of granodiorite makes up the bulk of the granite range to the east and south 
the miocene lithologies consist of mafic tuffs  rhyolite tuffs and flows  volcaniclastic sediments and basalts 
these units are separated from the granite range to the east by a range front normal fault that dips steeply to the southwest 
the severance deposit is hosted by a unit known as the severance rhyolite that is sandwiched between the range front fault to the northeast and older tertiary tuffs  flows and volcaniclastic sediments to the southwest 
structure on the property is dominated by northwest and northeast trending faults 
major fault offsets occur along the range front fault system and these are offset by the northeast trending structures 
recent alluvium is offset by the range front faults 
based on a third party technical study performed on behalf of vista  the mountain view project contains approximately million tons of gold mineralized material with an average grade of ounces of gold per ton at a cut off grade of ounces of gold per ton 
hasbrouck the hasbrouck property is located in southwestern nevada about miles south southwest of the town of tonopah in esmeralda county  nevada  adjacent to us highway and approximately half way between reno and las vegas 
the property consists of patented lode mining claims and unpatented lode claims that cover an area of approximately  acres 
on may   vista executed a purchase agreement with newmont capital  which includes both the hasbrouck property and the three hills property  which lies approximately miles to the north northwest 
terms of the purchase included a  cash payment on signing and  or  at vista s discretion  the equivalent in vista shares one year after signing 
in june and july  vista issued to newmont capital an aggregate  vista shares at a deemed per share price of 
the value of the vista shares was based on the average nyse a f k a amex closing price of the vista shares over the ten trading day period ending one day before the first anniversary of the agreement 
newmont capital  at its option  will retain either a a nsr in each project together with the right to a  cash payment at the start of commercial production at either project and a further  cash payment if  after the start of commercial production  the gold price averages per ounce or more for any three month period  or b the right to acquire of either or both projects 
the latter right would be exercisable only after the later of four years or the time when allied nevada  and historically vista  have incurred aggregate expenditures of million to acquire  explore and hold the projects and would include newmont capital paying to allied nevada cash equaling of the expenditures made by allied nevada  and historically vista  on the related property 
in this event  newmont capital would become operator of a joint venture with allied nevada  and both parties would fund the project through to a production decision 
allied nevada s contribution to the joint venture during this period is capped at million  million of which newmont capital would finance for allied nevada and recover  with interest  exclusively from related project cash flows 
allied nevada would also grant newmont capital a right of first offer with respect to subsequent sale of the projects by allied nevada 
an additional nsr on the hasbrouck property is held by a private party 
geology the property is located on hasbrouck mountain  which is thought to lie along the western edge of a caldera 
the mountain is underlain by gently dipping ash flow  air fall and waterlain tuffs and volcaniclastic sediments of the miocene siebert formation 
several occurrences of chalcedonic sinter deposits occur near the summit of the 
table of contents mountain 
gold and silver mineralization in the hasbrouck deposit appears to have formed relatively close to the paleo surface in an epithermal  hot spring environment 
the mineralization is concentrated in the siebert formation  in units stratigraphically below the chalcedonic sinter deposits that are exposed near the top of hasbrouck mountain 
two zones of mineralization are presently defined 
the main zone includes the bulk of mineralization at hasbrouck  while the small south adit zone lies to feet to the south of the main zone 
a third party technical study was completed for vista in august and was updated in august the hasbrouck study was developed using data from  feet of drilling  principally comprised of reverse circulation holes totaling  feet and rotary drill holes totaling  feet 
the drilling database was compiled from work performed by fmc gold co  cordex syndicate and franco nevada inc between and based on this study  mineralized material above a cut off of ounces of gold per ton is million tons with an average grade of ounces of gold per ton and ounces of silver per ton 
three hills three hills is located in southwestern nevada about mile west of the town of tonopah in esmeralda county  nevada  and about miles northwest of the hasbrouck property described above 
three hills consists of unpatented lode claims totaling approximately acres 
on may   vista executed a purchase agreement with newmont capital  which included both the hasbrouck property and the three hills property 
the terms of this agreement are detailed under the hasbrouck description above 
geology three hills is located in the walker lane structural domain of the basin and range physiographic province 
it is in an area of structural disruption resulting from a series of orogenic events occurring in paleozoic  mesozoic and cenozoic times 
basin and range high angle normal faults control the mineralization at three hills  where they cut the siebert formation 
gold mineralization occurs in a zone of pervasive silicification and in the siebert formation and the upper to feet of the fraction tuff 
the contact between these two units contains consistently higher grades of gold and is more commonly argillized than silicified 
a third party technical study was completed for vista in august and was updated in august the three hills study included data from  feet of drilling  comprised of reverse circulation holes totaling  feet  air track and rotary holes totaling  feet and diamond drill holes totaling  feet 
the drilling was completed by echo bay mines ltd  eastfield resources  saga exploration and cordex syndicate between and based on this study  gold mineralized material above a cut off of ounces of gold per ton was million tons with an average grade of ounces of gold per ton 
wildcat wildcat is located about miles northwest of lovelock and miles south of the hycroft open pit mine in pershing county  nevada 
the project consists of unpatented claims and patented claims  comprising acres 
during september and october  vista concluded due diligence reviews and executed formal purchase agreements to acquire the wildcat project and the associated exploration data in three separate transactions 
on september   vista purchased unpatented mining claims from monex exploration  a partnership  for  on signing and  on august  on commencement of commercial production  allied nevada will make a one time production payment in the amount of  thirteen of the claims are subject to an underlying nsr  and the remaining claims are subject to an underlying nsr 

table of contents on october   vista purchased a interest in the vernal unpatented mining claim from david c 
mough and jody ahlquist mough for  on signing and  on october   for a total consideration of  on october   vista purchased four patented mining claims and exploration data from sagebrush exploration  inc sagebrush for  vista shares issued and delivered to sagebrush upon the closing of the transaction 
the four patented claims are subject to an underlying net smelter returns royalty of for gold production between  and  ounces  increasing to on production in excess of  ounces 
geology wildcat lies in the seven troughs range which is underlain by triassic and jurassic sedimentary rocks and has been intruded by cretaceous granodiorite 
volcanic domes and plugs of rhyolite  quartz latite  trachyte  and andesite have been emplaced by tertiary volcanism 
tertiary flows of pyroclastic debris  and vitrophyres of rhyolite  quartz latite  trachyte  and andesite composition blanket much of the area 
the property contains structurally controlled epithermal gold and silver mineralization identified in four areas hero tag  main  northeast and knob the four areas have generally similar geology and mineralization with precious metals mineralization spatially associated with the contact between granodiorite and overlying tuff 
gold mineralization occurs with low temperature silica  chalcedony and pyrite 
the main  northeast  and knob deposits appear to be part of the hero tag deposit  though structurally displaced 
the principal low grade zone that essentially encompassed all the mineralization is tabular and dips gently to the southeast 
there appear to be two main styles of mineralization based on mapping  sampling  and statistics 
there is a broad  low grade zone surrounding higher grade material 
the principal host is the tuff in which the low grade precious metal mineralization is represented by pervasive and intense silicification 
the underlying granodiorite also contains a low grade disseminated style of mineralization with higher grade silicified breccias occurring generally as stockwork within it 
generally  the granodiorite has higher grade and is not silicified 
any silicification is restricted to adjacent veins and veinlets  occasionally being discrete veins as were exploited historically  but also resulting in a large tonnage stockwork 
all of the tuff was altered by epithermal solutions  however  much of the granodiorite is unaltered 
high grade material includes multi episodic chalcedonic silica veins and breccias 
a third party technical study was completed for vista in november and was updated in august using data from one underground channel sample  reverse circulation drill holes and diamond drill holes totaling  feet  gold mineralized material above a cut off grade of ounces of gold per ton was estimated at million tons grading ounces of gold per ton and ounces of silver per ton

the pony creek property lies along the axis of a regional mesozoic anticline that parallels the crest of the pinyon range 
the project area is within a zone of convergence of two major structural trends which are the boundaries of a north south series of grabens and half grabens collectively referred to as the pinyon graben 
a series of tertiary felsic intrusives have been emplaced at various points along this structural zone 

table of contents the lithologies of the region include the allochthonous  eugeoclinal  siliceous western assemblage  the autochthonous  miogeoclinal  eastern carbonate assemblage and the mixed overlap assemblage 
the late devonian early mississippian roberts mountain thrust and the post pinyon anticline  mesozoic thrust faults have moved the western assemblage and a significant portion of the overlap series over the eastern facies 
other important stratigraphic units of the region are mississippian through pennsylvanian clastics of the overlap assemblage which overlie both autochthonous and allochthonous units of the roberts mountains thrust 
younger late pennsylvanian to early permian clastics disconformably overlie the overlap assemblage 
in the pinyon range  high angle northeast and northwest trending faults and north trending faults  all with oblique displacement  and a younger set of east trending normal faults  are important elements in the structural framework of the region 
a tertiary age wrench faulting event  characterized by strike slip faulting and intrusion of felsic rocks into graben faults  probably contributed to the emplacement of gold deposits into the pinyon graben 
gold mineralization in the bowl area is related to felsite breccias 
the porphyritic phase consists of a series of rocks from feldspar porphyry to quartz porphyry and ranges in color from white to medium gray 
the fragmental unit contains up to of to mm diameter rounded and embayed quartz phenocrysts and feldspar phenocrysts in a white to light gray  fine grained  ash rich  clastic matrix 
the dark colored felsite is very similar to the feldspar porphyry except that the aphanitic felsite is often nearly black 
porphyritic felsite appears to be interbedded with the fragmental felsite in gently dipping tabular masses up to thick 
in the pot holes area a lens of fragmental felsite approximately feet thick intersects the low angle fault that is at the base of the robinson thrust plate 
the felsite breccias of the bowl area may be fault breccia to explosion breccias 
the breccia fragments are of variable lithology  reportedly including sediment fragments 
the matrix  which is generally altered  consists of fragmental felsite and is termed a sandy rhyolite 
the breccias are mineralized in the bowl area and possibly are important hosts in other parts of the property 
alteration within the rhyolite intrusive includes quartz sericite pyrite qsp associated with north and northeast trending shears 
the shear zones are fragmental and brecciated and contain very fine grained quartz  sericite and pyrite goethite  both as disseminations and on fractures 
away from the shear zones the rhyolite gradually becomes fresher  grading outward from relict feldspar ghosts into porphyritic rhyolite 
in the center of the intrusive along the east flank of rhyolite hill  as well as in some other areas  the intrusive has a granular texture and feldspars have been altered  leaving open clay filled vugs 
the sanded rhyolite consists of medium grained rounded clasts of glassy rhyolite breccia occurring near the margins and at the base of the intrusive  and locally as narrow stockwork zones in the intrusive 
the distribution and texture of the sanded rhyolite suggest that the unit formed in vitric chill margins and apparently was partially fluidized by subsequent hydrothermal activity 
sediments along the margins of the intrusive and immediately beneath the rhyolite have been silicified  decalcified and sulfidized and  in and around the mineralized cells  have been extensively oxidized hypogene oxidation 
sediments also occur as xenoliths throughout the rhyolite and can be observed in outcrop and in subsurface 
the margins of the xenoliths are usually partially absorbed and most contacts are gradational 
early stage exploration properties in general  these properties either do not have sufficient work completed to identify and report reserves or other mineralized material or we do not have a significant controlling interest or joint venture on the property 
certain of these exploration properties have been optioned and leased to other exploration companies in return for production royalties averaging approximately advance minimum royalties and  on some of the properties  work commitments 
for the properties under lease  the lessee is typically responsible for making the land payments including the blm fees and county property tax payments 
blm filing fees and county property tax payments were paid for approximately  unpatented mining claims held by allied nevada 

table of contents discussions have been initiated with various lessees to renegotiate agreements with terms that are in alignment with our corporate exploration objectives 
we will pursue other strategic options that could include exploration joint ventures  royalty agreements  or the sale or release of the mineral property 
property dispositions on december   madison enterprise corp 
madison exercised its option under an exploration agreement to acquire our battle mountain property consisting of unpatented mining claims in lander county  nevada by paying allied nevada million 
under the terms of the exploration agreement  allied nevada retained an nsr of for gold and silver and for other minerals 
additionally  madison is required to pay an amr of  annually subject to adjustment for inflation  which amount was paid together with madison s option exercise described above 
allied nevada received the amr payment from madison 
madison has an option in the exploration agreement to purchase the nsr for payment of million subject to an annual escalation 
in april  allied nevada completed the sale of its interest in the hamilton treasure hill mineral property consisting of patented and unpatented mining claims for million 
under terms of the agreement  allied nevada retained an nsr of  which is subject to a buyout for a payment of million in the first months from closing escalating thereafter to a maximum of million 
in october  allied nevada completed the sale of its interest in the wonder district mineral property for million 
the property consists of patented lode mining claim  townsite and associated water rights related to the claims and the townsite 
allied nevada does not retain an nsr on production from the property
