item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our results of operations and our financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report and risk factors in item a for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development  production and acquisition of unconventional natural gas and oil properties in the united states and british columbia 
we focus on tight gas sands and shale and have assembled leasehold interests aggregating approximately  gross  net acres as of december  we expect to leverage our management team s proven track record of finding and exploiting unconventional reservoirs through advanced completion  fracturing and drilling techniques 
as the operator of over of our production and proved reserves  we have a high degree of control over capital expenditures and other operating matters 
we currently operate or have interests in the following areas west texas ozona northeast wolfcamp  canyon sands  strawn and ellenburger cinco terry wolfcamp  canyon sands and ellenburger east texas north bald prairie cotton valley sands  bossier and cotton valley lime southwest kentucky boomerang new albany shale northeast british columbia montney tight gas and doig shale northern new mexico el vado east mancos shale segment reporting is not applicable to us as we have a single  company wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments 
we track only basic operational data by area 
we do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area 
we measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis 
at december   we owned working interests in producing oil and gas wells  had estimated proved reserves of approximately bcfe and were producing mmcfe d based on production for the month of december 
our average daily net production for through february was mmcfe d 
as of december   all of our proved reserves and production were located in ozona northeast and cinco terry in west texas and in north bald prairie in east texas 
at year end  our proved reserves were natural gas  proved developed and had a reserve life index of over twenty years based on production of  mmcfe 
in addition to our producing wells  we had identified  total drilling locations in ozona northeast  cinco terry and north bald prairie at december   of which are proved 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and gas 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demand  which is impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline 
table of contents capacity constraints  estimates of inventory storage levels  gas price differentials and other factors 
a factor potentially impacting the future supply balance is the recent increase in the united states lng import capacity 
significant lng capacity increases have been announced that may result in increased price volatility 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
a substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and liquidity that may be accessed through our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and through the capital market 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
future finding and development costs are subject to changes in the industry  including the costs of acquiring  drilling and completing our projects 
we focus our efforts on increasing oil and gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long term operations 
our future cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to manage our overall cost structure 
like all oil and gas production companies  we face the challenge of natural production declines 
oil and gas production from a given well naturally decreases over time 
additionally  our reserves have a rapid initial decline 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to develop and identify additional reserves  farm ins or other joint drilling ventures  and by acquisitions 
our future growth will depend upon our ability to continue to add oil and gas reserves in excess of production at a reasonable cost 
we will maintain our focus on the costs of adding reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves 
we also face the challenge of financing future acquisitions 
we believe we have adequate unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for possible acquisitions  temporary working capital needs and any expansion of our drilling program 
funding for future acquisitions also may require additional sources of financing  which may not be available 
reduction in capital expenditures and drilling activities in december  in response to a decline in oil  gas and ngl prices and uncertain market conditions  we announced that we were reducing our capital expenditure budget to million in  compared to million of actual capital expenditures in including million in exploration and development costs related to the acquisition of deep rights in ozona northeast in july 
we also have reduced the number of our operating rigs from five in june to two at february  we intend to fund capital expenditures excluding any acquisitions with internally generated cash flow  with any excess cash flow applied towards debt  working capital or strategic acquisitions 
we will continue to monitor commodity prices and operating expenses to determine any further adjustments to the capital budget and  unless commodity prices strengthen  we will materially reduce our capital expenditures and number of operated rigs 
the previously announced reduction in capital expenditures and drilling activities  along with any additional reductions undertaken by the company  could materially reduce our production volumes and revenues from pre levels and increase future expected costs necessary to develop existing reserves 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below 
table of contents are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under gaap 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas activities successful efforts accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
the significant principles for this method are geological and geophysical evaluation costs are expensed as incurred  dry holes for exploratory wells are expensed  and dry holes for developmental wells are capitalized  and capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties  including wells and related equipment and facilities  are evaluated for impairment based on an analysis of undiscounted future net cash flows in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net capitalized costs related to proved properties  then we recognize an impairment charge in income from operations equal to the difference between the net capitalized costs related to unproved properties and their estimated fair values based on the present value of the related future net cash flows 
we noted no impairment of our proved properties based on our analysis for the years ended december   or our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of changing results from operational activity and results 
changes in commodity prices  operation costs and techniques may also affect the overall evaluation of reservoirs 
a hypothetical decline in our december  proved reserves volumes would have been insignificant to depletion expense for the year ended december  nor would it have resulted in an impairment of oil and gas properties 
our estimated proved reserves as of december   and were prepared by degolyer and macnaughton 
derivative instruments and commodity derivative activities unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the collar contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty on our commodity derivatives positions and have considered the exposure in our internal valuations 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
changes in the derivative s fair value are currently recognized in the statement of operations unless specific commodity derivative hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow commodity 
table of contents derivatives  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the commodity derivative is effective 
the ineffective portion of the commodity derivative is recognized immediately in the statement of operations 
gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to oil and gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for commodity derivative accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current income or expense in the statement of operations 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled unrealized gain loss on commodity derivatives 
although we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  we use those instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices related to our oil and gas production 
accordingly  we record realized gains and losses under those instruments in other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized gain of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
a increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet  and a corresponding decrease to the gain on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
share based compensation we measure and record compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and outside directors based on estimated grant date fair values 
compensation costs for awards granted are recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of each option granted was estimated using an option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions during the years ended december  and there were no options granted during the year ended december  expected dividends expected volatility risk free interest rate expected life years years we have not paid out dividends historically  thus the dividend yields are estimated at zero percent 

table of contents since our shares were not publicly traded prior to our initial public offering on november   we used an average of historical volatility rates based upon other companies within our industry 
management believes that these average historical volatility rates are currently the best available indicator of expected volatility 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term of five years 
the expected lives of our options are determined based on the term of the option using the simplified method outlined in staff accounting bulletin assumptions are reviewed each time there is a new grant and may be impacted by actual fluctuation in our stock price  movements in market interest rates and option terms 
the use of different assumptions produces a different fair value for the options granted or modified and impacts the amount of compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
a or increase in the volatility  risk free interest rate or stock price would not have significantly impacted share based compensation expense for the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standard  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement  or sfas sfas amends and expands the disclosure requirements of fasb statement with the intent to provide users of financial statement with an enhanced understanding of i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  ii how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement and its related interpretations  and iii how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect and entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for years and interim periods beginning after november  the effect of adopting sfas is not expected to have a significant effect on our reported financial position or earnings 
in december  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards revised  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r  among other things  establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
this standard will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb  or sfas sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
it also establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires expanded disclosures 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
the effect of adopting sfas is not expected to have a significant effect on our reported financial position or earnings 
effects of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   or although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment 
it may also increase the cost of labor or 
table of contents supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher prices 
share based compensation our stock incentive plan allows grants of stock and options to employees and outside directors 
granting of awards may increase our general and administrative expenses subject to the size and timing of the grants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recent developments in reserve reporting on december   the sec released a final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  updating its oil and gas reporting requirements 
the new reporting requirements will be effective for our financial statements for the year ending december  and our year end proved reserve estimates 
the new reporting requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to establish the reasonable certainty of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes  allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves in sec filed documents currently  sec rules limit disclosure to only proved reserves  require companies to report the independence and qualifications of a reserves preparer or auditor  require companies to file a report when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserves audit  and require companies to report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices 
we are currently evaluating the impact that these new reporting requirements will have for the year ended december

oil and gas sales increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in oil and gas sales principally resulted from our increased ownership in the ozona northeast field as a result of our acquisition of the neo canyon interest in the fourth quarter of and increased revenue from our cinco terry and north bald prairie fields 
we now own substantially all of the working interest in ozona northeast 
of the  mmcfe of production reported for  approximately  mmcfe was attributable to the interest acquired from neo canyon 
the increase in oil and gas sales also resulted from continued development of our cinco terry and north bald prairie fields 
cinco terry production increased by  mmcfe compared to the prior year 
production from north bald prairie accounted for mmcfe in production for further  the average price per mcfe we received for our production increased from to per mcfe as average oil and gas prices increased significantly between the two years 
of the million increase in revenues  million was attributable to growth in volume with the remaining million due to oil and gas price increases 
natural gas sales represented of the total oil and gas sales in compared to in  as our cinco terry field has a larger component of oil and ngls in its production 

table of contents commodity derivative activities 
realized losses and gains from our commodity derivative activity increased our earnings by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
realized gains and losses are derived from the relative movement of gas prices in relation to the range of prices in our collars or the fixed notional pricing for the respective years 
the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives was million for and the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was million for as natural gas commodity prices increase  the fair value of the open portion of those positions decreases 
as natural gas commodity prices decrease  the fair value of the open portion of those positions increases 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled unrealized gain loss on commodity derivatives 
lease operating expense 
our lease operating expenses  or loe  increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million per mcfe from million per mcfe for the year ended december  the increase in loe over the prior year was primarily a result of the acquisition of the neo canyon working interest and strawn ellenburger deep rights in ozona northeast 
the increase in was also attributable to initial startup costs  including compression and treating costs in cinco terry and north bald prairie  as well as a rise in repair and maintenance costs in ozona northeast 
following is a summary of lease operating expenses per mcfe change change compressor rental and repair pumpers and supervision ad valorem taxes repairs and maintenance water hauling  insurance and other workovers total severance and production taxes 
our production taxes increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in production taxes was a function of the increase in oil and gas sales between the two periods 
severance and productions taxes amounted to approximately and of oil and gas sales for the respective years 
the increase in the severance and production taxes as a percentage of oil and gas sales is due to higher severance tax rates for ngl revenues from cinco terry and higher estimated taxes after abatements for newer wells in ozona northeast and cinco terry 
exploration 
we recorded million of exploration expense for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  exploration expense for the period resulted from one dry hole drilled in ozona northeast and  of lease extensions in ozona northeast 
we incur these costs to maintain our leasehold positions and accordingly  we expense them as incurred 
exploration expense for the period resulted from the drilling of two dry holes in our boomerang project and cinco terry project 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
in accordance with sfas  we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including proved and unproved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting 
as a result of this review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets  we recorded an impairment of oil and gas properties of million and  in and  respectively 
the impairment resulted from a non cash write off of million of drilling costs incurred for three test wells in our boomerang project and related to the drilling and completion of three wells in our northeast british columbia project 
the impairment resulted from the abandonment of an expiring leasehold position in ozona northeast covering  acres

interest expense  net 
our interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was substantially the result of our lower average debt level and lower interest rates in additionally  interest expense for the year ended december  included million related to the beneficial conversion feature of our convertible notes and  relating to accrued interest on the convertible notes 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december   from a benefit of  for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense was due to the increase in our income before income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared with a benefit of for the year ended december  the tax benefit for the year ended december  related to the release of a valuation allowance on net operating loss carryovers generated by aog before the combination of aog and approach under the contribution agreement on november

realized gains from our commodity derivative activity increased our earnings million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in fair value of commodity derivatives was a million decrease for the year ended december  and an million increase for the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  we used gas swaps to mitigate commodity price risk 
the general improvement in underlying commodity prices caused the decrease in realized gains in compared to during and  commodity prices tended to be lower than the notional prices specified in our swap agreements  which resulted in a gain to us 
additionally  we entered into a mix of swaps and collars in  which resulted in less volatility to the results of operations 
lease operating expense 
our lease operating expenses  or loe  decreased  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the primary factor in the slight decrease in loe was the release in mid of one of our seven rented 
table of contents compressors and an amine unit  which was partially offset by higher ad valorem taxes in the year ended december  severance and production taxes 
our production taxes decreased  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in production taxes is a function of decreased oil and gas revenues that were more than offset by refunds received in applicable to prior years 
severance and production taxes were and as a percentage of oil and gas sales for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
our natural gas production from the ozona northeast field is afforded a severance tax rate lower than the normal rate 
however  we are required to file abatement requests with the state of texas to receive the lower rate 
until the abatement requests are approved  we are required to pay the normal rate 
exploration and impairment of non producing properties 
our exploration costs decreased  to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the period included dry hole costs of  from a well in our boomerang prospect and  from a well in our cinco terry project 
the period included dry hole costs of million related to two wells drilled on a prospect in pecos county  texas   from one well in ozona northeast and  from a well in our boomerang prospect 
our impairment of non producing properties of  and  in and  respectively  arose from the abandonment of a leasehold position in ozona northeast in and the abandonment of our leasehold position in pecos county in as a result of the abandonment in pecos county  we no longer anticipate incurring any future costs related to these leaseholds

our dd a expense decreased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased production partially offset by increased oil and gas property costs in our dd a expense per mcfe produced increased by  or  to per mcfe for the year ended december   as compared to per mcfe for the year ended december  interest expense  net 
our interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  included in interest expense for the year ended december  were million related to the beneficial conversion feature of our convertible notes and  relating to accrued interest on the convertible notes 
additionally  we had increased borrowings between the two periods to fund our development of the ozona northeast field 
these increases in interest expense were partially offset by lower interest rates in the period 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased million  or  to a benefit of  for the year ended december  from a provision of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate was a benefit of and an expense of for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
income taxes decreased consistent with our income before tax and the realization of a million tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance on net operating loss carryovers generated by aog before the combination of aog and approach under the contribution agreement on november  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generally will rely on cash generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and  to the extent that credit and capital market conditions will allow  future public equity and debt offerings to satisfy our liquidity needs 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions depends upon our future operating performance  availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which is affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
given the current conditions of credit and capital markets  we cannot predict whether additional liquidity from debt or equity financings beyond our revolving credit facility will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  in the foreseeable future 
our cash flow from operations is driven by commodity prices and production volumes and the effect of commodity derivatives 
prices for oil and gas are affected by national and international economic and political environments  national and global supply and demand for hydrocarbons  seasonal influences of weather and other factors beyond our control 
our working capital is significantly influenced by changes in commodity prices and significant declines in prices will cause a decrease in our exploration and development expenditures and production volumes 
cash flows from operations are primarily used to fund exploration and development of our mineral interests 
we intend to fund capital expenditures excluding any acquisitions with internally generated cash flow  with any excess cash flow applied towards debt  working capital or strategic acquisitions 
we will continue to monitor commodity prices and operating expenses to determine any further adjustments to the capital budget 
unless commodity prices strengthen  we will further reduce our expected capital expenditures from our previously announced capital budget of million  which reduction could be substantial 
a further reduction in capital expenditures could materially reduce our production volumes and revenues from pre levels and increase future expected costs necessary to develop existing reserves 
for the year ended december   our primary sources of cash were from financing and operating activities 
approximately million from borrowings net of payments under our revolving credit facility and cash from operations were used to fund our drilling program and the acquisition of a working interest below the top of the strawn formation and rights to miles of gathering system in the ozona northeast field 
our primary sources of cash in were from financing and operating activities 
approximately million from borrowings under our revolving credit facility  million from the issuance of common stock  million from proceeds from convertible notes and million cash from operations were used to fund our drilling activities  repay our revolving credit facility and purchase  shares of our common stock from the selling stockholder in our ipo 
for the year ended december   our primary sources of cash were from financing and operating activities 
approximately million from borrowings net of payments under our revolving credit facility  million from the issuance of common stock  million from a loan from one of our stockholders and cash from operations were used to fund our million drilling program  the acquisition of another working interest in the ozona northeast field and million to repurchase shares and cancel stock options 
our cash flow from operations is driven by commodity prices and production volumes 
prices for oil and gas are driven by seasonal influences of weather  national and international economic and political environments and  increasingly  from heightened demand for hydrocarbons from emerging nations  particularly china and india 
our working capital is significantly influenced by changes in commodity prices and significant declines in prices could decrease our exploration and development expenditures 
cash flows from operations were primarily used to fund exploration and development of our mineral interests 
in comparing and  our cash flows from operations increased in due mostly to higher oil and gas sales partially offset by an increase in most operating expense categories and a decrease in working capital components during the year ended december  in comparing and  our cash flows from operations decreased in

the million in cash flow generated during period increased by million from due primarily to an increase in oil and gas sales and a decrease in general and administrative expenses 
partially offsetting the increase in oil and gas sales and decrease in general administrative expenses was a reduction in working capital and an increase in loe and production taxes in the period compared to the period 
for the year ended december   our cash flow from operations was used for drilling activities 
the million in cash flow generated during decreased million from due mostly to lower oil and gas sales and higher general and administrative expenses in the period

these notes were converted to outstanding shares of our common stock in connection with our ipo in november for  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility  repaid million under the facility and spent million to purchase common stock and related options from a former employee 
in  and in connection with our ipo and exercise by the underwriters of their overallotment option  we sold  shares of our common stock in november at per share 
the gross proceeds of our ipo and over allotment option were approximately million  which resulted in net proceeds to the company of million after deducting underwriter discounts and commissions of approximately million 
the aggregate net proceeds of approximately million received by the company were used as follows in millions repayment of revolving credit facility repurchase of stock held by selling stockholder in  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility and repaid million 
additionally in  we sold approximately million of common stock and spent million to purchase common stock and related options from a former employee 
these net proceeds were primarily used to fund a portion of our drilling program in ozona northeast and cinco terry and the acquisition of our boomerang prospect 
our goal is to actively manage our borrowings to help us maintain the flexibility to expand and invest  and to avoid the problems associated with highly leveraged companies of large interest costs and possible debt reductions restricting ongoing operations 
we believe that cash flow from operations will finance substantially all of our anticipated drilling  exploration and capital needs in we may use our revolving credit facility for possible acquisitions and temporary working capital needs 
we also may determine to access the public equity or debt market for potential acquisitions  working capital or other liquidity needs  if such financing is available on acceptable terms 
given the current conditions of credit and capital markets  we cannot predict whether additional liquidity from debt or equity financings beyond our credit facility will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  in the foreseeable future 
future capital expenditures for we intend to fund capital expenditures excluding any acquisitions with internally generated cash flow  with any excess cash flow applied towards debt  working capital or strategic acquisitions 
the capital expenditure budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors  including economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas  the results of our development and exploration efforts  the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and other participants for drilling prospects  our financial results  the availability of leases on reasonable terms and our ability to obtain permits for the drilling locations 
in december  we announced an exploratory and development budget of million for we will continue to monitor commodity prices and operating expenses to determine any further adjustments to the capital budget  and will materially reduce our budget unless commodity prices strengthen 
a further reduction in capital expenditures would materially reduce our production volumes and revenues from pre levels and increase future development costs for our existing reserves 

table of contents credit facility we have a million revolving credit facility with a borrowing base set at million 
the borrowing base is redetermined semi annually on or before each april and october based on our oil and gas reserves 
we or the lenders can each request one additional borrowing base redetermination each calendar year 
our next scheduled redetermination date is april  the maturity date under our revolving credit facility is july  borrowings bear interest based on the agent bank s prime rate  or the sum of the libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to based on the borrowings outstanding compared to the borrowing base 
in addition  we pay an annual commitment of of non used borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 
we had outstanding borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility at december  the interest rate applicable to our outstanding borrowings was and as of december  and december   respectively 
we also have outstanding unused letters of credit under our revolving credit facility totaling  at december   which reduce amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
the agent bank  other participating banks and their respective commitment percentages are as follows the frost national bank agent bank  jpmorgan chase bank  na  fortis capital corp 
and keybank national association 
our revolving credit facility contains financial and other covenants that require maintenance of a minimum modified ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to  require maintenance of a debt to ebitdax ratio of to or less  and restrict cash dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of other debt  consolidations and mergers  the level of operating leases  assets sales  investments in other entities and liens on properties 
we were in compliance with the covenants under our revolving credit facility at december  loans under our revolving credit facility are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our west texas assets and equity interests in our subsidiaries 
current credit market conditions have resulted in lenders significantly tightening their lending practices 
to date we have experienced no disruptions in our ability to access our revolving credit facility 
however  our lenders have substantial ability to reduce our borrowing base on the basis of subjective factors  including the loan collateral value that each lender  in its discretion and using the methodology  assumptions and discount rates as such lender customarily uses in evaluating oil and gas properties  assigns to our properties 
we cannot predict with certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment or guarantee that the lenders under our revolving credit facility will not decrease our borrowing base in the future 
if our borrowing base was decreased below our total outstanding borrowings  resulting in a borrowing base deficiency  then we would be required under the credit agreement  within days after notice from the agent bank  to i pledge additional collateral to cure the borrowing base deficiency  ii prepay the borrowing base deficiency in full  or iii commit to prepay the borrowing base deficiency in six equal monthly installments  with the first installment being due within days after receipt of notice from the agent bank 
there is no guarantee that  in the event of such a borrowing base deficiency  we would be able to timely cure the deficiency 
at february   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
contractual commitments our contractual commitments consist of long term debt  daywork drilling contracts  operating lease obligations  asset retirement obligations and employment agreements with executive officers 

table of contents our long term debt is composed of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit facility and note line of credit for a discussion of our revolving credit facility 
we periodically enter into contractual arrangements under which we are committed to expend funds to drill wells in the future  including agreements to secure drilling rig services  which require us to make future minimum payments to the rig operators 
we record drilling commitments in the periods in which well capital is incurred or rig services are provided 
our commitment under the drilling contracts is million at december  in april  we signed a five year lease for approximately  square feet of new office space in fort worth  texas 
in august  we expanded our office space under an amendment to the lease to approximately  square feet 
in january  we began rent payments of approximately  per month  including common area expenses 
we have a lease for our prior space in fort worth that expires in may our remaining obligation under this lease is approximately  per month until expiration in may at december   we had signed subleases for all of our prior office space 
we have outstanding employment agreements with executive officers that contain automatic renewal provisions providing that such agreements may be automatically renewed for successive terms of one year unless employment is terminated at the end of the term by written notice given to the employee not less than days prior to the end of such term 
our maximum commitment under the employment agreements  which would apply if the employees covered by these agreements were all terminated without cause  was approximately million at december  the following table summarizes these commitments as of december  in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt daywork drilling contracts operating lease obligations asset retirement obligations employment agreements with executive officers total see note line of credit to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revolving credit facility 
daywork drilling contracts related to two drilling rigs contracted through march  operating lease obligations are for office space 
we will receive  for office space that has been subleased from january through may see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our asset retirement obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include undrawn letters of credit  operating lease agreements and gas transportation commitments 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk some of the information below contains forward looking statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to 
table of contents market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices  and other related factors 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for commodity derivative and investment purposes  not for trading purposes 
commodity price risk given the current economic outlook  we expect commodity prices to remain volatile 
even modest decreases in commodity prices can materially affect our revenues and cash flow 
in addition  if commodity prices remain suppressed for a significant amount of time  we could be required under successful efforts accounting rules to perform a non cash write down of our oil and gas properties 
we enter into financial swaps and collars to mitigate portions of the risk of market price fluctuations 
we do not designate such instruments as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  we record open commodity derivative positions on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and recognize changes in such fair values as income expense on our consolidated statements of operations as they occur 
at december   we have the following commodity derivative positions outstanding volume mmbtu mmbtu period monthly total floor ceiling fixed nymex henry hub costless collars costless collars waha differential fixed price swaps at december  and december   the fair value of our open derivative contracts was an asset of approximately million and  respectively 
jp morgan ventures energy corporation is currently the only counterparty to our commodity derivatives positions 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty on our commodity derivatives positions 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
jpmorgan chase bank  na is a participant in our revolving credit facility and the collateral for the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility is used as collateral for our commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the collar contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized gain of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
a increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet  and a corresponding decrease to the gain on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
effective january   we adopted fas  which among other things  requires enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities carried at fair value 
as defined in fas  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
we use market data or assumptions that market participants would use in 
table of contents pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to use the best available information 
fas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by fas are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
at december   we had no level measurements 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
our derivatives  which consist primarily of commodity swaps and collars  are valued using commodity market data which is derived by combining raw inputs and quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves 
where observable inputs are available  directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  the instrument is categorized in level at december   our commodity derivatives were valued using level measurements 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value
