table of contents c narrative description of business property and casualty insurance pooling arrangement our pooled companies are parties to the pooling arrangement 
in general  under the pooling arrangement  state auto mutual assumes premiums  losses and expenses from each of the remaining pooled companies and in turn cedes to each of the pooled companies a specified portion of premiums  losses and expenses based on each of the pooled companies respective pooling percentages 
state auto mutual then retains the balance of the pooled business 
the participation percentage for the stfc pooled companies has remained at since prior to  the pooling arrangement covered all property and casualty insurance written by the pooled companies except state auto mutual s voluntary assumed reinsurance  middle market business insurance written by state auto mutual and meridian security and intercompany catastrophe reinsurance written by state auto p c 
in  we made the following changes to the pooling arrangement added beacon national to the pool with a participation percentage of added patrons mutual and litchfield to the pool with participation percentages of and  respectively  reduced state auto mutual s participation percentage from to to accommodate the participation percentages allocated to patrons mutual and litchfield  and included state auto middle market business insurance written by state auto mutual and meridian security

in july  milbank became a owned subsidiary of stfc 
previously  milbank was a owned subsidiary of state auto mutual 

table of contents the following table sets forth a summary of the pooling arrangement participation percentages of stfc and state auto mutual  aggregating their respective affiliates and owned subsidiaries year stfc pooled companies state auto mutual pooled companies current time period is for the year ended december  unless otherwise noted 
it is not management s intention to recommend an adjustment to the stfc pooled companies participation level in the foreseeable future 
under applicable governance procedures  if the pooling arrangement were to be amended  management would make recommendations to the independent committees of the board of directors of both state auto mutual and stfc 
the independent committees review and evaluate such factors as they deem relevant and recommend any appropriate pooling change to the board of directors of both state auto mutual and stfc 
the pooling arrangement is terminable by any of our pooled companies at any time by any party by giving twelve months notice to the other parties and their respective domiciliary insurance departments 
none of our pooled companies currently intends to terminate the pooling arrangement 
under the terms of the pooling arrangement  all subject premiums  incurred losses  loss expenses and other underwriting expenses are prorated among our pooled companies on the basis of their participation in the pool 
by spreading the underwriting risk the pooling arrangement is designed to produce more uniform and stable underwriting results for each of our pooled companies than any one company would experience individually 
this has the effect of providing each of our pooled companies with a similar mix of pooled property and casualty insurance business on a net basis 
prior to july   the pooling arrangement excluded catastrophic losses and loss adjustment expenses that were reinsured under our catastrophe assumption agreement defined below  as well as the premium for such exposures 
state auto p c reinsured each insurer in the state auto group for this layer of reinsurance in the amount of million in excess of million 
no losses were paid by state auto p c under the catastrophe assumption agreement in  or the state auto group did not renew the catastrophe assumption agreement upon its expiration on july  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reinsurance arrangements in this item for further information regarding the catastrophe assumption agreement 
our nonstandard automobile program written through sa national  provides insurance for private passenger automobile risks which do not qualify for the standard or preferred automobile insurance market 
typically  nonstandard risks have higher than average loss experience and an overall higher degree of risk than standard or preferred automobile business 
we do not include the business of sa national in the pooling arrangement 
management agreement state auto p c provides the employees to perform all organizational  operational and management functions for the state auto group and state auto mutual provides certain operating facilities  including our corporate headquarters  for the state auto group through management and cost sharing agreements 
in addition  the insurance operations of the patrons group are conducted at facilities owned by patrons mutual and litchfield 

table of contents our primary management agreement  which we refer to as the management agreement  has a ten year term and renews for an additional ten year period unless terminated sooner in accordance with its terms 
if the management agreement was terminated for any reason  we would have to relocate our facilities to continue our operations 
however  we do not currently anticipate the termination of the management agreement 
see properties included in item of this form k 
marketing as of january   the state auto group marketed its products in states through independent insurance agencies 
none of the companies in the state auto group has any contracts with managing general agencies 
we view our independent insurance agents as our primary customers  because they are in a position to recommend either our insurance products or those of a competitor to their customers 
we strongly support the independent agency system and believe its maintenance is essential to our present and future success 
as such  we continually develop programs and procedures to enhance our agency relationships  including the following regular travel by senior management and regional office staff to meet with agents  in person  in their home states  training opportunities  incentives related to profit and growth  and an agent stock purchase plan 
in addition  we share the cost of approved advertising with selected agencies 
we actively help our agencies develop professional sales skills of their staffs 
our training programs include both products and sales training conducted in our home office 
further  our training programs include disciplined follow up and coaching for an extended time 
other targeted training sessions are held in our branch office locations from time to time  as well as in our agents offices 
we provide our agents with defined travel and cash incentives if they achieve certain sales and underwriting profit levels 
further  we recognize our very top agencies measured by consistent profitability  achievement of written premium thresholds and growth as inner circle agencies 
inner circle agencies are rewarded with additional trip and financial incentives  including additional contingent commissions and additional contributions to their inner circle agent stock purchase plan  a part of our agent stock purchase plan described below 
to strengthen agency commitment to producing profitable business and further develop our agency relationships  we make available to our agents a stock purchase plan which provides them with the opportunity to use their commission income to purchase our stock 
our transfer agent administers this stock purchase plan using commission dollars assigned by the agents to purchase shares on the open market through a stockbroker 
we have made continuing efforts to use technology to make it easier for our agents to do business with us 
we offer internet based i rating  ii policy application submission  iii execution of changes to policies for certain products and iv claims submission 
in addition  we provide our agents with the opportunity to maintain policyholder records electronically  avoiding the expense of preparing and storing paper records 
software developed by sis also enhances the ability of our agents and us to take advantage of electronic data submission 
we believe that  since agents and their customers realize better service and efficiency through automation  they value their relationship with us 
automation can make it easier for an agent to do business with us  which attracts prospective agents and enhances existing agencies relationships with us 
during  the state auto group  received premiums on products marketed in alabama  arizona  arkansas  colorado  connecticut  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  iowa  kansas  kentucky  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  north dakota  ohio  oklahoma  pennsylvania  rhode island  south carolina  south dakota  tennessee  texas  utah  vermont  virginia  west virginia and wisconsin 
during  the eight states that contributed the greatest percentage of our direct premiums written were as follows ohio  kentucky  indiana  tennessee  pennsylvania  maryland  minnesota and arkansas 

table of contents claims our claims division emphasizes timely investigation of claims  settlement of meritorious claims for equitable amounts  maintenance of adequate case reserves for claims  and control of external claims adjustment expenses 
achievement of these goals supports our marketing efforts by providing agents and policyholders with prompt and effective service 
claim settlement authority levels are established for each adjuster  supervisor and manager based on his or her level of expertise and experience 
our claims division is responsible for reviewing the claim  obtaining necessary documentation and establishing loss and expense reserves of certain claims 
generally  property or casualty claims estimated to reach  or above are sent to our home office to be supervised by claims division specialists 
branches with low volumes of large claims are assigned a lower dollar threshold for referring claims to the home office 
in territories in which there is not sufficient volume to justify having full time adjusters  we use independent appraisers and adjusters to evaluate and settle claims under the supervision of claims division personnel 
we attempt to minimize claims adjusting costs by settling as many claims as possible through our internal claims staff and  if possible  by settling disputes regarding automobile physical damage and property insurance claims first party claims through arbitration 
in addition  selected agents have authority to settle small first party claims  which improves claims service 
our claim representatives use third party  proprietary bodily injury evaluation software to help them value bodily injury claims  except for the most severe injury cases 
our claims contact centers allow us to improve claims efficiency and economy by concentrating the handling of smaller  less complex claims in a centralized environment 
we provide claim service hours a day  seven days a week  either through associates in our claims contact centers  which are located in des moines  iowa and columbus  ohio  or  for a few overnight hours  through a third party service provider 
reserves loss reserves are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to settle all losses incurred as of the end of the accounting period  based on facts  circumstances and historical trends then known 
during the loss settlement period  additional facts regarding individual claims may become known  and consequently it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability 
the results of our operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 
we maintain reserves for the eventual payment of losses and loss expenses for both reported claims and incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
loss expense reserves are intended to cover the ultimate costs of settling all losses  including investigation  litigation and in house claims processing costs associated with such losses 
reserves for reported losses are initially established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined based on our reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and applicable policy provisions 
the formula reserves are based on historical paid loss data for similar claims with provisions for trend changes caused by inflation 
loss and loss expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  changes in exposure units  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates and economic conditions 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis 
as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis which have not settled after six months  are case reserved at that time 
although our management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is no precise method for determining the ultimate liability 
we do not discount loss

the following table sets forth our development of reserves for losses and loss expenses from through net liability for losses and loss expenses payable sets forth the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date  net of reinsurance recoverable  for each year shown 
this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims incurred during the current year or incurred during prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date  including losses incurred but not reported to us 
the upper section of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid with respect to the previously reported reserve as of the end of each succeeding year 
for example  through december   we have paid of the losses and loss expenses that had been incurred but not paid  as estimated at december  the lower portion of the table shows the current estimate of the previously reported reserve based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the claims incurred 

table of contents the amounts on the cumulative redundancy deficiency line represent the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
for example  the calendar year reserve has developed a million or deficiency through december  this million amount has been included in operating results over the ten years and did not have a significant effect on income in any one year 
in evaluating the information in the table  it should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  the amount of the redundancy or deficiency evaluated at december   on claims incurred in includes the cumulative redundancy or deficiency for years  and conditions and trends that have affected the development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
in   and  the pooling arrangement was amended to increase our share of premiums  losses and expenses 
an amount of assets equal to the increase in net liabilities was transferred to us from our parent company in   and in conjunction with each year s respective pooling change 
in  the migi insurers were added to the pool and our share of their net liabilities and assets were transferred to us from them 
in  beacon national  the patrons insurance group and state auto middle market business were added to the pool and accordingly net assets equal to the increase in net liabilities were transferred to us from them 
the amount of the assets transferred on the reserve liabilities assumed in     and has been netted against and has reduced the cumulative amounts paid for years prior to     and  respectively

as the pooling arrangement provides for the right of offset  we have reported losses and loss expenses payable ceded to our parent company as assets only in situations when net amounts ceded to our parent company exceed that assumed 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the reinsurance recoverable to the amount reported in our consolidated financial statements at each balance sheet date reinsurance recoverable amount netted against assumed from state auto mutual net reinsurance recoverable reinsurance members of the state auto group follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of their exposures and paying to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received 
insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses 
although 
table of contents reinsurance does not legally discharge the individual members of the state auto group from primary liability for the full amount of limits applicable under their policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
see the detailed discussion of our reinsurance arrangements at item of this form k  management  discussion and analysis of financial condition and liquidity and capital resources reinsurance arrangements 
see narrative description of business regulation of this item for a discussion of the terrorism risk insurance act of  and its successor  the terrorism risk insurance extension act of regulation most states  including all the domiciliary states of the state auto group  have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems 
each insurance company in our holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within our holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
pursuant to these laws  the respective insurance departments may examine any members of the state auto group  at any time  require disclosure of material transactions involving insurer members of our holding company system  and require prior notice and an opportunity to disapprove of certain extraordinary transactions  including  but not limited to  extraordinary dividends to stockholders 
pursuant to these laws  all transactions within our holding company system affecting any insurance subsidiary within the state auto group must be fair and equitable 
in addition  approval of the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the control of an insurer 
the insurance laws of all the domiciliary states of the state auto group provide that no person may acquire direct or indirect control of a domestic insurer without obtaining the prior written approval of the state insurance commissioner for such acquisition 
in addition to being regulated by the insurance department of its state of domicile  each of our insurance companies is subject to supervision and regulation in the states in which we transact business 
such supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of an insurance company s business operations and financial condition 
the primary purpose of such supervision and regulation is to ensure financial stability of insurance companies for the protection of policyholders 
the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad regulatory powers relative to granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating trade practices  licensing agents  approving policy forms  setting reserve requirements  determining the form and content of required statutory financial statements  prescribing the types and amount of investments permitted and requiring minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus 
although premium rate regulation varies among states and lines of insurance  such regulations generally require approval of the regulatory authority prior to any changes in rates 
in addition  all of the states in which the state auto group transacts business have enacted laws which restrict these companies underwriting discretion 
examples of these laws include restrictions on policy terminations  restrictions on agency terminations and laws requiring companies to accept any applicant for automobile insurance 
these laws may adversely affect the ability of the insurers in the state auto group to earn a profit on their underwriting operations 
we are required to file detailed annual reports with the supervisory agencies in each of the states in which we do business  and our business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time 
there can be no assurance that such regulatory requirements will not become more stringent in the future and have an adverse effect on the operations of the state auto group 
dividends 
our insurance subsidiaries generally are restricted by the insurance laws of our respective states of domicile as to the amount of dividends we may pay without the prior approval of our respective state regulatory authorities 
generally  the maximum dividend that may be paid by an insurance subsidiary during any year without prior regulatory approval is limited to the greater of a stated percentage of that subsidiary s statutory surplus as of a certain date  or adjusted net income of the subsidiary for the preceding year 
under current law at 
table of contents december   adjusted for dividend payments made in the previous twelve month period  a total of million is available in for payment as a dividend from our insurance subsidiaries to stfc without prior approval from our respective domiciliary state insurance departments 
stfc received dividends of million  million  and million in   and  respectively  from its insurance subsidiaries 
rates and related regulation 
except as discussed below  we are not aware of the adoption of any adverse legislation or regulation in any state in which we conducted business during which would materially impact our business 
in january  the florida legislature enacted new legislation which made fundamental changes to the property and casualty insurance business in florida 
this legislation was intended to address the cost of residential property insurance in florida 
after careful analysis of this legislation  we concluded that we could no longer operate our personal lines on a profitable basis in that state 
accordingly  during the second quarter  we filed an application with the florida department of insurance to withdraw from this state s personal lines insurance market effective january  as of january   all of our personal lines policies in florida have not been renewed 
we continue to write commercial lines business in florida 
in  we wrote million of premium in florida compared to million in  nearly all of which was business insurance 
many of the states in which we operate have passed or are considering legislation restricting or banning the use of credit scoring in the rating and risk selection process 
the fair and accurate credit transactions act  passed by the us congress in  directed the federal trade commission ftc to consult with the office of fair housing and equal opportunity on  among other things  how the use of credit information may affect the availability and affordability of property casualty insurance  and whether the use of certain factors by credit scoring systems could have a disparate impact on minorities 
in july of  the ftc released a report on credit scoring and its impact on automobile insurance 
the ftc concluded that credit based scoring is an effective predictor of risk with respect to the issuance of automobile insurance policies to consumers  but has little effect as an indicator of racial or ethnic status of consumers 
despite the ftc s conclusions  some consumer groups and certain regulatory and legislative entities continue to resist the use of credit scoring in the rating and risk selection process 
in  the ftc asked nine of the nation s largest homeowners insurance companies to provide information that the ftc says will allow it to determine how consumer credit data are used by the companies in underwriting and rate setting in this line of business 
the results of this study are not expected until late in or early  and its results could affect the future use of credit scoring 
banning or restricting this practice or data mining would limit our ability  and the ability of other carriers  to take advantage of the predictive value of this information 
in an attempt to make capital and surplus requirements more accurately reflect the underwriting risk of different lines of insurance  as well as investment risks that attend insurers operations  the national association of insurance commissioners naic annually tests insurers risk based capital requirements 
as of december   each insurer affiliated with us was in compliance with its respective risk based capital requirements 
the property and casualty insurance industry is also affected by court decisions 
in general  premium rates are actuarially determined to enable an insurance company to generate an underwriting profit 
these rates contemplate a certain level of risk 
the courts may modify  in a number of ways  the level of risk which insurers had expected to assume  including eliminating exclusions  expanding the terms of the contract  multiplying limits of coverage  creating rights for policyholders not intended to be included in the contract and interpreting applicable statutes expansively to create obligations on insurers not originally considered when the statute was passed 
courts have also undone legal reforms passed by legislatures  which reforms were intended to reduce a litigant s rights of action or amounts recoverable and so reduce the costs borne by the insurance mechanism 
these court decisions can adversely affect an insurer s profitability 
they also create pressure on rates charged for coverages adversely affected  and this can cause a legislative response resulting in rate suppression that can unfavorably impact an insurer 
the terrorism risk insurance act of and its successor  the terrorism risk insurance extension act of collectively  the terrorism acts require the federal government and the insurance industry to share in 
table of contents insured losses up to billion per year resulting from future terrorist attacks within the united states 
under the terrorism acts  commercial property and casualty insurers must offer their commercial policyholders coverage against certified acts of terrorism  but the policyholders may choose to reject this coverage 
if the policyholder rejects coverage for certified acts of terrorism  we intend  subject to the approval of the state regulators  to cover only such acts of terrorism that are not certified acts under the terrorism acts and that do not arise out of nuclear  biological or chemical agents 
in december  the united states congress extended the terrorism acts through december  at the same time  congress made modest changes to the terrorism acts for example  deleting the distinction between certified and non certified essentially foreign and domestic acts of terrorism 
lines of business covered  as well as certain important coverage features such as loss triggers  company deductibles and industry retentions were not changed 
we are evaluating these recent changes to the terrorism acts and are taking actions to comply 
our current property reinsurance treaties exclude certified acts of terrorism 
investments our investment portfolio is managed to provide growth of statutory surplus to facilitate increased premium writings over the long term while maintaining the ability to fund current insurance operations 
the primary objectives are to generate income  preserve capital and maintain liquidity 
our investment portfolio is managed separately from that of our parent company and its subsidiaries  and investment results are not shared by our pooled companies through the pooling arrangement 
stateco performs investment management services for us and our parent company and its subsidiaries  although investment policies implemented by stateco continue to be set for each company through the investment committee of its respective board of directors 
our decision to make a specific investment is influenced primarily by the following factors a investment risks  b general market conditions  c relative valuations of investment vehicles  d general market interest rates  e our liquidity requirements at any given time  and f our current federal income tax position and relative spread between after tax yields on tax exempt and taxable fixed maturity investments 
we have investment policy guidelines with respect to purchasing fixed maturity investments for our insurance subsidiaries which preclude investments in bonds that are rated below investment grade by a recognized rating service 
our fixed maturities portfolio is composed of high quality  investment grade issues  comprised almost entirely of debt issues rated aaa or aa 
as of december  and  our bond portfolio had a fair value that totaled  million and  million  respectively 
our fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  according to the financial accounting standards board fasb statement  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
our maximum investment in any single note or bond is limited to of statutory assets  other than obligations of the us government or government agencies  for which there is no limit 
generally  investments in equity securities are selected based on their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
see item of this form k  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared to investment operations segment market risks  for a discussion regarding the market risks related to our investment portfolio

invested assets include fixed maturities at amortized cost  equity securities and other invested assets at cost and cash equivalents 
net investment income is net of investment expenses and does not include realized or unrealized investment gains or losses or provision for income taxes

competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete with numerous insurance companies  many of which are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial resources 
in addition  because our products are marketed exclusively through independent insurance agencies  most of which represent more than one company  we face competition within each agency 
see narrative description of business marketing in item and distribution system and competition in item a of this form k 
we compete through underwriting criteria  appropriate pricing  quality service to our policyholders and our agents  and a fully developed agency relations program

table of contents item a 
risk factors statements contained in this form k may be forward looking within the meaning of the section e of the exchange act 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our operating results to differ materially from those projected 
the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual financial performance 
reserves if our estimated liability for losses and loss expenses is incorrect  our reserves may be inadequate to cover our ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses and may have to be increased 
we establish and carry  as a liability  reserves based on actuarial estimates of the amount to be paid in the future to settle all claims incurred as of the end of the accounting period 
we maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for losses and loss expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead represent estimates  generally using actuarial projection techniques at a given accounting date 
these reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency  legal theories of liability and other factors 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  trends in loss costs  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
additionally  there may be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of an insured event and the time a claim is actually reported to the insurer 
we refine reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled 
we record adjustments to reserves in the results of operations for the periods in which the estimates are changed 
in establishing reserves  we take into account estimated recoveries for reinsurance and salvage and subrogation 
because estimating reserves is an inherently uncertain process  currently established reserves may not be adequate 
if we conclude the estimates are incorrect and our reserves are inadequate  we are obligated to increase our reserves 
an increase in reserves results in an increase in losses and a reduction in our net income for the period in which the deficiency in reserves is identified 
accordingly  an increase in reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
catastrophe losses and geographic concentrations the occurrence of catastrophic events could materially reduce our profitability 
our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophic events 
we have experienced  and will in the future experience  catastrophe losses that may cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 
our ability to write new business also could be affected 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural events  including hurricanes  hailstorms  tornadoes  windstorms  earthquakes  severe winter weather and fires  none of which are within our control 
catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly impact our results 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
additionally  catastrophe losses incurred by residual markets or pooling mechanisms such as wind pools in certain states could trigger assessments to the company 
such assessments could be material and may not be recoupable  depending on the applicable state mechanism 
the magnitude of loss from a catastrophe is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposure in the affected area 
catastrophes to which we are exposed  including hurricanes  earthquakes and other perils  may be severe and produce significant loss 
we are also exposed to significant loss from less 
table of contents severe catastrophes when they affect large geographic areas or areas that are heavily populated 
although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines  most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners  allied lines and commercial multi peril coverages 
the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure from tornadoes  hailstorms and earthquakes in the midwest as well as catastrophe exposure from hurricanes affecting the gulf coast and atlantic coast areas  including the southeast  mid atlantic and northeast regions 
see narrative description of business regulation in item of this form k for a discussion regarding our recent personal lines action with respect to florida 
in the last three years  the largest catastrophe or series of catastrophes to affect stfc s results of operations in any one year were as follows with losses from hurricane ike as it travelled through the midwest resulting in approximately million in pre tax losses  with losses from a hail storm in early june causing million in pre tax losses  and with losses from hurricanes katrina and wilma resulting in approximately million in pre tax losses 
we believe that increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured properties and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future 
in addition  states have from time to time passed legislation that limits the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk  such as legislation prohibiting insurers from withdrawing from catastrophe prone areas 
although we attempt to reduce the impact of catastrophes on our business by controlling concentrations of exposures in catastrophe prone areas and through the purchase of reinsurance covering various categories of catastrophes  reinsurance may prove inadequate if a major catastrophic loss exceeds the reinsurance limit  or an insurance subsidiary incurs a number of smaller catastrophes that  individually  fall below the reinsurance retention level 
underwriting and pricing our financial results depend primarily on our ability to underwrite risks effectively and to charge adequate rates to policyholders 
our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks  across a number of lines of insurance 
rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to pay losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
our ability to underwrite and set rates effectively is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation the availability of sufficient  reliable data  our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data  our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to project both the severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy  uncertainties which are generally inherent in estimates and assumptions  our ability to project changes in certain operating expense levels with reasonable certainty  the development  selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies  our use of modeling tools to assist with correctly and consistently achieving the intended results in underwriting and pricing  our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies  and the success of those innovations on implementation  our ability to secure regulatory approval of premium rates on an adequate and timely basis  our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately  
table of contents unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action  unanticipated changes in our claim settlement practices  changing driving patterns for auto exposures  changing weather patterns for property exposures  changes in the medical sector of the economy  unanticipated changes in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices  impact of inflation and other factors on cost of construction materials and labor  our ability to monitor property concentration in catastrophe prone areas  such as hurricane  earthquake and wind hail regions  and the general state of the economy in the states in which we operate 
such risks may result in our rates being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate assumptions or methodologies  and may cause our estimates of future changes in the frequency or severity of claims to be incorrect 
as a result  we could under price risks  which would negatively affect our margins  or we could overprice risks  which could reduce our volume and competitiveness 
in either event  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
reinsurance reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses 
we use reinsurance to help manage our exposure to insurance risks 
the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions  which can affect our business volume and profitability 
although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance  we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured 
ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims 
as a result  we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers 
reinsurance may not be adequate to protect us against losses and may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
in addition  the magnitude of losses in the reinsurance industry resulting from catastrophes may adversely affect the financial strength of certain reinsurers  which may result in our inability to collect or recover reinsurance 
reinsurers also may reserve their right to dispute coverage with respect to specific claims 
with respect to catastrophic or other loss  if we experience difficulty collecting from reinsurers or obtaining additional reinsurance in the future  we will bear a greater portion of the total financial responsibility for such loss  which could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 
cyclical nature of the industry the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  which may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
the property and casualty insurance industry  particularly business insurance  has been historically characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity  as well as periods of shortages of underwriting capacity that result in higher prices and more restrictive contract and or coverage terms 
the periods of intense price competition may adversely affect our operating results  and the overall cyclicality of the industry may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
while we may adjust prices during periods of intense competition  it remains our strategy to allow for acceptable profit levels and to decline coverage in situations where pricing or risk would not result in acceptable returns 
accordingly  our commercial lines business tends to contract during periods of severe competition and price declines and expand when market pricing allows an acceptable return 

table of contents the personal lines businesses are characterized by an auto underwriting cycle of loss cost trends 
driving patterns  inflation in the cost of auto repairs and medical care and increasing litigation of liability claims are some of the more important factors that affect loss cost trends 
inflation in the cost of building materials and labor costs and demand caused by weather related catastrophic events affect personal lines homeowners loss cost trends 
our company and other personal lines insurers may be unable to increase premiums at the same pace as coverage costs increase 
accordingly  profit margins generally decline in periods of increasing loss costs 
current economic conditions the current and future difficult economic conditions can adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the current economic slowdown and any further economic decline in future reporting periods could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
while the volatility of the current economic climate makes it difficult for us to predict the complete impact of this slowdown on our business and results of operations  our business may be impacted in a variety of ways 
the economy is causing consumers and businesses to decrease their spending  which may impact the demand for our insurance products 
for example  declining automotive sales and weaknesses in the housing market generally impact the purchase of our personal auto and homeowners insurance products by consumers and business insurance products by businesses involved in these industries 
as unemployment rates rise  there may be a tendency for the number of workers compensation claims to increase  as laid off and unemployed workers may seek workers compensation benefits to replace their lost health care benefits 
similarly  uninsured and underinsured motorist claims may rise 
the volatility and weakness in the financial and capital markets have negatively impacted  and may continue to negatively impact  the value of our investment portfolio 
we may be adversely affected by business difficulties  bankruptcies and impairments of other parties with whom we do business  such as independent agents  reinsurers or banks  which increases our credit risk and other counterparty risks 
in addition  departments of insurance  taxing authorities and other state and local agencies may seek to impose or increase taxes  assessments and other revenue generating fees in response to funding reductions caused by the current economic downturn 
these actions may increase the cost of doing business in these states 
in response to the current economic conditions  the united states federal government and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking action to address such conditions including  among other things  purchasing mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions  investing directly in banks  thrifts and bank and savings and loan holding companies and increasing federal spending to stimulate the economy 
there can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets  current economic conditions or our company 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may negatively affect our ability to meet unexpected liquidity needs or to obtain credit on acceptable terms 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing significant volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets have negatively affected the availability of liquidity and credit capacity 
in the event that we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses  make payments on our indebtedness  pay for capital expenditures or fund acquisitions  our ability to obtain such capital may be constrained and the cost of any such capital may be significant 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on numerous factors  such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit 
table of contents ratings and credit capacity  as well as lenders perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
our access to funds may also be constrained if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions 
if certain factors were to occur  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms 
distribution system the independent agency system is the distribution system for our products 
use of this distribution system may constrain our ability to grow at a comparable pace to our competitors that utilize multiple distribution channels 
in addition  consumers may prefer to purchase insurance products through alternative channels  such as through the internet  rather than through agents 
we market our insurance products through independent  non exclusive insurance agents  whereas some of our competitors sell their insurance products through direct marketing techniques  the internet or captive insurance agents who sell products exclusively for one insurance company 
the state auto group has supported the independent agency system as our sole distribution channel for the past years 
however  we recognize that although the number of distribution locations has expanded  the number of independent agencies in the industry has dramatically shrunk over the past several years due to agency purchases  consolidations  bankruptcies and agent retirements 
we also recognize that it will be progressively more difficult to expand the number of independent agencies representing us 
if we are unsuccessful in maintaining and increasing the number of agencies in our independent agency distribution system  our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the agents that market and sell our products also sell products of our competitors 
these agents may recommend our competitors products over our products or may stop selling our products altogether 
our strategy of not pursuing market share at prices that are not expected to produce an underwriting profit can have the effect of making top line growth more difficult 
when price competition is intense  this effect is exaggerated by the fact our independent agent distribution force has products to sell from other carriers that may be more willing to lower prices to grow top line sales 
consequently  we must remain focused on attracting and retaining productive agents to market and sell our products 
we compete for productive agents primarily on the basis of our financial position  support services  ease of doing business  compensation and product features 
although we make efforts to ensure we have strong relationships with our independent agents and to persuade them to promote and sell our products  we may not be successful in these efforts 
if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these agents  our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  consumers are increasingly using the internet and other alternative channels to purchase insurance products 
while our website provides a significant amount of information about our insurance products  consumers cannot purchase insurance through our website 
instead  consumers must contact one of our independent agents in order to purchase any of our insurance products or make changes to their existing policies 
this sole distribution system may place us at a disadvantage with consumers who prefer to purchase insurance products online or through other alternative distributions channels 
regulation our business is heavily regulated  and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we conduct business 
this regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders  as opposed to stockholders and other investors  and relates to authorization for lines of business  capital and surplus requirements  investment limitations  underwriting limitations  transactions with affiliates  dividend limitations see narrative description of business regulation dividends in item changes in control  premium rates and a variety of other financial and 
table of contents non financial components of an insurance company s business 
the naic and state insurance regulators are constantly reexamining existing laws and regulations  generally focusing on modifications to holding company regulations  interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws 
from time to time  some states in which we conduct business have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies 
in other situations  states in which we conduct business have considered or enacted laws that impact the competitive environment and marketplace for property and casualty insurance 
for example  in  florida enacted legislation that required us to charge rates for homeowners insurance that we believed were inadequate to cover the related underwriting risk 
after careful analysis of this legislation  we concluded that we could no longer operate our personal lines on a profitable basis in that state 
accordingly  during the second quarter  we filed an application with the florida department of insurance to withdraw from this state s personal lines insurance market effective january  non renewals on our personal lines business occurred throughout we continue to write commercial lines business in florida 
nearly all states require licensed insurers to participate in guaranty funds through assessments covering a portion of insurance claims against impaired or insolvent insurers 
an increase in the magnitude of impaired companies could result in an increase in our share of such assessments 
residual market or pooling arrangements exist in many states to provide certain types of insurance coverage to those that are otherwise unable to find private insurers willing to insure them 
licensed insurers voluntarily writing such coverage are required to participate in these residual markets or pooling mechanisms 
such participation exposes the company to possible assessments  some of which could be material to our results of operations 
the potential availability of recoupments or premium rate increases  if applicable  may not offset such assessments in the financial statements nor do so in the same fiscal periods 
many of the states in which we operate have passed or are considering legislation restricting or banning the use of credit scoring in rating and or risk selection in personal lines of business 
similarly  several states are considering restricting insurers rights to use loss history information maintained in various databases by insurance support organizations 
these tools help us price our products more fairly and enhance our ability to compete for business that we believe will be profitable 
such regulations would limit our ability  as well as the ability of all other insurance carriers operating in any affected jurisdiction  to take advantage of these tools 
currently the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business 
however  in recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny 
congress and some federal agencies from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the united states to determine whether to impose federal regulation or to allow an optional federal charter  similar to banks 
in addition  changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas  including changes in the gramm leach bliley act  financial services regulation and federal taxation  can significantly impact the insurance industry and us 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect any enacted  proposed or future state or federal legislation or naic initiatives may have on the conduct of our business 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the regulatory requirements applicable to our business will not become more stringent in the future or result in materially higher costs than current requirements 
changes in the regulation of our business may reduce our profitability  limit our growth or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
we could be adversely affected if our controls designed to assure compliance with guidelines  policies  and legal and regulatory standards are ineffective 
our business is dependent on our ability to regularly engage in a large number of insurance underwriting  claim processing and investment activities  many of which are complex 
these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies  as well as legal and regulatory requirements 
no matter how well designed and executed  control systems provide only reasonable assurance that the system objectives will be met 
if our controls are not effective  it could lead to financial loss  unexpected risk exposures or damage to our reputation 

table of contents claim and coverage developments developing claim and coverage issues in our industry are uncertain and may adversely affect our insurance operations 
as industry practices and legislative  judicial and regulatory conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may develop 
these issues could have an adverse effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency or severity of claims 
the premiums we charge for our insurance products are based upon certain risk expectations 
when legislative  judicial or regulatory authorities expand the burden of risk beyond our expectations  the premiums we previously charged or collected may no longer be sufficient to cover the risk  and we do not have the ability to retroactively modify premium amounts 
furthermore  our reserve estimates do not take into consideration a major retroactive expansion of coverage through legislative or regulatory actions or judicial interpretations 
in particular  court decisions have had  and are expected to continue to have  significant impact on the property and casualty insurance industry 
court decisions may increase the level of risk which insurers are expected to assume in a number of ways  such as by eliminating exclusions  increasing limits of coverage  creating rights in claimants not intended by the insurer and interpreting applicable statutes expansively to create obligations on insurers not originally considered when the statute was passed 
in some cases  court decisions have been applied retroactively 
court decisions have also negated legal reforms passed by state legislatures 
there is also a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers  including us  in purported class action litigation relating to claim handling and other practices  particularly with respect to the handling of personal lines auto and homeowners claims 
many of these issues are beyond our control 
the effects of these and other unforeseen claims and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could materially harm our business and results of operations 
terrorism terrorist attacks  and the threat of terrorist attacks  and ensuing events could have an adverse effect on us 
terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause loss of life  property damage  reduced economic activity  and additional disruptions to commerce 
actual terrorist attacks could cause losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations of the state auto group  as well as a decrease in our stockholders equity  net income and or revenue 
the terrorism acts require the federal government and the insurance industry to share in insured losses up to billion per year resulting from certain future terrorist attacks within the united states 
under the terrorism acts  we must offer our commercial policyholders coverage against certified acts of terrorism 
in december  the united states congress extended the terrorism acts through december   and made some modest changes to the terrorism acts 
we are evaluating these changes to the terrorism act and are taking actions to comply 
see narrative description of business regulation of this item for a discussion of the terrorism acts 
in addition  some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism  ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures 
we cannot predict at this time whether and the extent to which industry sectors in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of potentially decreased commercial and economic activity  or how any such decrease might impact the ability of companies within the affected industry sectors to pay interest or principal on their securities  or how the value of any underlying collateral might be affected 

table of contents technology and automation our development of business insurance lines automated underwriting tools may not be successful or the benefits may not be realized 
in addition our business success and profitability depend  in part  on effective information technology systems and facilities 
if we are unable to keep pace with the rapidly developing technological advancements in the insurance industry  our ability to compete effectively could be impaired 
we are developing a business insurance agency portal bizxpress sm that will build upon the success we believe we have achieved through our personal insurance agency portal netxpress sm 
our bizxpress allows agents to obtain business insurance quotes for applicants via the internet in real time 
this technology enables our agents to prepare a quote proposal and applications for their prospective customer at the point of sale 
while this represents a significant commitment of resources  we believe it is vitally important to our ability to maintain our prospects in business insurance lines 
such automation was successfully put into production for the business auto product during the first half of in  we expect to complete work on an enhanced businessowners product and begin automation for workers compensation products 
we cannot be sure that the development of this technology will be completed within the projected month timeframe  or that it will be successful upon implementation 
additionally  because some of our competitors have already implemented or may be implementing similar types of technology  we may be competitively disadvantaged 
a challenge during this development phase will be the utilization of today s technology in face of a constantly changing technological landscape 
there can be no assurance that the development of today s technology for tomorrow s use will not result in our being competitively disadvantaged  especially among the larger national carriers that have greater financial and human resources than we 
we depend in large part on our technology systems and facilities for conducting business and processing claims 
our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and facilities and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems and facilities that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost effective manner 
if we are unable to keep pace with the advancements being made in technology  our ability to compete with other insurance companies who have advanced technological capabilities will be negatively affected 
further  if we are unable to update or replace our key legacy systems and facilities as they become obsolete or as emerging technology renders them competitively inefficient  our competitive position and or cost structure could be adversely affected 
investments the performance of our investment portfolios is subject to investment risks 
like other property and casualty insurance companies  we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a portion of our revenues and earnings and are therefore subject to market risk and the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  commodity or foreign currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices 
individual securities in our fixed income portfolio are subject to credit risk 
downgrades in the credit ratings of fixed maturities can have a significant negative effect on the market valuation of such securities 
if the fixed income or equity portfolios  or both  were to be impaired by market  sector or issuer specific conditions to a substantial degree  our liquidity  financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
under these circumstances  our income from these investments could be materially reduced  and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels 
a decrease in value of our investment portfolio could also put our insurance subsidiaries at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements 
if we were not at that time able to supplement our subsidiaries capital from stfc or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms  our business could be materially adversely affected 
also  a decline in market rates could cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation  resulting in additional expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plan 

table of contents in addition  our investments are subject to risks inherent in the nation s and world s capital markets 
the functioning of those markets  the values of the investments held by us and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms or short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local  national or international events  such as power outages  system failures  wars or terrorist attacks or by recessions or depressions  a significant change in inflation expectations  a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit  currencies or financial markets and other factors or events 
changes in tax laws impacting marginal tax rates and or the preferred tax treatment of municipal obligations under current law  could adversely affect the market value of municipal obligations 
since  at fair value  of our investment portfolio at december  is invested in tax exempt municipal obligations  any such changes in tax law could adversely affect the value of the investment portfolio 
additionally  any such changes in tax law could reduce the difference between tax exempt interest rates and taxable rates 
employees our ability to attract  develop and retain talented employees  managers and executives  and to maintain appropriate staffing levels  is critical to our success 
our success depends on our ability to attract  develop and retain talented employees  including executives and other key managers in a specialized industry 
our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we must forecast the changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust hiring programs and or employment levels accordingly 
our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments  or the failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis  could lead either to over staffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or under staffing impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations 
in either event  our financial results could be materially adversely affected 
business continuity our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities  systems and business functions  including our information technology and other business systems 
our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform  in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion  necessary business functions  such as internet support and hour claims contact centers  processing new and renewal business  and processing and paying claims 
a shut down of or inability to access one or more of our facilities  a power outage  a pandemic  or a failure of one or more of our information technology  telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis 
in addition  because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems  we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third party system fails or experiences an interruption 
if sustained or repeated  such a business interruption  systems failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business  provide customer service  pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary corporate functions 
this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results and liquidity 
a security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation 
in addition  we could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our computer systems 
despite the implementation of security measures  including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer infrastructure  these systems may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we have established a business continuity plan in an effort to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal business operations could not be performed due to a catastrophic event 
while we continue to test and assess our business continuity plan to ensure it meets the needs of our core business operations and addresses multiple business interruption events  there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed upon the occurrence of such an event 
acquisitions acquisitions subject us to a number of financial and operational risks 
since going public in  we and state auto mutual have acquired or affiliated with other insurance companies  such as the migi insurers  milbank  farmers  sa wisconsin  and most recently the beacon insurance group and patrons insurance group 
it is anticipated that we and state auto mutual will continue to pursue acquisitions or affiliations of other insurance companies in the future 
acquisitions and affiliations involve numerous risks and uncertainties  such as obtaining necessary regulatory approvals may prove to be more difficult than anticipated  integrating the business may prove to be more costly than anticipated  integrating the business without material disruption to existing operations may prove to be more difficult than anticipated  anticipated cost savings may not be fully realized or not realized within the anticipated time frame  loss results of the acquired or affiliated company or business may be worse than expected  losses may develop differently than what we expected them to  and retaining key employees of the acquired company or business may prove to be more difficult than anticipated 
in addition  other companies in the insurance industry have similar acquisition and affiliation strategies 
competition for target companies or businesses may intensify or we may not be able to complete such acquisitions or affiliations on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
additionally  the costs of unsuccessful acquisition and affiliation efforts may adversely affect our financial performance 
financial strength ratings a downgrade in our financial strength ratings may negatively affect our business 
insurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies 
higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims 
ratings are assigned by rating agencies to insurers based upon factors that they believe are relevant to policyholders and creditors 
ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our company and in our ability to market our products 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could  among other things  negatively affect our ability to sell certain insurance products  our relationships with agents  new sales and our ability to compete 
although other agencies cover the property and casualty industry  we believe our ability to write business is most influenced by our rating from am best 
according to am best  its ratings are designed to assess an insurer s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders 
our pooled companies and sa national currently have a rating from am best company of a superior the second highest of am best s ratings 
we may not be able to maintain our current am best ratings 

table of contents control by our parent company our parent company owns a significant interest in us and may exercise its control in a manner detrimental to your interests 
as of december   our parent company owned approximately of the voting power of our company 
therefore  state auto mutual has the power to direct our affairs and is able to determine the outcome of substantially all matters required to be submitted to stockholders for approval  including the election of all our directors 
state auto mutual could exercise its control over us in a manner detrimental to the interests of other stfc stockholders 
competition our industry is highly competitive  which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
the property and casualty insurance business is highly competitive  and we compete with a large number of other insurers 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations  and substantially greater financial  technical and operating resources and market share than we 
we may not be able to effectively compete  which could adversely affect our sales or profitability 
we believe that competition in our lines of business is based primarily on price  service  commission structure  product features  financial strength ratings  reputation and name or brand recognition 
our competitors sell through various distribution channels  including independent agents  captive agents and directly to the consumer 
we compete not only for business insurance customers and personal insurance customers  but also for independent agents to market and sell our products 
some of our competitors offer a broader array of products  have more competitive pricing or have higher claims paying ability ratings 
in addition  other financial institutions are now able to offer services similar to our own as a result of the gramm leach bliley act 
the increased transparency that arises from information available from the use of tools such as comparative rater software  could work to our disadvantage 
we may have difficulty differentiating our products or becoming among the lowest cost providers 
expense efficiencies are important to maintaining and increasing our growth and profitability 
if we are unable to realize future expense efficiencies  it could affect our ability to establish competitive pricing and could have a negative effect on new business growth and retention of existing policyholders 
volatility of our common stock the price of our common stock could be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors  certain of which may not be related to our operating performance and are beyond our control 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the following variations in our actual or anticipated operating results or changes in the expectations of financial market analysts  investor perceptions of our company and or the property and casualty industry  market conditions in the insurance industry and any significant volatility in the market  and major catastrophic events

the insurance segments distribute their products through the independent agency system across states 
each is managed separately based on the type of customers served  products provided or services offered 
the personal insurance segment provides primarily personal auto standard and nonstandard and homeowners to the personal insurance market 
the business insurance segment provides primarily commercial auto  commercial multi peril  fire and allied lines  other and product liability and workers compensation insurance to small to medium sized businesses within the commercial insurance market 
the investment operations segment  managed by stateco  provides investment services for our company s invested assets 
we evaluate the performance of our insurance segments using industry financial measurements determined based on statutory accounting principles sap  and certain measures determined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we evaluate our investment operations segment based on investment returns of assets managed 
financial information about our segments is set forth in this item and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 

table of contents executive summary the results of our operations from year to year and quarter to quarter are primarily driven by our ability to generate revenue through selecting and pricing risks in a manner that permits premium growth without adversely affecting underwriting profits  and disciplined investment strategy 
we also recognize that our results will be periodically impacted  sometimes significantly  by the occurrence of catastrophic events  which are generally beyond our control 
premium growth underwriting profitability the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical 
our industry has been historically characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity  as well as periods of shortages of underwriting capacity that result in increased prices and more favorable underwriting terms 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  some property and casualty insurers attempt to generate additional top line growth by setting their prices at levels inappropriate for the risk underwritten 
while in the short term this may result in additional revenues  this action compromises their long term underwriting profitability 
our strategy is to insure personal and small to medium business risks while adhering to disciplined and consistent underwriting principles through all market cycles 
over the last several months the industry has been moving from soft market conditions in which insurer competition has been intense and there has been pressure to lower rates toward hard market conditions in which insurers tend to raise prices 
we have been monitoring this situation and have responded in ways consistent with our goals not to compromise underwriting profitability and to protect the interests of our stakeholders 
our underwriting principles include insistence on selecting and retaining business based on the merits of each account and a dedication to cost based pricing  where each line of business is priced to generate a profit 
it is our intention to set pricing levels so that no line of business  or classification within major lines  subsidizes another line or classification 
we are committed to achieving an underwriting profit through all market cycles  even at the expense of periodic slowdowns in written and earned premiums 
we will not compromise underwriting profitability for top line growth 
we believe that we can implement periodic rate changes in most states and remain an attractive market to our policyholders and independent agents by stressing the strengths we bring to the marketplace 
these strengths include stability  financial soundness  prompt and fair claims service  and technology which make it easier for the agent to do business with the state auto group and provide substantial value to our customers 
we carefully monitor writing insurance in states that we believe present difficult legislative  judicial and or regulatory environments for the insurance industry 
investment strategy we have a disciplined approach to our investment strategy that emphasizes the quality of our fixed maturity portfolio  which comprised of our total portfolio at fair value at december   and includes primarily investment grade securities 
the majority of our fixed maturity portfolio is invested in municipal bonds to recognize the tax advantages available from municipal bond income 
in addition  we believe that our credit risk exposure is reduced by investing in high quality municipal bonds that are diversified by issuer and state 
our internally managed equity portfolio  which comprised of our total portfolio at fair value at december   emphasizes large cap  dividend paying companies selected based upon their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
during  we began to diversify our equity portfolio and utilize outside managers to invest in us small cap equities and international funds 
diversifying our portfolio into small cap equities and international funds was designed to achieve a greater total return with reduced volatility 
in almost all of the asset classes experienced a decline in fair value  and our portfolio was not immune to this broad based decline 
we believe that in most market cycles diversification of our portfolio will be beneficial to us and we plan to continue to maintain a diversified portfolio 
loss reserves we maintain reserves for the eventual payment of losses and loss expenses for both reported claims and incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
loss reserves are management s best estimate at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to settle all claims incurred as of the end of the accounting period  based on facts  circumstances and historical trends then known 
although 
table of contents management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is no precise method for determining the ultimate liability 
we do not discount loss reserves for financial statement purposes 
our objective is to set reserves that are adequate such that the amounts originally recorded as reserves reasonably approximate the ultimate liability for insured losses and loss expenses 
we regularly review and adjust loss reserves as appropriate 
catastrophic events we are exposed to claims arising out of catastrophic events 
catastrophe losses can and do cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural events  including hurricanes  hailstorms  tornadoes  windstorms  earthquakes  severe winter weather and fires  none of which are within our control 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the magnitude of loss from a catastrophe is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposure in the affected area 
catastrophes  to which we are exposed  including hurricanes  earthquakes and other perils  may be severe and produce significant loss 
we are also exposed to significant loss from less severe catastrophes when they affect large geographic areas or areas that are heavily populated although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines  most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners  allied lines and commercial multiple peril coverages 
we deploy specific strategies designed to mitigate our exposure to catastrophe losses  which include obtaining reinsurance 
we continually seek to diversify our business on a geographic basis 
the number of states we actively operate in has increased from states in to states as of december  as we begin  the concentration of our direct written premiums for our property and casualty operations in our largest five states has decreased from for the year ended december   to approximately at december  our catastrophe management strategies are designed to mitigate our exposure to earthquakes and hurricanes 
in addition to our adherence to our cost based pricing  investment and catastrophe risk mitigation strategies discussed above  our management focuses on several other key areas with the intention of continually improving the results of our operations and financial results  including the following claims service we believe an important element of our success is our focus on claims service 
we expect our claim service to be fair  fast and friendly 
the role of the claims division is to deliver the promise that we and the independent agent made to the insured 
we have the capability of receiving claims hours a day  seven days a week 
claims may be reported to our claims contact center  to the policyholder s independent agent or via the internet at www 
stateauto 
com 
we make a pledge to our policyholders to try and make contact with them within two hours of a claim being assigned to a claims handler except in catastrophe loss situations 
in addition  we established internal claims catastrophe teams to enhance our response to policyholders in these loss situations 
independent insurance agent network we offer our products through over  agencies in states 
we believe the success of our independent insurance agent network  which is our only distribution channel  grows out of our commitment to promote and foster close working relationships with our agents 
we seek relationships with agencies where we will be one of their top three insurers  measured on the basis of direct premiums written  for the type of business we desire 
our agents compensation package includes competitive commission rates and other sales inducements designed to maintain and enhance relationships with existing independent agents as well as to attract new independent agents 
we provide our agents with a co operative advertising program  sales training programs  contingent commissions  travel incentives and agency recognition 
we continually monitor our agencies for compatibility with us  taking into account factors such as loss ratio  premium volume  business profiles and relationship history 
this allows us to be proactive in helping our agents grow their book of business with us profitably and  thus  enhance the long term value of our relationship 
our senior management meets frequently with agents to encourage mutual growth and demonstrate our commitment 
we believe each of these elements creates a relationship that has resulted in our independent insurance agents placing quality insurance business with us 

table of contents technology our technology efforts are focused on making us as efficient and effective as possible 
our personal insurance segment technology has leveraged past successes with our netxpress sm agency portal by providing more integration with the systems our independent agents commonly use in their offices 
this integration of data directly into our netxpress portal eliminates the re keying effort for our agents and at the same time increases the quality of that data 
we have also streamlined the way we acquire outside information like motor vehicle reports and address based information so that our technology can provide fast and accurate quotes 
our independent agents have welcomed this functionality and rewarded us with increased quote opportunities and submissions 
in  our business insurance segment increased the functionality of our bizxpress sm portal  by adding support for another line of business 
our independent agents who issue business auto policies can now accurately quote and produce proposals for their clients 
in addition  during our independent agents benefited from the addition of more robust reports to analyze claims data for their insureds 
these reports are easily requested via the agent s portal 
during the course of  improvements in our project management  quality assurance  and it governance all improved our technology efficiency and effectiveness 
these improvements help us maximize the business results we ultimately receive from our technology investments 
innovate sa in the last two quarters of  we launched a formal company wide plan called innovate sa  which is intended to reduce expenses  enhance revenues and improve margins 
innovate sa is comprised of various initiatives  including changes to our field structure  business processes and product changes 
innovate sa began with an idea generation phase that involved our associates and was followed by an evaluation phase that was led by senior managers in our business units 
the idea generation and evaluation phases were completed for the most part in the fourth quarter of  and separate actions have been approved for implementation 
our expectation is that implementation will take place over the next three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet  revenues and expenses for the period then ended and the financial entries in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future  as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in this item we have identified the policies and estimates described below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of our operations 
investments our fixed maturity  equity security and certain other invested asset investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss  and as such are not included in the determination of net income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary impaired otti  an assessment which requires significant management judgment regarding the evidence known 
such judgments could change in the future as more information becomes known which could negatively impact the amounts reported herein 
we consider many factors when assessing our investments for otti which include the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events that may influence the issuer s operations  the length of time and or the depth of decline below cost  our ability and intent to hold the security through its near term recovery period  and the ability of the fair value to recover to cost in 
table of contents the near term 
when a security in our investment portfolio has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not reversed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income or loss 
fair value measurements on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which was issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in september for financial statement elements currently required to be measured at fair value  sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new definition of fair value focuses on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability exit price regardless of whether an observable liquid market price exists 
an exit price valuation includes margins for risk even if the margins are not observable 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques which are used to measure fair value into three broad levels as defined below level includes observable inputs which reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date 
level includes observable inputs for assets or liabilities other than quoted prices included in level and it includes valuation techniques which use prices for similar assets and liabilities 
level includes unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk 
deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes and certain underwriting expenses relating to the production of property and casualty business  are deferred and amortized over the same period in which the related premiums are earned 
the method followed for computing the acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
in determining estimated realizable value  the computation gives effect to the premium to be earned  losses and loss expenses expected to be incurred  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as premium is earned 
these amounts are based on estimates  and accordingly  the actual realizable value may vary from the estimated realizable value 
losses and loss expenses payable losses and loss expenses payable are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to settle all claims incurred as of the end of the accounting period  based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined by claims adjusters based on our reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and applicable policy provisions 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months are case reserved at that time 
loss and loss expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported ibnr are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
the process for calculating ibnr is to develop an estimate of the ultimate 
table of contents losses incurred  and subtract all amounts already paid or held as formula or case reserves 
although we use many internal and external resources  as well as multiple established methodologies to calculate ibnr  there is no method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
for a further discussion regarding our losses and loss expense reserves and our reserving methods see other loss and loss expense reserves included in this item pension and postretirement benefit obligations pension and postretirement benefit obligations are long term in nature and require management s judgment in estimating the factors used to determine these amounts 
we review these factors annually  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
because these obligations are based on estimates which could change  the ultimate benefit obligation could be different from the amount estimated 
for a further discussion regarding our pension and postretirement benefit obligations see other employee benefit plans included in this item share based compensation we have share based compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options  restricted stock and restricted share units to employees and non employee directors 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant or each reporting date and amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant or each reporting date using the black scholes closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the option and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life of the option  which significantly impacts the assumed fair value 
we use historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future periods 
other other items that could have a significant impact on the financial statements include the risks and uncertainties listed in item a of this form k under risk factors 
actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 

table of contents results of operations summary the following table summarizes certain key performance indicators used to manage our operations for the years ended december   and  respectively millions  except per share data gaap basis total revenues net loss income stockholders equity book value per share debt to capital ratio loss and lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio catastrophe loss and lae points premium written growth premium earned growth investment yield sap basis loss and lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio net premiums written to surplus see compared to section below for definitions 
points of the increase for is related to the one time million transfer of unearned premium to us on january   in conjunction with the pooling change 
the sap loss and lae ratio is losses and loss expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums 
the sap expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses and miscellaneous expenses offset by miscellaneous income underwriting expenses as a percentage of net written premiums 
the sap combined ratio is the sum of the sap loss and lae ratio and the sap expense ratio 
we use the statutory net premiums written to surplus ratio because there is no comparable gaap measure 
this ratio  also called the leverage ratio  measures our statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
compared to for  we reported a pre tax loss of million compared to pre tax income of million for our pre tax loss was primarily driven by the following factors catastrophe losses for were million or loss ratio points compared to million or loss ratio points for the same period

table of contents insurance segments insurance industry regulators require our insurance subsidiaries to report their financial condition and results of operations using sap 
we use sap financial results  along with industry standard financial measures determined on a sap basis and certain measures determined on a gaap basis  to internally monitor the performance of our insurance segments and reward our employees 
the more common financial measures used are loss and lae ratio  underwriting expense ratio  combined ratio  net premiums written and net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
when the combined ratio is less than  the insurer is operating at an underwriting gain and when it is greater than  the insurer is operating at an underwriting loss 
underwriting gain loss is determined by subtracting from net earned premiums  losses and loss expenses and underwriting expenses 
one of the more significant differences between gaap and sap is that sap requires all underwriting expenses to be expensed immediately and not deferred over the same period that the premium is earned 
in converting sap underwriting results to gaap underwriting results  acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the periods the related written premiums are earned 
for a discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs see critical accounting policies deferred acquisition costs section included in this item the gaap combined ratio is defined as the sum of the gaap loss and lae ratio loss and loss expenses as a percentage of earned premiums plus gaap expense ratio acquisition and operating expenses as a percentage of earned premiums 
all references to financial measures or components thereof in this discussion are calculated on a gaap basis  unless otherwise noted

table of contents revenue we measure our top line growth for our insurance segments based on net written premiums  which represent the premiums on the policies we have issued for a period  net of reinsurance 
net written premiums provide us with an indication of how well we are doing in terms of revenue growth before it is actually earned 
our policies provide a fixed amount of coverage for a stated period of time  often referred to as the policy term 
as such  our written premiums are recognized as earned ratably over the policy term 
the unearned portion of written premiums  called unearned premiums  is reflected on our balance sheet as a liability and represents our obligation to provide coverage for the unexpired terms of the policies 
the following table shows the reconciliation of the one time impact on net written premiums for the year ended december  with respect to the unearned premiums transferred to us on january   in conjunction with the pooling change

our third party excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance program  which renewed july  coverage period july  through june   incorporates a reinstatement provision should a loss occurrence exceed our retention 
under this provision  our original reinsurance coverage limits are automatically restored in consideration of an additional reinstatement premium reinstatement premium 
the estimated direct ultimate loss resulting from hurricane ike exceeded our retention  thereby causing two premium transactions to occur an acceleration of the recognition of the original annual premium to the date of loss occurrence in proportion to the reinsurance coverage exhausted and the recognition of the reinstatement premium from the date of the loss occurrence to the end of the coverage period june  
additionally  during the fourth quarter we entered into a separate property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement third event agreement  which provides additional coverage in excess of our retention through our remaining coverage period 
table of contents june  
the incremental impact of the acceleration of the original annual premium plus the recognition reinstatement premium plus the premium paid in connection with the third event agreement resulted in million less net written and earned premiums within our property lines when compared to the same period 
the incremental impact has the most significant effect on our property lines 
see detailed discussion of our reinsurance programs in the liquidity and capital resources reinsurance arrangements section included in this item personal insurance segment revenue our personal insurance segment consists primarily of auto standard and nonstandard and homeowners products  with personal auto representing of our total consolidated net written premium in and our strategy to grow our personal lines business includes introducing our products  enhanced systems and easier to use technologies into new states 
during  we began introducing our personal lines products and technologies into texas through the independent agent distribution channel as a result of state auto mutual s acquisition of the beacon insurance group in early in addition  future plans include leveraging our relationship with the patrons insurance group distribution channel to add upgraded product lines and technologies into connecticut 
during  we continued to enhance our personal lines point of sale portal  netxpress 
the additional integration with the systems commonly used by our independent agents has resulted in an increase in the number of quotes for personal auto and homeowners 
in  for the state auto group  quotes were handled on netxpress with  of those quotes initiated from the integration mentioned above 
in  a total of  quotes were handled on netxpress 
we have also focused on improving our policyholders ease of doing business with respect to bill payment and claim reporting and settlement

table of contents in total  the personal insurance segment net written premium increased from by  with of this increase attributed to the new pool business and of this attributed to organic growth 
we define organic growth in this form k as premium growth excluding premium growth related to the new pool business 
our organic growth for net written premiums has been impacted by our decision in to withdraw our personal insurance products from florida beginning january  the net written premium loss from this action was million for standard personal auto net written premiums increased from the new pool business contributed for  while organic growth increased from the primary product contributing to our increase in organic growth in standard personal auto is our customfit sm product which uses a multivariate rating approach that broadens the underwriting and eligibility guidelines for new and existing customers 
since introducing the first generation of the customfit product in  we now offer this product in most of our operating states and have seen significant improvement in our net written premiums production trends for new business in these states 
in late  we began introducing the second generation of customfit and during we continued migrating customfit states to the second generation product which increases the number of pricing points significantly 
we believe independent agents value ease of doing business and make it an important factor in their choice of insurance companies when quoting personal auto products to their customers 
to assist in this area  in early  we began implementing comparative rating tools which allow agents to receive rate quotes from multiple insurance companies by entering the rating information only one time 
to date  we have implemented different integration points to our personal lines rating engine thus eliminating duplicate entry for agents 
we believe agents will quote and write more personal standard and nonstandard auto and homeowners insurance with us as a result of a more efficient quoting process combined with more competitive rates resulting from the ongoing introduction of customfit for standard auto and refined pricing for nonstandard auto 
nonstandard auto net written premium decreased from this decrease was due to tightening underwriting controls and aggressive rate actions which contributed to a decline in our new business writings 
these actions were taken to drive an improvement in our underwriting results 
see sap loss and lae ratios table in the losses and expenses section included in this item homeowners net written premium increased from the new pool business contributed while organic growth increased from we have undertaken new homeowners pricing and product initiatives  such as various new home discounts that complement our customfit automobile rollout  in order to improve our premium growth 
during  we experienced premium growth in most of our states 
other personal net written premium increased from  with coming from organic growth and from new pool business 
other personal includes primarily our farmowners line of business where we expanded into four new states  which accounts for much of the organic growth in this line 

table of contents business insurance segment revenue we focus our business insurance sales on small to medium sized exposures and offer a broad range of both property and liability coverages such as commercial auto  commercial multi peril  fire and allied lines  products liability and workers compensation

we are seeking to balance our traditional underwriting discipline with new products and pricing tools that support the production of profitable new business 
we continue to invest in products  processes and systems that we believe will increase our business insurance writings 
we have expanded our marketability by introducing new products  enhancing existing products and broadening eligibility 
for our property and liability business  we have also implemented a more granular pricing process that we believe will help us price risks more accurately and improve account retention 
we are pursuing the same for our commercial auto and workers compensation lines of business 
in addition  we have broadened our property  liability  auto and workers compensation pricing ranges to better recognize the spectrum of risks within our markets 
this year  we introduced an enhanced employment practices liability product to agents in all states and added enhanced functionality for agents to perform more detailed loss analysis on their existing book of business insurance policies 
in addition  we introduced our workers compensation products into west virginia  which opened this market to private insurers after operating for years as a monopolistic workers compensation state 
we also continue to improve our back office systems  such as enhancements to our insurance policy administration system  to make it easier for agents to quote and submit business insurance policies to us 
our system now allows transactions to be processed throughout the day using real time and straight through 
table of contents processing rather than in a large batch at night 
in addition to the efficiency gains we have achieved for internal employees  we have leveraged this real time and straight through processing functionality with bizxpress 
in  we expanded our bizxpress functionality by giving agents the ability to quote business auto policies as well as businessowners policies  a capability which we introduced to them in we are working to expand the scope of this technology for new products and additional lines of business including workers compensation 
we believe this technology investment should better position us for revenue growth opportunities in the future and start to drive efficiencies into our business model much like we have seen in personal insurance 
the majority of all transactions in business insurance utilize the straight through processing technology 
this has resulted in faster delivery of policies to our agents and their insureds for new business and endorsements 
similar to our personal lines segment  we are leveraging our relationship with the agency distribution channel as a result of state auto mutual s acquisition of beacon national in early during the fourth quarter of we introduced our business product portfolio in texas 
in the fourth quarter of  we began to leverage our relationship with the patrons mutual and litchfield agency distribution channel by completing all filing and systems work to support the introduction of commercial property  liability  auto and workers compensation products  which we introduced to connecticut agents early in loss and lae our gaap loss and lae ratio was in compared to in the increase in the gaap loss and lae ratio was largely due to an increase in catastrophe storm losses 
our catastrophe losses  which primarily impacted our property lines of business  accounted for points of the loss and lae ratio in compared to only points in our non catastrophe loss and lae ratio was in compared to in the increase in our non catastrophe loss and lae ratio was driven mostly by bodily injury claim severity in the personal and commercial auto lines 
with auto lines representing a significant portion of our earned premiums  this line of business contributed roughly of the increase in our non catastrophe ratio 
losses and loss expenses for a calendar year represent the combined estimated ultimate liability for claims occurring in the current calendar year along with any change in estimated ultimate liability for claims occurring in prior years

in addition  in  competitive market conditions limited our ability to obtain price increases in standard auto

table of contents the business insurance segment s non cat loss ratio for was points higher than in the intense competition in the business insurance segment continues to impact our ability to implement price increases  and contributed significantly to the increase in our non cat loss ratio 
for commercial auto  rate decreases were the primary drivers of the increase in our non cat loss ratio 
for other products liability  the increase in loss ratio was driven by development of losses from prior accident years and  to a lesser extent  rate decreases 
for fire allied lines and workers compensation  the increase in loss ratio was primarily due to an increase in the severity of current year claims 
loss and loss expenses payable by major line of business as of december  and and at january  as a result of the pooling change  are shown in the following table millions december  december  january  change personal insurance segment standard auto nonstandard auto homeowners other personal total personal business insurance segment commercial auto commercial multi peril fire allied lines product other liability workers compensation other business total business total losses and loss expenses payable  net of reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses payable the december  loss and loss expenses payable balance has been adjusted for comparative purposes to reflect the loss and loss expenses payable assumed by us on january  from the pooling change 
calculated based on december  change from january  as shown in the table above  there was a million increase in total loss and loss expense reserves during the increase relates primarily to higher levels of reserves for catastrophe losses largely related to hurricane ike and an increase in reserves corresponding to our organic growth 
we conduct periodic reviews of loss development reports and make judgments in determining the reserves for ultimate losses and loss expenses payable 
several factors are considered by us when estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure changes  anticipated inflation  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  late reported claims  and other reasonableness tests 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in our estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience different from historical data  trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 

table of contents acquisition and operating expenses our gaap expense ratio was in compared to in the gaap expense ratio was negatively impacted by approximately points related to our launching of innovate sa  previously discussed  and the actions we took to reduce headcount 
in addition  during the fourth quarter we offered eligible associates an early retirement option as well as reducing staff by almost people 
see other benefit plans section included in this item for further discussion regarding our early retirement option 
combining the early retirement option  reduction in staff and not replacing open positions  we plan to reduce our headcount by approximately positions by the end of the second quarter 
the gaap expense ratio was positively impacted from by a decrease in our variable compensation programs for both our associates and agents 
these programs are directly related to our loss experience which  as previously discussed  was worse in when compared to investment operations segment our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other members of the state auto group are managed by our subsidiary  stateco 
the investment committee the committee of the board of directors establishes the investment policies to be followed by stateco 
at december   our investments in fixed maturities  equity securities and certain other invested assets were held as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are included as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss and as such are not included in the determination of net income loss 
our primary investment objectives are to generate income  preserve capital and maintain adequate liquidity for the payment of claims and expenses 
our current investment strategy does not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have investment policy guidelines with respect to purchasing fixed maturity investments for our insurance subsidiaries which preclude investments in bonds that are rated below investment grade by a recognized rating service 
for the insurance subsidiaries  the maximum investment in any single note or bond is limited to or less of statutory assets  other than obligations of the us government or government agencies  for which there is no limit 
our fixed maturity portfolio is composed of high quality  investment grade issues  comprised almost entirely of debt issues rated aaa or aa 
at december   fixed maturity investments rated below investment grade accounted for less than of our total available for sale investment portfolio 
at december  and  our only investments in asset backed securities were in federal agency pools fannie mae and freddie mac and government guaranteed pools ginnie mae 
our internally managed equity portfolio invests in us large cap  dividend paying companies across many different industries selected based upon their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
this diversification across companies and industries reduces volatility in the value of the large cap equity portfolio 
in addition  our investment policy guidelines limit the purchase of a specific stock to no more than of the market value of the stock at the time of purchase  and no single equity holding should exceed of the total equity portfolio 
our externally managed equity portfolios invest in us small cap equities and international funds 
these managers are permitted to manage the portfolios according to their own respective portfolio objectives 
in selecting our outside investment managers we confirm that their portfolio objectives  including risk tolerance  are acceptable to us 
however  there may be slight differences in their objectives with respect to dividend payments and other constraints that we apply to our large cap equity holdings 
diversifying our portfolio into small cap equities and international funds was designed to achieve a greater total return with reduced volatility 
in almost all asset classes experienced a decline in value and our 
table of contents portfolio was not immune to this broad based decline 
we believe that in most market cycles  diversification of the portfolio will be beneficial to us and we plan to continue to maintain a diversified portfolio 
the following table indicates our target asset allocation as approved by the committee cash and cash equivalents core fixed maturities treasury inflation protected securities large cap equities small cap equities international funds total portfolio composition of investment portfolio as funds become available  either through cash flow from operations  maturities or sales of investments  our objective is to allocate funds to help us achieve our targeted asset allocations over the long term 
the following table provides a breakdown of our investment portfolio relative to our targeted allocated percentages at december  as concerns began to arise in the market place in the last half of we took a more conservative approach to preserve higher cash balances than our targeted allocation 
as we observed markets weakening  we began holding higher cash balances to avoid selling assets at depressed prices for any cash needs that might arise in the course of business  which included settling the claim activity associated with the catastrophes previously discussed 
consequently  cash balances at year end were somewhat higher than the target 
additionally  approximately million is held at the holding company level for state auto financial obligations and will remain in short term funds

at december   our equity portfolio consisted of approximately different large cap stocks and small cap stocks 
the largest single position was of the equity portfolio based on fair value and the top ten positions account for of the equity portfolio 
since our equity portfolio consists primarily of large cap value oriented stocks  with a small allocation to small cap equities  when large cap stocks and or value oriented stocks perform well our equity portfolio typically performs well compared to benchmarks 
conversely  when growth stocks outperform value and or small to mid cap stocks outperform large cap stocks  our equity portfolio does not perform as well compared to benchmarks

table of contents market risk our decision to make a specific investment is influenced primarily by the following factors a investment risks  b general market conditions  c relative valuations of investment instruments  d general market interest rates  e our liquidity requirements at any given time  and f our current federal income tax position and relative spread between after tax yields on tax exempt and taxable fixed maturity investments 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in market prices for equity securities and changes in interest rates and credit ratings for fixed maturity securities 
our fixed maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk whereby the value of the securities varies as market interest rates change 
we manage this risk by closely monitoring the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
the table below summarizes our interest rate risk and shows the effects of a parallel change in interest rates on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio excluding other debt securities as of december  fair value millions change in interest rates bps value as of original value this table summarizes only the effects that a parallel change in interest rates could have on the fixed maturity portfolio 
this change in rates would also change the value of our liabilities and possibly other financial assets 
we caution the reader that this analysis does not take into account nonparallel changes in interest rates 
it is likely that some rates would increase or decrease more than others depending upon market conditions at the time of the change 
this nonparallel change would alter the value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the analysis is also limited in that it does not take into account any actions that might be taken by us in response to these changes 
as a result  the actual impact of a change in interest rates and the resulting fixed maturity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
we believe that the fixed maturity portfolio s exposure to credit risk is minimal as greater than of the bonds we own are rated aa or better and the remaining bonds are rated a 
we do not intend to change our investment policy on the quality of our fixed maturity investments 
the fixed maturity portfolio is managed in a laddered maturity style and considers business mix and liability payout patterns to ensure adequate cash flow to meet claims as they are presented 
we also manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances  owning some agency and us treasury securities at all times  purchasing bonds of major issuers  and purchasing bonds that are part of a medium or large issue 
the fixed maturity portfolio does not have any direct exposure to either exchange rate risk or commodity risk 
we do not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
to provide us greater flexibility in order to manage our market risk exposures  we categorize our fixed maturities as available for sale 
we do not maintain a trading portfolio 
we have no direct exposure to lehman brothers holdings inc or its subsidiaries  american international group inc  and no exposure to the common or preferred shares of federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  or federal national mortgage associations fannie mae 
our exposure to freddie mac and fannie mae is limited to senior debt issues and mortgage backed pools  which amount to less than of invested assets  with no impairments anticipated as a result 
we have no asset backed securities in our fixed maturity portfolio which may be labeled sub prime mortgage backed securities 
we only invest in conventional mortgage backed securities issued by a federal agency or that are us government guaranteed 
specifically  approximately million or of our available for sale investment portfolio as of december   were in either ginnie mae pools  which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government  or fannie mae or freddie mac pools 
in both fannie mae and freddie mac received additional us government backing when they were placed into conservatorship 

table of contents our fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included securities issued by numerous municipalities with a total carrying value of  million 
approximately million or of these securities were enhanced by third party insurance the credit enhancement for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
the downgrade of credit ratings of insurers of these securities could result in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities to the underlying rating of the respective security without giving effect to the benefit of the credit enhancement 
credit enhancement is not a primary consideration to us when purchasing a municipal security as we consider the underlying credit rating of the security by moody s and s p as a more important factor in our evaluation process 
of the total  million of municipal securities in our investment portfolio at december   approximately were rated aa or better  without the benefit of a credit enhancement 
we do not believe that a loss of a credit enhancement would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as our ability and intent to hold the securities 
we believe our municipal bond portfolio muni portfolio is well diversified by issuer and state 
no single issuer comprises more than of the portfolio and no more than of the portfolio is concentrated in any one state 
we believe our muni portfolio is invested within the strongest sectors of the municipal bond market 
we have approximately invested in securities which have been either pre refunded or escrowed to maturity bonds 
approximately of our municipal bonds are general obligation bonds or other tax backed bonds 
the majority of the remaining muni portfolio consists of revenue bonds 
our credit research is an important part of our investment management process and we continually monitor all holdings for any signs of deterioration 
we believe that our municipal holdings will maintain their high credit quality and that the issuers will be able to make all principal and interest payments as they come due 
as of december   our large cap equity portfolio had a beta of using the s p index as a benchmark 
beta estimates the degree the portfolio s price will fluctuate based on a given movement in the market index 
the table below reflects what changes might occur in the value of the large cap equity portfolio given a change in the s p index fair value millions change in s p index value as of original value the above analysis is limited in that it does not take into account any actions that might be taken by us in response to these changes 
as a result  the actual impact of a change in equity market prices and the resulting equity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
by investing in mostly large cap issues we hope to limit liquidity risk in the equity portfolio 
the equity portfolio does not have any direct exposure to exchange rate risk since we do not directly hold any foreign stocks 
we constantly monitor the equity portfolio holdings for any credit risk issues that may arise 
we do not invest in any commodity futures or commodity oriented mutual funds 

table of contents at december   we have two international funds  fund and fund  which are included in other invested assets available for sale 
fund and fund had betas of and  respectively  using the msci eafe index as a benchmark

the million of realized losses for include the recognition of realized losses from sales activity of million 
we recognized realized losses on the sale of certain equity positions within the consumer  manufacturing and financial services sectors due to announced changes in business conditions which  in our opinion  greatly diminished future business prospects 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio for declines in value that are otti  an assessment which requires significant management judgment regarding the evidence known 
such judgments could change in the future as more information becomes known which could negatively impact the amounts reported herein 
we consider many factors when assessing our investments for otti which include the financial condition of the issuer  including any specific events that may influence the issuer s operations  the length of time and or the depth of decline below cost  our ability and intent to hold the security through its near term recovery period  and the ability of the fair value to recover to cost in the near term 
we recognized otti charges on our externally managed small cap equity portfolio and a segment of our large cap portfolio where we are unable to make the assertion regarding our intent to hold these securities that are currently valued below cost until recovery in the near term 
when a security in our investment portfolio has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not reversed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income

 fair value measurements sfas  which was issued by the fasb in september for financial statement elements currently required to be measured at fair value  sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new definition of fair value focuses on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability exit price regardless of whether an observable liquid market price exists 
an exit price valuation will include margins for risk even if they are not observable 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques which are used to measure fair value into three broad levels as defined below level includes observable inputs which reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date 
level includes observable inputs for assets or liabilities other than quoted prices included in level and it includes valuation techniques which use prices for similar assets and liabilities 
level includes unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk

the valuation allowance was allocated million to deferred tax expense associated with our otti realized investment losses recognized in the income statement and million against the unrealized holding losses on equity securities recognized through accumulated other comprehensive loss  a component of equity 
in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our net deferred tax asset 
the million portion of the valuation allowance reflected in the income statement had the effect of decreasing the effective tax rate benefit by percent 
no valuation allowance was held at december  compared to income before federal income tax decreased million to million from the most significant factors contributing to this decrease related to a decline in our revenues  specifically our premiums  and an increase in our loss and loss expenses

while a modest increase  it does represent an improvement from which declined approximately from in particular  competition remains intense within the personal auto market  which is contributing to our overall modest growth 
it remains our strategy that rates be risk based  reflecting the underlying loss and expense trends 
net written premiums for our standard auto products decreased in compared to the competitive marketplace combined with some rate reductions in contributed to this result 
however  we have seen increasing new business production related to the introduction of our customfit product into new states 
customfit uses a multi variate rating approach that broadens the underwriting eligibility for new customers 
in  we began introducing the second generation of customfit  which further improves our rating sophistication 
net written premiums for nonstandard personal auto increased in compared to this represents a significant improvement compared to the premium result which declined from targeted rate decreases coupled with the introduction of new discounts and an increased marketing effort contributed to an increased level of new policy submissions  leading to an increase in premiums 
we believe independent agents value ease of doing business and make it an important factor in their choice of insurance companies when quoting personal auto products to their customers 
during  we introduced in states various real time comparative rating tools which can be used by our independent agents to prepare comparative rate quotes from multiple insurance companies by entering the rating information once 
we believe our independent agents will quote and write more personal standard and nonstandard auto with us as a result of a more efficient quoting process 

table of contents homeowners net written premium increased in compared to in  we introduced a home purchase discount and expanded our age of dwelling discounts to help attract new business which we believe contributed favorably to increased new homeowners policy submission levels 
during  we continued to enhance our personal lines point of sale portal  netxpress  by adding several new integration options with a variety of third party tools used by our independent agents including a joint credit ordering tool  integrated report ordering  and the comparative rating tools mentioned above 
we also have added a number of internal integration points through the use of web services technology 
one example of this is real time integration with our enterprise billing system to provide accurate installment information via netxpress 
the goal of these technology investments is to streamline quoting and policy issuance for our agents 
we strive to be their carrier of choice and ease of doing business is a major driver toward that goal 
we have also focused on improving our policyholders ease of doing business with respect to bill payment and claim reporting and settlement 
in  we expanded our premium payment options to include credit and debit card via www 
stateauto 
com 
in  we deployed an interactive voice response ivr solution to accept premium payments over the phone providing yet another option for policyholders 
the ivr solution provides a more efficient business process for our payment services department and is expected to drive better policy retention results 
during  nearly  payments were made through self service technologies such as these representing over million of premium payments 
additionally  we recently completed several strategic initiatives to enhance our claims handling ability and better manage major catastrophes 
field claims personnel are now equipped with mobile devices that permit adjusting property claims at the loss site 
we believe that our professional claims service backed by reliable technology will continue to distinguish us from our competitors 
during the second quarter  we filed an application with the florida department of insurance to withdraw from the state s personal lines insurance market effective january  after a careful analysis of recent regulatory changes in florida  we concluded that we could no longer operate our personal lines on a profitable basis in that state 
non renewals on this business are in process 
we will continue to write commercial lines business in florida 
during  we wrote million of personal lines premium in florida 

table of contents business insurance segment revenue we focus our business insurance sales on small to medium sized exposures and offer a broad range of both property and liability coverages such as commercial auto  commercial multi peril  fire and allied lines  products liability and workers compensation

we are seeking to balance our traditional underwriting discipline with new products and pricing tools that support the production of profitable new business 
in  we began offering our business products in two new states colorado and texas and increased the number of business products offered in arizona 
we also continue to enhance our back office systems which enable us to more effectively support our independent agents 
we recently implemented the technology to provide real time functionality in our business insurance policy administration systems for quote and issuance transactions 
also known as straight through processing stp  our associates are now able to more effectively and accurately handle typical business insurance processing 
the policy service time has been greatly reduced as a result of this new technology 
to make it easier for our agents to submit business insurance accounts  in  we introduced bizxpress  our web based quote and issuance system  to agents in all of our operating states except florida 
we currently utilize bizxpress for businessowners policies 
we are working to expand bizxpress functionality to our business auto products in the first half of  while we develop the same functionality for workers compensation business for introduction at a later date 
this has been a highly collaborative initiative that has included agent focus group input throughout the project lifecycle 
it also leverages the stp technology investment mentioned above 
we believe this technology investment should better position us for revenue growth opportunities in the future and start to drive efficiencies into our business model much like we have seen in personal insurance 

table of contents losses and expenses our gaap loss and lae ratio was in compared to in loss results for the year have been mixed 
our core auto personal and business and other and product liability lines continue to perform well 
on the property side  catastrophe losses for were lower than in  but we experienced significantly higher frequency of large fire losses within our personal and business lines during the following table presents the provision for losses and loss expenses for those claims occurring in the current calendar year and prior years  along with the gaap loss and lae ratio for the years and  respectively millions gaap loss and lae gaap loss and lae provision for losses and loss expenses occurring current year prior years total losses and loss expenses a tabular presentation of the million favorable development broken down by accident year is shown below

the favorable development of million in came primarily from accident years the more notable items contributing to the development are favorable development at the product level is primarily from the auto liability and other liability lines  where current loss projections using more mature claim data resulted in lower expected average claim severities than past projections 
the impact is approximately million for these two lines combined 
adjusting and other expense reserves accounted for approximately million of prior year reserve change 
these expense reserves have a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held 
table of contents reserves by accident year  as they move up or down in relation to carried loss reserves 
since reserves decreased for the prior accident years  the expense reserves declined in a similar fashion 
allocated loss adjustment expenses alae are those costs that can be related to a specific claim  which may include attorney fees  external claims adjusters and investigation costs  among others 
unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae are those costs incurred in settling claims  such as in house processing costs  for which no identification can be made to specific claims 
adjusting and other expenses are the components of alae and ulae that relate to costs other than defense  litigation  and medical cost containment 
we hold ceded loss reserves in anticipation of transferring liabilities to reinsurers and other pools and associations 
ceded loss reserves were above previously anticipated levels by approximately million 
historically  we have had less ceded loss activity because our reinsurance retention levels are generally high enough to exclude most claims 
this favorable development occurred primarily in the fire  auto liability and workers compensation lines 
favorable catastrophe loss development of approximately million is attributable to the accident year 
this development occurred primarily within our homeowners  other personal and commercial multi peril lines of business 
the remaining favorable development is spread across several lines of business and is generally the result of having fewer claims emerge and lower claim severity than anticipated in the estimates developed as of december  the following tables provide our insurance segments sap loss and lae ratios loss ratios by major line of business for and with the catastrophe cat and non catastrophe non cat impact shown millions statutory loss and lae ratios earned premium cat loss lae non cat loss lae statutory loss lae cat ratio non cat ratio total loss and lae ratio personal insurance segment standard auto nonstandard auto homeowners other personal total personal business insurance segment commercial auto commercial multi peril fire allied lines other product liability workers compensation other commercial total business total sap personal and business

workers compensation  which represents approximately of our business insurance portfolio and less than of our overall insurance segment portfolio  tends to be a more volatile line of business due to its size and risks written 
we do not write mono line workers compensation  but make our product available as part of the business package policy 
the increase in the level of losses as compared to was driven largely by an increase in severity rather than frequency 
we regularly monitor frequency and severity trends  as well as the overall construction of our workers compensation book of business 
in addition  we promote the writing of the low hazard risk types that have developed a consistent pattern of profitability

the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are included as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss and as such are not included in the determination of net income 

table of contents our primary investment objectives are to generate income  preserve capital and maintain adequate liquidity for the payment of claims and expenses 
our current investment strategy does not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have investment policy guidelines with respect to purchasing fixed maturity investments for our insurance subsidiaries which preclude investments in bonds that are rated below investment grade by a recognized rating service 
for the insurance subsidiaries  the maximum investment in any single note or bond is limited to or less of statutory assets  other than obligations of the us government or government agencies  for which there is no limit 
our fixed maturity portfolio is composed of high quality  investment grade issues  comprised almost entirely of debt issues rated aaa or aa 
at december   we had no fixed maturity investments rated below investment grade 
our only investments in asset backed securities were in federal agency pools fannie mae and freddie mac and government guaranteed pools ginnie mae 
our internally managed equity portfolio invests in us large cap  dividend paying companies across many different industries selected based upon their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
this diversification across companies and industries reduces volatility in the value of the large cap equity portfolio 
in addition  our investment policy guidelines limit the purchase of a specific stock to no more than of the market value of the stock at the time of purchase  and no single equity holding should exceed of the total equity portfolio 
during the fourth quarter  we began to diversify our equity portfolio and utilize outside money managers to invest in us small cap equities and international funds 
these managers are permitted to manage the portfolios according to their own respective portfolio objectives 
in selecting our outside money managers we confirm that their portfolio objectives  including risk tolerance  are acceptable to us  however  there may be slight differences in their objectives with respect to dividend payments and other constraints that we apply to our large cap equity holdings 
by further diversifying our portfolio into small cap equities and international funds  we hope to achieve a greater total return with reduced volatility 
in august  we completed a portfolio diversification study with the objective to reduce the volatility of the returns and improve our overall after tax return while continuing to maintain a high quality portfolio 
based on this study  the committee defined below approved the following target asset allocation cash and cash equivalents core fixed maturities treasury inflation protected securities large cap equities small cap equities international funds total portfolio 
table of contents composition of investment portfolio beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began investing funds as they became available moving toward our targeted asset allocations over the next to months 
the following table provides a breakdown of our investments relative to our targeted allocated percentages provided above at december  we measure our investment portfolio allocation with fixed maturities at amortized cost and equities and international funds at fair value

at december   our equity portfolio consisted of approximately different large cap stocks and small cap stocks 
the largest single position was of the equity portfolio based on fair value and the top ten positions were equal to approximately of the equity portfolio 
our equity portfolio consists primarily of large cap value oriented stocks  with a small allocation to small cap equities 
therefore  when large cap stocks and or value oriented stocks perform well our equity 
table of contents portfolio typically performs well compared to benchmarks 
conversely  when growth stocks outperform value and or small to mid cap stocks outperform large cap stocks  our equity portfolio does not perform as well compared to benchmarks

this reallocation effort would result in lower pre tax investment yields but higher after tax investment income than if we had continued under the then current allocation percentages 
in november  the committee approved a million repositioning of the then current taxable and tax exempt holdings to reach our targeted percentage at a quicker pace than if we just used new monies 
based on this action  the sale of approximately million of taxable securities was completed by december  reinvestment into tax exempt securities of the proceeds from these actions was completed during the first quarter during the committee s march meeting  the allocation status was reviewed and the committee approved an additional million repositioning of the then current taxable and tax exempt holdings 
based on this action  the sale of approximately million of taxable securities was completed by march  reinvestment into tax exempt securities of the proceeds from these actions was completed during the second quarter 
after completion of the targeted rebalancing  we assessed the securities held and confirmed our intent to hold the remaining securities until either recovery of fair value or maturity 

table of contents investment operations revenue net investment income for was million compared to million in in our average invested assets increased due to our insurance segments favorable underwriting cash flows 
however  our pre tax return on investments declined slightly as provided in the table below due largely to rebalancing our fixed maturity portfolio as described above toward tax exempt bonds  which have a lower yield on a pre tax basis 
after tax  our net investment income for was million effective tax rate compared to million effective tax rate for millions year ended december gross investment income fixed maturities equity securities other total gross investment income less investment expenses net investment income average invested assets at cost annualized investment yield annualized investment yield  after tax realized gains and losses on investments for the years ended december  and  respectively are summarized as follows millions realized gains losses proceeds received on sale realized gains losses proceeds received on sale realized gains fixed maturities equity securities total realized gains realized losses fixed maturities equity securities total realized losses net realized gains on investments most of the realized gains in were derived from the equity segment of the portfolio 
equity sales were executed for various reasons  including the achievement of our price target and raising funds within two of our insurance subsidiaries to fund cash dividends to state auto financial 
see other capital transactions section below 
the realized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio were achieved by selling shorter term tax exempt securities and subsequently reinvesting those funds into longer term tax exempt securities as well as selling taxable securities to reinvest the proceeds into the tax exempt securities as described above 
for the year ended december   realized losses of million on the fixed maturities related primarily to selling taxable securities to support our shift into tax exempt securities 
realized losses of million on equity securities related primarily to the sale of equity positions where changes in government policy or business conditions  in our opinion  greatly diminished future business prospects 

table of contents we regularly monitor our investment portfolio for declines in value that are otti  an assessment which requires significant management judgment 
among the factors considered by management are the nature of the investment  severity and length of decline in fair value  events impacting the issuer  overall market conditions  and our intent and ability to hold securities until recovery 
when a security in our investment portfolio has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is otti  we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not otti  are included in other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   we recognized million otti compared to million for the same period 
during  we recognized no otti on our fixed maturity portfolio  however  we recognized million in realized losses related to otti within our equity portfolio 
of the million in realized losses  million related to two equity positions within the consumer cyclical sector impacted by the downturn in the housing industry 
the remaining million in realized losses was limited to our externally managed us small cap portfolio for which we were unable to make the assertion regarding our intent to hold particular securities that were currently valued below cost until recovery in the near term 
the otti recognized in were limited to these securities  based on specific facts and judgments related to these particular issuers 
the write downs related primarily to our investment in certain subordinate income notes and principal protected units representing purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
we reduced the estimate of future cash flows we expected to receive from these securities in light of actual default rates of the underlying collateral securities exceeding the assumed defaults 
gross unrealized investment gains and losses a review of our investment portfolio at december  determined there were no individual investments with an unrealized loss that had a fair value significantly below cost continually for more than one year 
there were also no individual material securities with an unrealized holding loss at december  the following table provides detailed information on our available for sale investment portfolio for our gross unrealized gains and losses at december  millions  except number of positions investment category cost or amortized cost gross unrealized holding gains number of gain positions gross unrealized holding losses number of loss positions fair value fixed maturities us treasury securities states and political subdivisions corporate securities mortgage backed securities of us gov

table of contents other income statement items interest expense on our debt was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate is largely affected by the amount of underwriting profit or loss and net realized investment gains or losses that are taxed at approximately relative to the amount of net investment income at its effective tax rate 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate was compared to for the same period 
as previously discussed  the effective tax rate on net investment income declined to for versus for liquidity and capital resources general liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our short and long term needs 
our primary sources of cash are premiums  investment income  investment sales and the maturity of fixed income security investments 
the significant outflows of cash are payments of claims  commissions  premium taxes  operating expenses  income taxes  dividends  interest and principal payments on debt and investment purchases 
the cash outflows can vary due to uncertainties regarding settlement of large losses or catastrophe events 
as a result  we continually monitor our investment and reinsurance programs to ensure they are appropriately structured to enable the insurance subsidiaries to meet anticipated short and long term cash requirements without the need to sell investments to meet fluctuations in claim payments 
we maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid investments to ensure the immediate availability of funds to pay claims and expenses 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents  and  million and  million  respectively  of total available for sale investments at fair value 
included in our fixed maturities available for sale at fair value are million and million of securities on deposit with insurance regulators as required by law at december  and  respectively 
in addition  substantially all of our fixed maturity and equity securities are traded on public markets 
for a further discussion regarding investments see investments operations segment included in this item our insurance subsidiaries must have adequate liquidity to ensure that their cash obligations are met 
however  because the stfc pooled companies participate in the pooling arrangement  they do not have the daily liquidity concerns normally associated with an insurance company 
this is because under the terms of the pooling arrangement  state auto mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the insurance business produced by the pool participants and then settles the intercompany balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies within days following each quarter end 
when settling the intercompany balances  state auto mutual provides the pool participants with full credit for the premiums written and net losses paid during the quarter and retains all receivable amounts from insureds and agents and reinsurance recoverable on paid losses from unaffiliated reinsurers 
any receivable amounts that are ultimately deemed to be uncollectible are charged off by state auto mutual and allocated to the pool member on the basis of pool participation 
as a result  we have an off balance sheet credit risk related to the balances due to state auto mutual from insureds  agents and reinsurers  which are offset by the unearned premium from the respective policies 
while the total amount due to state auto mutual from policyholders and agents is significant  the individual amounts due are relatively small at the policyholder and agency level 
based on historical data  this credit risk exposure is not considered to be material to our financial position  though the impact to income on a quarterly basis may be material 
the state auto group mitigates its exposure to this credit risk through its in house collections unit for both personal and commercial accounts which is supplemented by third party collection service providers 
the amounts deemed uncollectible by state auto mutual and allocated to the stfc pooled companies are included in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

table of contents the state auto group s reliance on ceded reinsurance is not significant in comparison to the state auto group s total statutory surplus or our total financial position 
to minimize the risk of reinsurer default  the state auto group cedes only to third party reinsurers who are rated a or better by am best and also utilizes both domestic and international markets to diversify its credit risk 
we utilize reinsurance to limit our loss exposure and contribute to our liquidity and capital resources 
for a discussion of our reinsurance arrangements  see reinsurance arrangements included in this item net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
significant sources of operating cash flows are derived from underwriting operations and net investment income 
in addition  benefited from the million of cash received by the stfc pooled companies in connection with the pooling change 
there is also a corresponding ongoing impact of adding the new pool business which is reflected in the premiums  losses and expenses excluding the one time pooling change 
in addition  losses were higher in than due to the increased level of catastrophes previously discussed 
the table below is a proforma of the direct method of our operating cash flows 
millions increase decrease one time pooling change excluding pooling change net premium written investment income loss and lae paid expense paid federal income tax other total expense paid includes interest paid during the year of million in and million in the positive net cash provided by operating activities in and was largely due to favorable underwriting and investment income cash flows  offset by increases in cash paid on estimated federal income taxes  interest expense and cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan 
cash from operations in increased million over primarily due to a reduction in claim payments from a lower level of catastrophe losses in compared to offset partially by an increase in taxes paid 
despite the increased level of catastrophe losses in  we managed our cash flows through current operational activity and maturities of investments  without a need to liquidate investments in the uncertain market environment 
see investment operations segment composition of investment portfolio included in this item for further discussion 
however  should our written premium decline or paid losses increase significantly or a combination thereof our cash flows from operations could be impacted requiring us to liquidate investments at a loss 
during  and  as permitted by regulations of the internal revenue service  we made cash contributions of million  million and million  respectively  to our defined benefit pension plan on behalf of our employees 
the actuarially determined contribution to our defined benefit pension plan ranges from the minimum amount we would be required to contribute to the maximum amount that would be tax deductible 
amounts contributed in excess of the minimum are deemed voluntary while amounts in excess of the maximum would be subject to an excise tax and may not be deductible for tax purposes 
amounts paid in each of these three years were within the minimum and maximum funding amounts that would be deductible for tax purposes 
the actuarially determined funding amount to the plan is generally not determined until the second quarter with respect to the contribution year  though we currently expect to make a minimum cash contribution to our defined benefit pension plan of approximately million during for a further discussion regarding our defined benefit pension plan  see employee benefit plans included in this item 
table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decline in versus was principally the result of an increase in the accumulation of cash for future claims settlements and intercompany payments to affiliates and to pay stockholder dividends 
the increase in versus was principally the result of a greater amount of cash and cash equivalents available to invest at the beginning of versus million in compared to million in  an increase in the level of cash provided from operations between the two years 
our financing activities for  and produced net cash outflows of million  million  and million  respectively 
the following contributed to the fluctuations between those years dividends paid to shareholders totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in dividends paid between  and was due to increasing the amount of dividends paid per common share 
dividends paid per common share were in  in and in cash used to repurchase common shares under our stock repurchase program was million and million for and  respectively 
see other capital transactions below 
other capital transactions on august   state auto financial s board of directors authorized the repurchase  from time to time  of up to million of its common shares  or approximately of state auto financial s outstanding shares  over a period extending to and through december  state auto financial will repurchase shares from state auto mutual in amounts that are proportional to the respective current ownership percentages of state auto mutual  which is approximately  and other shareholders 
for the year ended december  a total of  of common shares were purchased under this program at an average repurchase price of per share for a total of million 
since inception through december   a total of  common shares have been purchased under this program at an average purchase price of per share for a total of million 
on november   the board of directors of state auto financial declared a cash dividend of per share 
the dividend was payable on december   to shareholders of record on december  on march   the board of directors of state auto financial declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share 
the dividend is payable on march   to shareholders of record on march  this is the st consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by state auto financial s board since we had our initial public offering of common stock on june  to fund capital transactions and provide additional working capital to state auto financial  in state auto p c  milbank  farmers  and state auto national insurance company sa national declared cash dividends of million  million  million and million  respectively 
the cash transfer of dividends was completed in the dividends from state auto p c  milbank  farmers and sa national were paid from unassigned statutory surplus and were not considered to be extraordinary for regulatory purposes 
other events on march   we issued a press release announcing preliminary estimates of the catastrophe storm activity that hit our midwest operating states 
this press release disclosed our expectation that first quarter earnings will include between and million in pre tax catastrophe losses related to late january and early february storm activity 
over the past five years  we have experienced an average of million in catastrophe losses during the first quarter 
while the january and february catastrophe storm losses will be significant to our first quarter results  we do not expect these losses to have a significant impact on our overall financial position 

table of contents borrowing arrangements the following provides an overview of our borrowing arrangements during and outstanding at december  credit agreement state auto financial has a credit agreement credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders which provides for a million five year unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility 
the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes 
the credit facility provides for interest only payments during its term  with principal due in full at maturity 
interest is based on a london interbank market rate or a base rate plus a calculated margin amount 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants  including financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum net worth and not exceed a certain debt to capitalization ratio 
as of december   state auto financial had not made any borrowings and was in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit agreement 
we are currently evaluating whether we should amend or terminate this agreement based on our needs and other options available for contingency funding 
we believe our other sources of cash are sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we currently do not intend to drawdown any funds under the credit facility

reinsurance arrangements members of the state auto group follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of their exposures and paying to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received 
insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge the individual members of the state auto group from primary liability for the full amount of limits applicable under their policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
during  the beacon insurance group was added to the state auto group s reinsurance programs described below and as of january   the patrons group was added to these programs 
each member of the state auto group is party to working reinsurance treaties for casualty  workers compensation and property lines with several reinsurers arranged through a reinsurance intermediary 
these agreements are described in more detail below 
we have also secured other reinsurance to limit the net cost of large loss events for certain types of coverage written in certain companies  including reinsurance covering umbrella liability losses up to a limit of million with a maximum of million retention 
the state auto group also makes use of facultative reinsurance for unique risk situations 
facultative reinsurance provides for a separate reinsurance agreement covering a particular risk or insurance policy 
the state auto group also participates in state insurance pools and associations 
in general  these pools and associations are state sponsored and or operated  impose mandatory participation by insurers doing business in that state  and offer coverage for hard to place risks at premium rates established by the state sponsor or operator  thereby transferring risk of loss to the participating insurers in exchange for premiums which may not be commensurate with the risk assumed 
the casualty excess of loss reinsurance agreement provides that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of a covered loss 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
also  certain unusual claim situations involving bodily injury liability  property damage  uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are covered by an arrangement that provides for million of coverage in excess of million retention for each loss occurrence 
this layer of reinsurance sits above the million excess of million arrangement 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the workers compensation excess of loss reinsurance agreement provides that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of covered loss 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
net retentions under this agreement may be submitted to the casualty excess of loss agreement  subject to a limit of million per loss occurrence 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
in addition to the workers compensation reinsurance described above  each company in the state auto group is party to an agreement which provides an additional layer of reinsurance for workers compensation losses involving multiple workers 
subject to million of retention  reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
this coverage is subject to a maximum any 
table of contents one life limitation of million 
this limitation means that losses associated with each worker may contribute no more than million to covered loss under this agreement 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the property per risk excess of loss reinsurance agreement provides that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of each covered loss 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
members of the state auto group maintain a property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement covering catastrophe related events affecting at least two risks 
on july   concurrent with the renewal of the agreement  we increased the limit of coverage by million from million to million 
the limit of million is structured in two layers 
the first is million excess of our retention  and the second is million excess of the first layer 
on a combined basis  the members of the state auto group retain the first million of catastrophe loss  each occurrence  with a co participation on the next million of covered loss  each occurrence 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered losses  each occurrence 
our companies are responsible for losses above million 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the terms of the property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement described above provide that if coverage is exhausted  coverage may be reinstated upon payment of an additional premium 
by this reinstatement provision  the property catastrophe reinsurance agreement effectively provides two sets of limits that may be used to cover multiple events 
in september  hurricane ike produced losses to the members of the state auto group that exceeded the million retention layer  and were expected to exhaust the first million layer of reinsurance coverage 
on october   members of the state auto group entered into a separate property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement the third event agreement which provided an additional million of coverage in excess of our million retention layer 
under the third event agreement  the members of the state auto group  on a combined basis  retain the first million of catastrophe loss  each occurrence  with a co participation on the next million of covered loss  each occurrence 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered losses  each occurrence 
the third event agreement does not include a provision to reinstate coverage if exhausted 
prior to july   members of the state auto group participated in an intercompany catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement the catastrophe assumption agreement under which state auto p c acted as the catastrophe reinsurer for the state auto group 
under the catastrophe assumption agreement state auto p c was responsible for up to million of covered losses in excess of the million of covered losses under the catastrophe reinsurance arrangement described above 
the catastrophe assumption agreement was not renewed and expired on july  there had been no losses assumed under the catastrophe assumption agreement during  and as of january   members of the state auto group entered into a property catastrophe net aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement the catastrophe aggregate agreement 
this is a new agreement which provides reinsurance coverage for certain catastrophic events  including certain events falling below the million retention under the property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement previously described 
events covered by the catastrophe aggregate agreement must be pcs numbered catastrophes  excluding earthquakes and named storms such as hurricanes and tropical storms 
individual occurrences are capped at million and are subject to a million franchise deductible  meaning occurrences producing losses totaling less than million are excluded 
subject to these limitations  qualifying losses from individual occurrences are then aggregated over the course of the reinsurance term  january  through december  on an aggregate basis  the members of the state auto group combined retain the first million of covered loss  with a co participation on the next million of covered loss 
the reinsurer is responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss on an aggregate basis

regulatory considerations at december   and  each of our insurance subsidiaries was in compliance with statutory requirements relating to capital adequacy 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic utilizes a collection of analytical tools designed to assist state insurance departments with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the 
table of contents financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
one such set of analytical tools is key financial ratios that are known in the insurance industry as the iris ratios 
iris ratios are derived from financial statements prepared on a statutory accounting basis  which are accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department with regulatory authority over our insurance subsidiaries 
a defined range of results for each ratio has been established by the naic for solvency monitoring 
while management utilizes each of these iris ratios in monitoring our insurance companies operating performance on a statutory accounting basis each of our insurance subsidiaries operates within the defined range for the other measures  the net written premium to statutory surplus ratio the leverage ratio is monitored to ensure that each of our insurance subsidiaries continue to operate within the defined range of to the higher the leverage ratio  the more risk a company bears in relation to statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
in considering this range  management also considers the distribution of net premiums between property and liability lines of business 
a company with a larger portion of net premiums from liability lines should generally maintain a lower leverage ratio 
as shown below the leverage ratios increased from to net written premiums increased primarily due to a combination of increased organic growth and the impact of the pooling change along with our insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus decreasing mostly due to underwriting losses coupled with realized and unrealized losses on investments 
the statutory leverage ratios for our insurance subsidiaries at december   and were as follows statutory leverage ratios state auto p c milbank farmers sa ohio sa national weighted average we use the statutory leverage ratio as there is no comparable gaap measure 
table excludes the one time impact on net written premiums of million that occurred in conjunction with the pooling change 
our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to state auto financial which in turn may be used by state auto financial to pay dividends to stockholders or to make principal and interest payments on debt 
individual states limit the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in those states can pay without prior approval 
under current law  at december  million is available in for payment as a dividend from our insurance subsidiaries to state auto financial  without prior approval from our respective domiciliary state insurance departments 
in and  state auto financial received million and million  respectively in dividends from its insurance subsidiaries and none in we are required to notify the insurance subsidiaries applicable state insurance commissioner within five business days after declaration of all such dividends and at least ten days prior to payment 
additionally  the domiciliary state commissioner of each insurance subsidiary has the authority to limit a dividend when the commissioner determines  based on factors set forth in the law  that an insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs 
such restrictions are not expected to limit the capacity of state auto financial to meet its cash obligations 
state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states in which they do business 
the naic has developed risk based capital rbc requirements 
rbc attempts to relate an individual insurance company s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations 
rbc requires the 
table of contents calculation of a ratio of total adjusted statutory capital to authorized control level 
insurers with a ratio below are subject to different levels of regulatory intervention and action 
at december   the ratio of total adjusted statutory capital to authorized control level of state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries ranged from to 
credit and financial strength ratings the following table summarizes our credit and insurance company financial strength ratings as of march  am best moody s standard poor s stfc credit rating a baa bbb stfc pooled companies financial strength a a a sa national financial strength a n a a we are reviewed regularly by the independent rating agencies listed in the table above 
ratings provide a meaningful way for policyholders  agents  creditors and stockholders to compare us to our competitors 
the published credit ratings on state auto financial senior notes discussed above are opinions as to the ability of state auto financial to meet its ongoing obligations under the terms of the senior notes 
generally  credit ratings affect the cost  type and availability of debt financing 
higher rated securities receive more favorable pricing and terms relative to lower rated securities at the time of issue 
state auto financial s senior notes have been rated investment grade by each agency 
in february moody s lowered our credit rating from baa to baa due to moody s belief that the debt incurred by state auto mutual in connection with its acquisition of rockhill holding company will reduce the ability of state auto mutual to offer contingent support to us 
contingent support had been the rationale for narrower notching between our credit rating and insurance financial strength rating two notches instead of the customary three for us insurance holding companies 
the published financial strength ratings on the insurance company subsidiaries of state auto financial are opinions as to the ability of those companies to meet their ongoing obligations to their policyholders 
the am best financial strength ratings influence our ability to write insurance business as agents and policyholders generally prefer higher rated companies 
lower rated companies may be required to compete for agents and policyholders by offering higher commissions or lower premiums and expanded coverage  or a combination thereof 
state auto mutual has received am best s a or higher rating every year since the stfc pooled companies and the mutual pooled companies are collectively assigned a pool rating by am best while sa national is rated by a 
m 
best as a part of the total group 
our ratings are influenced by many factors including operating and financial performance  asset quality  liquidity  financial leverage  exposure to catastrophe risks and operating leverage 
presently  our am best  moody s and standard poor s ratings are assigned stable outlooks 
other employee benefit plans the state auto group has a defined benefit pension plan and a postretirement health care plan covering substantially all employees collectively the benefit plans 
several factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the benefit plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these 
table of contents assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us in determining benefit obligations may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas which requires employers with defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans  such as health care  to recognize the funded status of its benefit plans on its balance sheet and measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end balance sheet date thereby eliminating the use of an earlier measurement date and to provide additional disclosures 
adopting sfas required us to recognize the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations on our balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the adoption of sfas at december  had the impact of decreasing accumulated comprehensive income by million  net of tax 
effective january   we adopted the measurement date requirement under transition alternative method one  as defined in sfas this transition method resulted in a one time adjustment that decreased beginning retained earnings by million  net of tax 
the combined impact of the measurement date transition and re measurement of plan assets and obligations on january   increased beginning accumulated comprehensive income by million  net of tax 
the discount rate used to re measure our benefit plan obligations at january  was an increase of points from the earlier measurement date of september   which was used to report our benefit obligations on december  to calculate the state auto group s december  pension projected benefit obligation pbo  we used a discount rate of based on an evaluation of the expected future benefit cash flows of our defined benefit pension plan used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve at the measurement date 
a lower discount rate results in  all else equal  a higher present value of the benefit obligation 
we selected an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of by considering the mix of investments and stability of investment portfolio along with actual investment experience during the lifetime of the plan 
to calculate the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december   a discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of were used 
our funding status on our pension plan went from a million asset at january   to a million liability at december  the decline in interest rates over the course of the year and the difference between expected and actual return on assets held by our pension plan had the effect of increasing our liability and cumulative unrecognized actuarial loss  a component of accumulated comprehensive loss in our equity 
the factors influencing these increases are as follows the selected discount rate of decreased points from the rate used at january   which had the effect of increasing the pbo and related unrecognized actuarial loss approximately million  and the actual return on our plan assets was a loss of million compared to an expected return of million for a net increase to our liability and unrecognized actuarial loss of approximately million 
in addition to the discount rate and expected to actual return on plan assets  unrecognized gains and losses arise from several factors including expected to actual demographic changes  such as retirement age  mortality  turnover  and rate of compensation increases 
the cumulative unrecognized actuarial loss is systematically recognized as an increase in net periodic cost over the average future service period of active participants 
the accumulated benefit obligation abo of a defined benefit plan represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to the measurement date and based on current and past compensation levels  while the pbo is the abo plus a factor for future compensation levels 
the abo  which considers current compensations level only  provides information about 
table of contents the obligation an employer would have if the plan were discontinued at the date of measurement date 
at december   the abo and pbo were million and million  respectively 
at december  the fair value of the assets of our defined benefit pension plan was million  which resulted in an underfunding status within our balance sheet of million 
the state auto group has consistently targeted contributions to our defined benefit pension plan with the objective of maintaining a fully funded status on an abo basis 
historically our plan assets have exceeded our abo 
given the recent significant decline in the pension plan s asset we are reviewing the options available to us from a funding perspective 
currently we are anticipating a minimum cash contribution in of million 
our unfunded status on our postretirement medical plan retiree med plan decreased from million at january  to million at december  the factors influencing this decrease are as follows in october  we announced a substantive change to increase retiree cost sharing in the retiree med plan  effective january  this change will allow us to decrease our overall company costs and continue to provide a competitive retiree med plan for all associates and current retirees 
the increase in the cost sharing will be phased in over five years for current retirees and those associates who announced their retirement before december  and retire in the first half of on october   this change reduced our pbo and unrecognized prior service balance  a component of accumulated comprehensive loss in our equity  by million 
offsetting the cost share plan change is a combination of the following factors a key assumptions used in determining the amount of the benefit obligation and related periodic cost are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate 
we decreased our selected discount rate by points to from the rate used at january  we assume that the relative increase in health care costs will continue to rise over the next several years 
for the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was for  trending down per year to thereafter 
changes to these two key assumptions  had the effect of increasing our obligation and unrecognized actuarial loss at december  b additional unrecognized net actuarial gains or losses adjustments arising from demographic changes and expected to actual claims experience  which at december  had the effect of increasing our obligation and unrecognized actuarial loss 
in october  we offered an early retirement incentive option to retirement eligible associates 
this early retirement option is deemed a special termination benefit under sfas no employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of define benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
an employer offering special termination benefits to employees must recognize a liability and an expense when the following conditions are met the employees accept the offer  and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we recognized an expense of million for the acceleration of certain plan benefits for those retirement eligible associates who elected early retirement 
loss and loss expense reserves our loss and loss expense reserves reflect all unpaid amounts for claims that have been reported as well as for claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr 
our loss and loss expense reserves are not discounted to present value 
losses and allocated loss expense reserves loss and alae reserve are management s best estimates mbe at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to settle all claims incurred as of that date based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined by claims adjusters based on our reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and applicable policy provisions 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months are case reserved at that time 
the process for calculating the ibnr component of the loss and alae reserve is to develop an estimate of the ultimate losses and allocated loss expenses incurred  and subtract all amounts already paid or held as case or formula reserves 

table of contents the ultimate determination of mbe integrates information and analysis provided by several disciplines within our company  including claims  actuarial and accounting 
this assessment requires considerable judgment in understanding how claims mature  which lines of business are the most volatile  and how trends change over time 
loss and alae reserves represent an estimate at a given point in time based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
although we consider many different sources of information  as well as a number of actuarial methodologies to estimate our loss and alae reserve  there is no single method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
our internal actuarial staff conducts quarterly reviews of projected loss development information to assist management in making estimates of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
several factors are considered in estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure growth  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  and late reported claims 
in addition  reasonableness tests are performed on many of the assumptions underlying each reserving methodology  such as claim frequency  claim severity and loss ratios 
nonetheless  changes which are not contemplated do occur over time  and those changes are incorporated in subsequent valuations of the loss reserves 
we use a number of different methodologies to estimate the ibnr component of the loss and alae reserves 
our reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail lines of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
in general  the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
the reserving methods and strengths and weaknesses of each are described below 
short tail business for short tail business  claims are typically settled within five years  and the most common actuarial estimates are based on techniques using link ratio projections of incurred losses  paid losses  claim counts and claim severities 
each of these methods is described below in detail 
separate projections are made for catastrophes that are in the very early stages of development based on specific information known through the reporting date 
incurred loss development method the incurred loss development method is probably the most common actuarial method used in projecting indicated ibnr reserves 
this method uses paid loss experience as well as the outstanding estimates formula and case reserves for claims that have been reported and are still open 
the underlying assumption of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy remains consistent over time 
this method s advantage is its responsiveness to changes in reported losses  which is particularly valuable in the less mature accident years 
the disadvantage of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy changes will distort the ibnr projections 
paid loss development method the paid loss development method uses calculations that are very similar to the incurred loss development method 
the key difference is that the data used in the paid method exclude case reserve estimates  so only paid losses are utilized 
with this method  a payment pattern is estimated to project ultimate settlement values for each accident year  with the underlying assumption that claims are settled at a consistent rate over time 
neither case reserves nor the rate at which claims are reported except to the extent that the reporting pattern influences the payment pattern is relevant to the results of this method 
this method s advantage is the estimates of ultimate loss are independent of case reserve adequacy and are unaffected by company changes in case reserving philosophy 
the disadvantages are that the paid method does not use all of the available information  and in some cases the liability payment patterns require the application of very large development factors to relatively small payments in less mature accident years 
claim counts and severities method the counts and severities method calculations are very similar to the other methods 
the incurred claim counts reported to date are projected to an ultimate number 
similarly  the incurred loss severities are projected to an ultimate value 
the ultimate incurred count is multiplied by the 
table of contents ultimate incurred severity  for each accident year  to arrive at the ultimate incurred loss 
finally  as with the other loss development methods  an estimate of the ibnr reserve is calculated by subtracting the reported losses from the estimated ultimate losses 
long tail business reserve estimates for long tail business use the same methods listed above along with several other methods as determined by the actuary 
for example  premium based methods may be used in developing ultimate loss estimates  including the expected loss ratio  bornhuetter ferguson  and least squares techniques as described below 
we also use statistical models when the historical patterns can be reasonably approximated 
expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method generates indicated ibnr by multiplying an expected loss ratio by earned premium  then subtracting incurred to date losses 
for slower reporting lines of business  new products  or data that is very immature  the actual claim data is often too limited or too volatile for other projection methods 
with this method the premiums are used as a measure of loss exposure  and the loss ratios can be derived from pricing expectations 
bornhuetter ferguson method the bornhuetter ferguson method is a weighted average of the expected loss ratio method and the incurred loss development method  using the percentage of losses reported as the weight 
this method is particularly useful where there is a low volume of data in the current accident period  or where the experience is volatile 
in general  this method produces estimates that are very similar to the incurred loss development method 
least square loss development method in the least squares loss development method the statistical technique of least squares regression is applied to a triangle of reported loss ratios to project the ultimate loss ratio in each accident year 
using historical loss ratios puts the data for each time period on a more consistent exposure basis  because premium levels are generally correlated with insured exposures 
a by product of the regression function is an estimate of credibility for each stage of development 
in cases where the regression parameters fall outside of a reasonable range  the projection defaults to the incurred loss method 
selection process in determining which reserving method to use for a particular line of business or accident year  diagnostic tests of loss ratios and severity trends are considered  as well as the historic case reserve adequacy and claim settlement rate 
in general  the incurred loss development method is used if the projections are stable  the data is credible  historic case reserve adequacy is consistent  and the loss ratios and loss severities are reasonable 
other reserving methods are considered as well for particular lines of business or accident years  along with supplemental information such as open claim counts and prior period development 
for example  if more than one method provides a reasonable projection  the actuary may select an average of those methods 
there is considerable judgment applied in the analysis of the historical patterns and in applying business knowledge of our underwriting and claims functions 
reserve ranges provide a quantification of the variability in the reserve projections 
the primary determinant in estimating the reserve range boundaries are the variances measured within the historical reserving data for the various lines of business 
property lines typically have smaller variances  while liability lines can experience significant variability 
mbe of loss reserves considers the expected variation to establish an appropriate position within a range 
mbe loss and alae reserves for sa national and the stfc pooled companies share of the pooled companies reserves at december  was million  within a projected range of million to million 
these values presented are on a direct basis  gross of salvage and subrogation recoverable  and before reinsurance  except for the stfc pooled companies participation in the inter company pooling arrangement 
therefore  these values cannot be compared to many of the other loss and loss expenses payable tables included elsewhere within this form k 
the potential impact of the reserve variability on net income can be illustrated using the range end points and carried reserve amounts listed above 
for example  if ultimate losses reach a level corresponding to the high 
table of contents point of the range  million  the reserve increase of million corresponds to an after tax decrease of million in net income 
likewise  should ultimate losses decline to a level corresponding to the low point of the range  million  the million reserve decrease would add million of after tax net income 
the reserve range noted above represents a range of reasonably likely reserves  not a range of all possible reserves 
therefore  the ultimate losses could reach levels corresponding to reserve amounts outside the range provided 
an important assumption underlying the reserve estimation methods for the major casualty lines is that the loss cost trends implicitly built into the loss and alae patterns will continue into the future 
to estimate the sensitivity of reserves to an unexpected change in inflation  projected calendar year payment patterns were applied to the december   other product liability loss and alae reserve to generate estimated annual incremental loss and alae payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for purposes of sensitivity testing  an additional annual loss cost trend of was added to the trend implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and alae payments were calculated 
this type of inflationary increase could arise from a variety of sources including tort law changes  development of new medical procedures  social inflation  and other inflationary changes in costs beyond assumed levels 
the estimated cumulative impact that this additional  unexpected increase in the loss cost trend would have on our results of operations over the lifetime of the underlying claims in other product liability is an increase of million on reserves  or a million reduction to net income  assuming a tax rate of 
inflation changes have much more impact on the longer tail commercial lines like other product liability and workers compensation  and much less impact on the shorter tail personal lines reserves 
in addition to establishing loss and alae reserves  as described above  we establish reserves for loss adjustment expenses related to functions and costs that are not attributable to a specific claim  which is called unallocated loss adjustment expense ulae 
historical patterns of paid ulae relative to paid loss are analyzed along with historical claim counts including claims opened  claims closed  and claims remaining open 
the product of this analysis is an estimate of the relationship  or ratio  between ulae and loss underlying the current loss reserves 
this ratio is applied to the current outstanding loss reserves to estimate the required ulae reserve 
consequently  this component of the loss expense reserve has a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held loss reserves by accident year 
the method assumes that the underlying claims process and mix of business do not change materially over time

asbestos reserves are million  and environmental reserves are million  for a total of million  or of net losses and loss expenses payable 
asbestos reserves increased million and environmental reserves decreased million from because we have insured primarily product retailers and distributors  we do not expect to incur the same level of liability  particularly related to asbestos  as companies that have insured manufacturing risks 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in the loss and loss expense reserve estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience being different from historical data and trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 
impact of inflation inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss expenses are known 
when establishing rates  we attempt to anticipate increases from inflation subject to the limitations of modeling economic variables 
even when general inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  is relatively modest  as has been the case over the last several years  price inflation on the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling claims can steadily increase 
for example  medical care costs have risen at a higher rate than general inflation over the last few years 
costs for building materials typically rise dramatically following substantial  widespread natural 
table of contents catastrophes  such as the industry experienced in florida and adjacent states in in mississippi and alabama in  and more recently with hurricane katrina in we continue to adjust our pricing projections to reflect current and anticipated changes in costs in all lines of business 
we consider inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and final settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s best estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses
