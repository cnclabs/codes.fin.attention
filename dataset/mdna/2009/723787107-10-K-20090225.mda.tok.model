item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial and operating performance pioneer s financial and operating performance for included the following highlights net income decreased percent to million per diluted share in from million per diluted share in  primarily due to uinta piceance and mississippi asset impairment charges recorded during  an increase in effective income tax rates during and net income in including a million gain on the sale of canada and income from discontinued operations in canada 
income from continuing operations decreased to million per diluted share for  as compared to million per diluted share for  primarily due to the aforementioned impairment charges and a higher effective income tax rate average daily sales volumes  on a boe basis  increased percent in as compared to  primarily due to successful drilling programs  core area acquisitions and a percent decrease in the delivery of vpp volumes 
oil and gas revenues increased million  or percent in  as compared to  due to a combination of increased production and increases in commodity prices 
the benefit of this increase was partially offset by a million increase in production costs compared to  principally as a result of higher energy related costs and service cost inflation 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  or percent as compared to  primarily due to increased sales volumes and increased commodity prices 
the company s alaskan oooguruk project began first production and sales during the company received approval for optional acre downspacing fieldwide in the spraberry field  significantly increasing development opportunities in the field 
pioneer southwest completed its initial public offering of  common units representing limited partner interests  with the company realizing total net proceeds of million 
the company purchased million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million under the company s share repurchase program 
the company initiated cost reduction initiatives in response to significant commodity price declines experienced during the third and fourth quarters of significant events financial markets 
during the second half of  worldwide financial markets experienced significant turmoil as concerns regarding a worldwide economic slowdown increased and the availability of liquidity provided by the financial markets declined 
these concerns have continued into the first quarter of in response to these circumstances  governments worldwide have taken steps to enhance confidence in and support for the financial markets and have announced economic stimulus programs 
the success of these actions and the duration of the uncertainty in financial markets cannot be predicted 
the company is closely monitoring the economic environment  including whether and to what extent sustained lower commodity prices could impact its short term liquidity 
longer term  depending on the severity and duration of the worldwide economic decline  these market conditions could negatively impact the company s liquidity  financial position and future results of operations 
as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents and billion in outstanding long term debt  with million of liquidity under its senior unsecured credit facility that matures in the amount of liquidity under the credit facility is subject to a covenant requiring that the company maintain a specified ratio of the net present value of the company s oil and gas properties to total debt  with the variables on which the calculation of net present value is based including assumed commodity prices and discount rates being subject to adjustment by the lenders 
therefore  the amount that the company may borrow under the credit facility in the future could be reduced as a result of lower oil  ngl or gas prices  among other items 
as of december   the company was also a party to derivative financial instruments  of which million represent net assets 
management is closely monitoring the credit standings of its counterparties  including its banks  derivative counterparties and purchasers of the commodities the company produces and sells 
commodity prices 
the reduced liquidity provided by the worldwide financial markets and other factors have resulted in an economic slowdown in the united states and other industrialized countries which has further resulted in significant reductions in worldwide energy demand 
at the same time  north american gas supply has increased as a result of the rise in domestic unconventional gas production during and prior years 
the combination of lower demand due to the economic slowdown and higher north american gas supply has resulted in significant declines in oil  ngl and gas prices from their highs earlier in these circumstances have led to a dramatic decrease in drilling activity in the industry and has reduced the demand for drilling rigs and vessels  oilfield supplies  drill pipe and utilities  which had reached very high levels in terms of utilization and cost in mid although these costs have begun to decline  their declines significantly lag behind the declines in oil  ngl and gas prices 
as a result of these circumstances  the company experienced significant operating margin deterioration during the second half of and recognized negative price revisions to proved reserves at the end of due to lower commodity prices and still relatively high capital and operating costs 
the duration and magnitude of the commodity price declines cannot be predicted 
low price environment initiatives 
as a result of the significant drop in commodity prices  the company has implemented initiatives to reduce capital spending  operating costs and general and administrative expenses to support its goal of delivering free cash flow in and to enhance financial flexibility 
this plan includes minimizing drilling activities until margins improve as a result of i increased commodity prices  ii reduced gas price differentials relative to nymex quoted prices in the areas where the company produces gas and or iii decreased well costs 
during  the company is undertaking further efforts to reduce its capital  production and administrative costs 
pioneer has reduced its operated rig activity from rigs in the third quarter of to two rigs drilling in mid february the company is continuing to work with drilling and service providers to reduce drilling and completion costs 
to date  pioneer has achieved reductions of percent to percent in drilling and completion costs and is targeting an additional percent to percent reduction 
rigs have been terminated or stacked in the spraberry  raton  edwards trend and barnett shale areas 
the company s asset teams are also implementing initiatives to reduce controllable production costs  including costs associated with fuel surcharges  electricity supply  water disposal and compression rental 
in  the company expects capital spending to total million to million excluding acquisitions  effects of asset retirement obligations  capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs 
approximately percent of this amount is for drilling  primarily in alaska and the spraberry field 
the remaining percent will be used for facility expansions and acreage extensions to pioneer s core assets 
hurricanes gustav and ike 
during the first two weeks of september  hurricanes gustav and ike struck the louisiana and texas gulf coasts 
the following areas of texas and louisiana were adversely impacted spraberry 
the company s spraberry facilities in west texas were not directly impacted by either hurricane 
the spraberry field produces oil and associated liquid rich gas 
the gas includes ngls which are separated at various permian basin plants 
these ngls are then transported to a third party facility in mont belvieu  texas for fractionation 
this facility sustained power interruptions and physical damage from hurricane ike  disrupting its ability to receive the company s ngls 
as a result  a portion of the company s spraberry and other permian basin area production was shut in or curtailed from early september to mid november while repairs and maintenance to the facility were being completed 
fort worth barnett shale 
the company s barnett shale facilities were not directly impacted by the recent hurricanes 
however  as in the spraberry field  the company s barnett shale gas includes ngls that are processed at the mont belvieu fractionation facilities 
the company experienced only a temporary shut in of its barnett shale production  and production was fully resumed by the end of september 
south texas edwards trend 
no significant hurricane damage occurred at the company s facilities in the edwards trend area of south texas 
however  power interruptions to third party pipelines that transport gas production from the field resulted in the temporary curtailment of portions of the company s total edwards trend net production 
gulf of mexico shelf 
the company s shallow water offshore platforms did not experience any significant damage as a result of the hurricanes 
however  production of approximately  boepd was shut in from august to mid november due to the significant damage that was incurred by the third party pipeline facilities utilized to transport production to shore 
semgroup receivables 
the company is a creditor in the bankruptcy of semgroup  lp and certain of its subsidiaries collectively  semgroup  which filed petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on july  in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
semgroup purchased condensate from the company and  at the time of the bankruptcy filings  was indebted to the company for million 
the company believes that it is probable that the collection of the pre petition claims will not occur for a protracted period of time and that some of its claims may be uncollectible 
consequently  the company recorded a bad debt expense of million during the second half of  which reduced the carrying value of the claims to million 
semgroup s reorganization effort is still in its early stages and determination of the exact amount of uncollectible claims is not presently determinable 
it is reasonably possible that the company will not collect the claims or that collected amounts will be less than million 
if those circumstances occur  the company would recognize additional bad debt expense to further reduce the carrying value of its claims 
the company believes that any losses relating to its failure to collect its semgroup claims would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity  capital resources or future annual results of operations 
see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements for additional information regarding the company s semgroup bankruptcy claims

results of operations oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas revenues totaled billion  billion and billion during  and  respectively 
the revenue increase during  as compared to  was primarily reflective of increases in united states  south africa and tunisia revenues 
the increase in united states revenues was primarily due to an increase in average daily sales volumes resulting from successful drilling programs  core area acquisitions and reductions in scheduled vpp deliveries  combined with a percent increase in reported ngl prices and six percent increases in both reported oil and gas prices 
the increase in tunisian revenues resulted from an increase in average daily sales volumes from successful drilling efforts  a percent increase in reported gas prices and a percent increase in reported oil prices 
south african revenues increased due to an increase in average daily sales volumes realized from a full year of sales from the portion of the wells in the south coast gas project that commenced gas production during the fourth quarter of  and a percent increase in reported oil prices  partially offset by a percent decrease in reported gas prices 
the revenue increase during  as compared to  was primarily reflective of increases in united states and tunisian revenues  partially offset by decreases in south african revenues
