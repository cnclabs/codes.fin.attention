to meet the current and future technical needs in our target markets  we have also established strategic relationships with multiservice operators that provide wired and wireless communications services to consumers and businesses 
a small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenue 
sales to our five largest customers represented  and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and in the foreseeable future 
these customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have 
table of contents varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel  change or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
core technologies using proprietary technologies and advanced design methodologies  we design  develop and supply complete soc solutions and system level software  together with related hardware and software applications for our target markets 
our proven soc design methodology has enabled us to be first to market with advanced chips that are highly integrated and cost effective  and that facilitate the easy integration of our customers intellectual property 
our design methodology leverages industry standard  state of the art electronic design automation tools  and generally migrates easily to new silicon processes and technology platforms 
it also allows for the easy integration of acquired or licensed technology  providing customers with a broad range of silicon options with differentiated networking and performance features 
we believe our key competitive advantages include superior engineering execution and our broad base of core technologies encompassing the complete design space from systems to silicon 
we have developed and continue to build on the following technology foundations proprietary communications systems algorithms and protocols  advanced dsp hardware architectures  soc design methodologies and advanced library development for both standard cell and full custom integrated circuit design  high performance radio frequency  analog and mixed signal circuit design using industry standard cmos processes  high performance custom microprocessor architectures and circuit designs  and extensive software reference platforms and board level hardware reference platforms to enable complete system level solutions 
research and development we have assembled a large team of experienced engineers and technologists  many of whom are leaders in their particular field or discipline 
as of december  we had  research and development employees  the majority of whom hold advanced degrees  including employees with ph 
ds 
these key employees are involved in advancing our core technologies  as well as applying them to our product development activities 
because the soc solutions for many of our target markets benefit from the same underlying core technologies  we are able to address a wide range of wired and wireless communications markets with a relatively focused investment in research and development 
we believe that the achievement of higher levels of integration and the timely introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth 
while we intend to manage our costs and expenses in the short term through a recently announced restructuring plan and other cost saving measures to attain our long term business objectives  we will need to maintain significant research and development staffing levels in and for the foreseeable future 
in addition to our principal design facilities in irvine  california and santa clara county  california  we have design centers throughout the united states 
internationally  we have design facilities in asia  europe and north america 
we anticipate establishing additional design centers in the united states and in other countries 
our research and development expense was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
these amounts included stock based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development of million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents manufacturing wafer fabrication most of our products are manufactured using standard cmos process techniques 
the standard nature of these processes permits us to engage independent silicon foundries to fabricate our integrated circuits 
by subcontracting our manufacturing requirements  we can focus our resources on design and test applications where we believe we have greater competitive advantages 
this strategy also eliminates the high cost of owning and operating semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities 
our operations and quality engineering teams closely manage the interface between manufacturing and design engineering 
as a result  we are responsible for the complete functional and parametric performance testing of our devices  including quality 
we employ a fully staffed operations and quality organization similar to that of a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer 
we also arrange with our foundries to have online work in process control 
our approach makes the manufacturing subcontracting process transparent to our customers 
we depend on five independent foundry subcontractors located in asia to manufacture substantially all of our products 
our key silicon foundries are taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation in taiwan  chartered semiconductor manufacturing in singapore  semiconductor manufacturing international corporation in china  silterra malaysia sdn 
bhd 
in malaysia and united microelectronics corporation in singapore and taiwan  several of which maintain multiple fabrication facilities in various locations 
see risk factors under item a of this report for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on independent foundry subcontractors 
our products are currently fabricated on a variety of processes ranging from microns to nanometers 
we continuously evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies 
although the majority of our products are currently manufactured in 
microns  we are designing most new products in nanometers 
see risk factors under item a of this report for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies 
assembly and test our wafer probe testing is conducted by either our independent foundries or independent wafer probe test subcontractors 
following completion of the wafer probe tests  the die are assembled into packages and the finished products are tested by one of our two primary subcontractors for testing united test and assembly center in singapore and eems in singapore 
our eight key subcontractors for assembly are advanced semiconductor engineering in china and taiwan  amkor in korea  philippines and china  asat in china  eems test singapore in singapore and china  signetics in korea  siliconware precision in taiwan  statschippac in singapore  korea  malaysia and china  and united test and assembly center in singapore and thailand 
the availability of assembly and testing services from these subcontractors could be materially and adversely affected in the event a subcontractor experiences financial difficulties in the current global economic environment  or if a subcontractor suffers any damage to or destruction of its facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of assembly and testing capacity 
see risk factors under item a of this report for a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on third party assembly and test subcontractors 
quality assurance manufacturers of wired and wireless communications equipment demand high quality and reliable semiconductors for incorporation into their products 
we focus on product reliability from the initial stage of the design cycle through each specific design process  including layout and production test design 
in addition  we subject our designs to in depth circuit simulation at temperature  voltage and processing extremes before initiating the manufacturing process 
we prequalify each assembly and foundry subcontractor 
this prequalification process consists of a series of industry standard environmental product stress tests  as well as an audit and analysis of the subcontractor s quality system and manufacturing capability 
we also participate in quality and reliability monitoring through each stage of the production cycle by reviewing electrical and parametric data from our wafer foundry and assembly 
table of contents subcontractors 
we closely monitor wafer foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality  reliability and yield levels 
in cases where we purchase wafers on a fixed price basis  any improvement in yields can reduce our cost per chip 
as part of our total quality program  we received iso certification  a comprehensive international standards organization specified quality system acknowledgement  for our singapore facility 
all of our principal independent foundries and package assembly facilities are currently iso certified 
environmental management we monitor the environmental impact of our products 
our manufacturing flow is registered to iso  the international standard related to environmental management  by our subcontractors 
due to environmental concerns  the need for lead free solutions in electronic components and systems is receiving increasing attention within the semiconductor industry and many companies are moving towards becoming compliant with the restriction of hazardous substances directive  or rohs  the european legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances  including lead 
we believe that our products are compliant with the rohs directive 
in we began managing our compliance towards the new european reach registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals legislation 
product distribution we distribute products to our customers through our international distribution center in singapore and an operations and distribution center located in irvine  california 
our singapore facility distributes products to international destinations  while our irvine facility ships products to us destinations 
net revenue derived from actual shipments to international destinations  primarily in asia including foreign subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that are headquartered in the united states  represented   and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to achieve design wins with technology leaders in each of our targeted wired and wireless communications markets by providing quality  state of the art products  superior engineering execution  and superior sales  field application and engineering support 
we market and sell our products in the united states through a direct sales force  distributors and manufacturers representatives 
the majority of our domestic sales occur through our direct sales force  which is based in offices located in california and throughout the united states 
we have also engaged independent distributors  arrow electronics and avnet  inc  to service the north american and south american markets 
we market and sell our products internationally through regional offices located in asia  europe and north america  as well as through a network of independent distributors and representatives in asia  australia  europe and north america 
we select these independent entities based on their ability to provide effective field sales  marketing communications and technical support to our customers 
all international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
for information regarding revenue from independent customers by geographic area  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
we dedicate sales managers to principal customers to promote close cooperation and communication 
we also provide our customers with reference platform designs for most products 
we believe this enables our customers to achieve easier and faster transitions from the initial prototype designs through final production releases 
we believe these reference platform designs also significantly enhance customers confidence that our products will meet their market requirements and product introduction schedules 
backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
due to industry practice that allows customers to cancel  change or defer orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment  we do not believe that backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels 

table of contents competition wired and wireless communications markets and the semiconductor industry are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid change  evolving standards  short product life cycles and price erosion 
we believe that the principal factors of competition for integrated circuit providers in our target markets include product quality  product capabilities  level of integration  engineering execution  reliability  price  time to market  market presence  standards compliance  system cost  intellectual property  customer interface and support  and reputation 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
we compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications in our target markets 
we also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than broadcom 
this competition has resulted and will continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products 
in all of our target markets  we also may face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  and customers that choose to develop their own silicon solutions 
we also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties  and may refuse to provide us with information necessary to permit the interoperability of our products with theirs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
in addition  competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features  lower power requirements or lower costs 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property our success and future revenue growth depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
however  these measures may not provide meaningful protection for our intellectual property 
we currently hold over  us and  foreign patents and more than  additional us and foreign pending patent applications 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners  and typically control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain  copy  use or disclose our technologies and processes  develop similar technology independently  or design 
table of contents around our patents 
as such  any rights granted under our patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully enforce our patents against infringing products in every jurisdiction 
some or all of our patents have in the past been licensed and likely will in the future be licensed to certain of our competitors through cross license agreements 
moreover  because we have participated and continue to participate in developing various industry standards  we may be required to license some of our patents to others  including competitors  who develop products based on those standards 
companies in and related to the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
we are currently engaged in litigation and may need to engage in additional litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers  to protect our trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
in addition  we are currently engaged in litigation and may engage in future litigation with parties that claim that we infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets 
such litigation will result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for a detailed description of our outstanding intellectual property litigation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed under the section entitled risk factors under item a of this report 
employees as of december  we had  full time  contract and temporary employees  including  individuals engaged in research and development  engaged in sales and marketing  engaged in manufacturing operations  and engaged in finance  legal and general administrative activities 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe our employee relations are good 
item a 
risk factors before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on broadcom  our business  financial condition  results of operations and or liquidity could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our class a common stock will likely decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide political and economic uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the cyclical nature of and volatility in the semiconductor industry 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock may decline 
we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards 
from time to time  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns  such as the current downturn 
these downturns are characterized by decreases in product demand  excess customer inventories  and accelerated erosion of prices 
these factors could cause substantial fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 
in addition  during these downturns some competitors may become more aggressive in their pricing practices  which would adversely impact our gross margin 
any downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged  and any failure of the industry or wired and wireless communications markets to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to ship products 
accordingly  our operating results may vary 
table of contents significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry  which could cause large fluctuations in our stock price 
recently general worldwide economic conditions have experienced a deterioration due to credit conditions resulting from the recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and other factors  slower economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  volatility in energy costs  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the wired and wireless communications markets  the ongoing effects of the war in iraq  recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity  and the impact of natural disasters and public health emergencies 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we experienced cancellations  deferrals and a significant slowdown in orders and anticipate that trend will continue in the indeterminate future  as the current recession is projected to last at least throughout much of these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and they could cause us and foreign businesses to further slow spending on our products and services  which would delay and lengthen sales cycles 
furthermore  during challenging economic times our customers may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit  which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us 
if that were to occur  we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would be negatively impacted 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery  worldwide  or in the semiconductor industry or the wired and wireless communications markets 
if the economy or markets in which we operate do not continue at their present levels or continue to deteriorate  we may record additional charges related to restructuring costs and the impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  and our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  the combination of our lengthy sales cycle coupled with challenging macroeconomic conditions could have a synergistic negative impact on the results of our operations 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results  the market price of our class a common stock will likely decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those listed below and those identified throughout this risk factors section  some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry  current general economic volatility  and trends in the broadband communications markets in various geographic regions  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  our ability to adjust our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products and services or demand for new products requested by our customers  the effectiveness of our expense and product cost control and reduction efforts  the gain or loss of a key customer  design win or order  our dependence on a few significant customers and or design wins for a substantial portion of our revenue  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  intellectual property disputes  customer indemnification claims and other types of litigation risks  the availability and pricing of raw materials and third party semiconductor foundry  assembly and test capacity  
table of contents our ability to retain  recruit and hire key executives  technical personnel and other employees in the positions and numbers  with the experience and capabilities  and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans  our ability to timely and accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards and to identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our technologies and products in our target markets  changes in our product or customer mix  competitive pressures and other factors such as the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products  our ability to timely and effectively transition to smaller geometry process technologies or achieve higher levels of design integration  the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the impact of the internal revenue service review of certain of our income tax returns  and the effects of public health emergencies  natural disasters  terrorist activities  international conflicts and other events beyond our control 
we expect new product lines to account for a high percentage of our future sales 
some of these markets are immature and or unpredictable or are new markets for broadcom  and we cannot assure you that these markets will develop into significant opportunities or that we will continue to derive significant revenue from these markets 
based on the limited amount of historical data available to us  it is difficult to anticipate our future revenue streams from  or the sustainability of  such newer markets 
typically our new products have lower gross margins until we commence volume production and launch lower cost revisions of such products  enabling us to benefit from economies of scale and more efficient designs 
however  certain of our new products  such as products for the cellular phone market  will likely have lower gross margins than our customary products for some time after we commence volume production of those products  which will be dependent upon our product mix 
additionally  as an increasing number of our chips are being incorporated into consumer products  such as desktop and notebook computers  cellular phones and other mobile communication devices  other wireless enabled consumer electronics  and satellite and digital cable set top boxes  we anticipate greater seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our products  which may result in greater variations in our quarterly operating results 
consumer products can also have lower gross margins than the gross margins we have been able to achieve in the past  depending upon where they are in their respective product life cycles  which could negatively impact our revenue and gross margin 
in the past we have entered into arrangements that include multiple deliverables  such as the sale of semiconductor products and related data services 
under these arrangements  the services may be provided without having a separate fair value under financial accounting standards board  or fasb  emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf in that event  we will only recognize a portion of the total revenue we receive from the customer during a quarter  and will recognize the remaining revenue ratably over the respective service period or estimated product life 
there are also other scenarios under eitf and other accounting literature whereby revenue may be deferred for even longer periods or ratable recognition over the service period may not be permitted and all of the revenue may be required to be recognized in later periods or at the end of the arrangement 
as we enter into future multiple element arrangements in which the fair value of each deliverable is not known  the portion of revenue we recognize on a deferred basis may vary significantly in any given quarter  which could cause even greater fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 

table of contents we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  and our ability to accurately forecast customer demand may be impaired by our lengthy sales cycle 
if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margin 
conversely  we may have insufficient inventory  which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially in loss of market share and damaged customer relationships 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
customers can generally cancel  change or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
in the recent past  some of our customers have developed excess inventories of their own products and have  as a consequence  deferred purchase orders for our products 
it is difficult to accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is challenging because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products  are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management  and may be involved in legal proceedings that could affect their ability to buy our products 
our ability to accurately forecast customer demand may also be impaired by the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment that will incorporate our product 
our customers may need three to more than nine months to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional three to more than twelve months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we have no assurance that the customer will ultimately bring its product to market or that such effort by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or curtail  reduce or delay its product plans 
as a result of the recent significant economic downturn  which caused a decline in the cellular market  as well as tempered expectations of the future growth rate for that market  and an increase in our implied discount rate due to higher risk premiums  as well as the decline in our market capitalization  we had to adjust our assumptions used to assess the estimated fair value of our mobile platforms business group and recorded impairment charges of million in the three months ended december  relating to this group 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if we incur significant research and development expenses  marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  as an increasing number of our chips are being incorporated into consumer products  we anticipate greater fluctuations in demand for our products  which makes it even more difficult to forecast customer demand 
we place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and  in some instances  may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand 
our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to  if at all 
as a result  we could hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we could forego revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
in addition  any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins  increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
furthermore  we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these products  which has occurred in the past  our revenue and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted 
we maintain inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with certain of our customers 
our use of these arrangements increased in and we expect that we will continue to use these arrangements for the foreseeable future 
pursuant to these arrangements  we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
historically we 
table of contents have had good visibility into customer requirements and shipments within a quarter 
however  if a customer does not take our products under a hubbing arrangement in accordance with the schedule it originally provided us  our predicted future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  distributors and or customers with hubbing arrangements provide us periodic reports regarding product  price  quantity  and when products are shipped to their customers  as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
for specialized shipping terms we may also rely on data provided by our freight forwarding providers 
for our royalty revenue we also rely on data provided by our customers 
any error in the data provided to us by customers  distributors or other third parties could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenue  gross profit and net income 
additionally  since we own inventory that is physically located in a third party s warehouse  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  causing our total inventory turns to decrease  which could increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete product and negatively impact our cash flow 
if we fail to appropriately adjust our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products and services or to the demand for new products requested by our customers  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we intend to manage our costs and expenses in the short term to achieve our long term business objectives 
we anticipate that in the long term  we may need to expand as general worldwide economic conditions improve 
through internal growth and acquisitions  we significantly increased the scope of our operations and expanded our workforce from  full time  contract and temporary employees as of december  to  full time  contract and temporary employees as of december  nonetheless  we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products and services or to the demand for new products requested by our customers 
in that event  we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 
conversely  if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products  and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we expect new product lines  which often require substantial research and development expenses to develop  to account for a high percentage of our future revenue 
however  some of the markets for these new products are immature and or unpredictable or are new markets for broadcom  and if these markets do not develop at the rates we originally anticipated or if we do not execute successfully  the rate of increase in our operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase  if any  in our revenue 
moreover  we may intentionally choose to increase the rate of our research and development expenses more rapidly than the increase in the rate of our revenue in the short term in anticipation of the long term benefits we would derive from such investment 
however  such benefits may never materialize or may not be as significant as we originally believed they would be 
for instance  during the last five years we have incurred substantial expenditures on the development of new products for the cellular handset market 
approximately of the billion in research and development expense for was attributable to our mobile platforms business 
however  this market is characterized by very long product development and sales cycles due to the significant qualification requirements of cellular handset makers and wireless network operators  and accordingly  it is common to experience significant delays from the time research and development efforts commence to the time corresponding revenues are generated 
due to these lengthy product development and sales cycles  our mobile platforms business had a material negative impact on our earnings in  including impairment charges of million recorded in the three months ended december  relating to this business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in most of the revenue that we derived from our mobile platforms business related to the million in royalties we received pursuant to a patent license agreement entered into in july up to million of royalty revenue is currently expected to be recognized under this agreement in quarter ending march  as a result  after march   our mobile platforms business could have a greater dilutive impact on our results of operations 
although we currently expect to begin deriving additional revenue from our cellular handset products later in  it is possible that our customers may delay their product development plans or that their products will not be commercially successful  which would continue to materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents additionally  our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term  such as research and development expenses  the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce  stock based compensation expense  and legal  accounting and other external fees 
if we experience a slowdown in the semiconductor industry or the wired and wireless communications markets in which we operate  such as the current slowdown  we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a sufficiently timely or effective manner 
although we announced a restructuring plan in january and have implemented a number of other cost saving measures  if the current slowdown is more severe or prolonged than we anticipate  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our past growth has placed  and any future long term growth is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
to implement our current business and product plans  we will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
in the past we have implemented an enterprise resource planning system to help us improve our planning and management processes  and more recently we have implemented a new equity administration system to support our more complex equity programs as well as the adoption of sfas r 
we anticipate that we will also need to continue to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  including enhanced human resources management systems and a business to business solution  as well as additional procedures and other internal management systems 
in general  the accuracy of information delivered by these systems may be subject to inherent programming quality 
in addition  to support our growth  in march we relocated our headquarters and irvine operations to new  larger facilities that have enabled us to centralize all of our irvine employees and operations on one campus 
we may also engage in other relocations of our employees or operations from time to time 
such relocations could result in temporary disruptions of our operations or a diversion of management s attention and resources 
if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations  we may be unable to adjust our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  or conversely  we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue  either of which would materially and adversely affect our current or future business 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner or to achieve market acceptance of our new products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our future success is dependent upon our ability to develop new semiconductor products for existing and new markets  introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner  and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products 
our products are generally incorporated into our customers products at the design stage 
we often incur significant expenditures on the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product 
once an equipment manufacturer designs a competitor s product into its product offering  it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk for the customer 
even if an equipment manufacturer designs one of our products into its product offering  we have no assurances that its product will be commercially successful or that we will receive any revenue from sales of that product 
sales of our products largely depend on the commercial success of our customers products 
our customers are typically not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products if their own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason 
in addition  any substantial delay in our customers product development plans could have a material negative impact on our business 
our historical results have been  and we expect that our future results will continue to be  dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers 
the development of new silicon devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or lower than anticipated manufacturing yields in the early production of such products 
if we were to experience any similar delays in the successful completion of a new product or similar reductions in our manufacturing yields for a new product in the future  our customer relationships  reputation and business could be seriously harmed 

table of contents in addition  the development and introduction of new products often requires substantial research and development resources 
as a result  we may choose to discontinue one or more products or product development programs to dedicate more resources to new products 
the discontinuation of an existing or planned product may materially and adversely affect our relationship with our customers  including customers who may purchase more than one product from us 
our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors  including our ability to timely and accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards  accurately define new products  timely and effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets  timely complete and introduce new product designs  adjust our operations in response to changes in demand for our products and services or the demand for new products requested by our customers  license any desired third party technology or intellectual property rights  effectively develop and integrate technologies from companies that we have acquired  timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and the products of our customers into which our products will be incorporated  obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials  achieve high manufacturing yields  and shift our products to smaller geometry process technologies to achieve lower cost and higher levels of design integration 
in some of our businesses  our ability to develop and deliver next generation products successfully and in a timely manner may depend in part on access to information  or licenses of technology or intellectual property rights  from companies that are our competitors 
we cannot assure you that such information or licenses will be made available to us on a timely basis  if at all  or at reasonable cost and on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  we will be unable to attract new customers or to retain our existing customers  as these customers may transition to other companies that can meet their product development needs  which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
our operating results for and prior periods have been materially and adversely impacted as a result of the voluntary review of our past equity award practices reported in january our outstanding civil litigation relating to these matters could continue to result in significant costs to us 
in addition  any other related action by a governmental agency could result in civil or criminal sanctions against certain of our current and or former officers  directors and or employees 
in connection with the voluntary review of our past equity award practices  we restated our financial statements for each of the years ended december  through december   and for the three months ended march  accordingly  you should not rely on financial information included in the reports on forms k  q and k previously filed by broadcom  the related opinions of our independent registered public accounting firm  or earnings press releases and similar communications issued by us  for periods ended on or before march   all of which have been superseded in their entirety by the information contained in our amended annual report on form k a for the year ended december  and our amended quarterly report on form q a for the three months ended march   each filed january  in june we received an informal request for information from the staff of the los angeles regional office of the sec regarding our historical option granting practices 
in december we were informed that the sec had issued a formal order of investigation in the matter 
in april the sec brought a complaint against broadcom alleging violations of the federal securities laws  and we entered into a settlement with the sec 
without admitting or denying the sec s allegations  we agreed to pay a civil penalty of million  which we recorded as a settlement cost in  and stipulated to an injunction against future violations of certain provisions of the 
table of contents federal securities laws 
the settlement was approved by the united states district court for the central district of california in late april  thus concluding the sec s investigation of this matter with respect to broadcom 
as discussed in detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report  in may the sec filed a complaint in the united states district court for the central district of california against dr 
henry samueli  our then chairman of the board and chief technical officer  mr 
david a 
dull  our then senior vice president  business affairs and general counsel  and two other former executive officers of broadcom 
the sec s civil complaint alleges that dr 
samueli and mr 
dull  along with the other defendants  violated the anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws  falsified books and records  and caused the company to report false financial results 
we do not know when the sec action will be resolved with respect to dr 
samueli and or mr 
dull or what actions  if any  the sec may require either to take in resolution of the matter against him personally 
in august we were informally contacted by the us attorney s office for the central district of california and asked to produce documents 
in and we continued to provide substantial amounts of documents and information to the us attorney s office on a voluntary basis and pursuant to grand jury subpoenas 
we are continuing to cooperate with the us attorney s office in as widely reported  in june dr 
henry t 
nicholas  iii  our former president and chief executive officer and a former director  and william j 
ruehle  our former chief financial officer  were named in an indictment relating to alleged stock options backdating at the company 
also in june dr 
samueli pled guilty to making a materially false statement in connection with the sec s investigation described above 
in september the united states district court for the central district of california rejected dr 
samueli s plea agreement 
dr 
samueli has appealed the ruling in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
any further action by the sec  the us attorney s office or other governmental agency could result in additional civil or criminal sanctions and or fines against us and or certain of our current or former officers  directors and or employees 
additionally  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we currently are engaged in civil litigation with parties that claim  among other allegations  that certain of our current and former directors and officers improperly dated stock option grants to enhance their own profits on the exercise of such options or for other improper purposes 
although we and the other defendants intend to defend these claims vigorously  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions will be resolved without substantial costs and or settlement charges that may exceed any reimbursement we may be entitled to under our directors and officers insurance policies 
in addition  we rely on independent registered public accounting firms for opinions and consents to maintain current reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  and to have effective registration statements under the securities act of  as amended  or the securities act  on file with the sec  including our outstanding registration statements on forms s  s and s the pending arbitration proceedings involving ernst young llp  or e y  our former independent registered public accounting firm  could adversely impact our ability to obtain any necessary consents in the future from e y 
in that event  we may be required to have our new independent registered public accounting firm reaudit the affected periods and during such reaudit may not be able to timely file required exchange act reports with the sec or to issue equity  including common stock pursuant to equity awards that comprise a significant portion of our compensation packages  under our outstanding or any new registration statements 
furthermore  as a result of the reaudit  it is possible that additional accounting issues may be identified 
the resolution of the pending investigation by the us attorney s office  the defense of our pending civil litigation  and the defense of any additional litigation that may arise relating to our past equity award practices or the january restatement of our prior financial statements has in the past and could continue to result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management and other key employees 
we have indemnification agreements with each of our present and former directors and officers  under which broadcom is generally required to indemnify them against expenses  including attorneys fees  judgments  fines and settlements  arising from the pending litigation and related government actions described above subject to certain exceptions  including liabilities arising from willful misconduct  from conduct knowingly contrary to the best interests of broadcom  or conduct that is knowingly fraudulent or deliberately dishonest or results in improper personal benefit 
the 
table of contents potential amount of the future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations could be significant and could have a material impact on our results of operations  particularly as the defendants in the criminal and civil actions described above prepare to go to trial 
although we maintain various insurance policies related to the risks associated with our business  including directors and officers insurance  we cannot assure you that the amount of our insurance coverage will be sufficient  that our insurance policies will provide coverage for the matters and circumstances described above or that portions of payments by our insurance companies previously made to us will not be required to be repaid to the insurance companies as these matters reach conclusion 
certain of our insurance carriers have reserved their rights under these policies  and in the third quarter of one of our insurance carriers notified us that coverage was not available and that it intended to suspend payment to us 
as a result  we ceased receiving reimbursements under these policies for our expenses related to the matters described above 
however  in january we entered into an agreement with that insurance carrier and certain of our other insurance carriers pursuant to which  without prejudicing our rights or the rights of such insurers  we will receive a payment from these insurers under these insurance policies 
nonetheless  if our coverage under these policies is reduced or eliminated  our potential financial exposure in the pending securities litigation and related government actions would be increased 
our business  financial position and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent that our insurance coverage fails to pay or reimburse expenses and any judgments  fines or settlement costs that we may incur in connection with these matters or in the event we are required to repay amounts that were previously paid by our insurance companies 
our acquisition strategy may result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses  or be dilutive to existing shareholders 
a key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
between january  and december   we acquired companies and certain assets of four other businesses 
we continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise  including business combination transactions  strategic partnerships  and the purchase or sale of assets  including tangible and intangible assets such as intellectual property 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions  typically entail many risks  and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
we have in the past and may in the future experience delays in the timing and successful integration of an acquired company s technologies and product development through volume production  unanticipated costs and expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us 
moreover  to the extent we acquire a company with existing products  those products may have lower gross margins than our customary products  which could adversely affect our gross margin and operating results 
if an acquired company also has inventory that we assume  we will be required to write up the carrying value of that inventory to fair value 
when that inventory is sold  the gross margin for those products will be nominal and our gross margin for that period will be negatively affected 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
these challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases 
furthermore  these challenges would be even greater if we acquired a business or entered into a business combination transaction with a company that was larger and more difficult to integrate than the companies we have historically acquired 
acquisitions may require large one time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  additional stock based compensation expense  and the recording and later amortization of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets  any of which items could negatively impact our results of operations 
in addition  we may record goodwill in connection with an acquisition and incur goodwill impairment 
table of contents charges in the future 
any of these charges could cause the price of our class a common stock to decline 
beginning january   the accounting for future business combinations changed 
we expect that the new requirements will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
acquisitions or asset purchases made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves 
we may seek to obtain additional cash to fund an acquisition by selling equity or debt securities 
any issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we may issue could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a and or class b common stock 
for example  as a consequence of the prior pooling of interests accounting rules  the securities issued in nine of our acquisitions were shares of class b common stock  which have voting rights superior to those of our publicly traded class a common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from these acquisitions 
we may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations  if at all 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms  and any decline in the price of our class a common stock may make it significantly more difficult and expensive to initiate or consummate additional acquisitions 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we primarily rely on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes  it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain  copy  use or disclose our technologies and processes 
we currently hold over  us and  foreign patents and have more than  additional us and foreign pending patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued 
even if a new patent is issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any of our existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
as such  any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or file pending applications corresponding to our us patents and patent applications 
even if foreign patents are granted  effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available 
if our patents do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
some or all of our patents have in the past been licensed and likely will in the future be licensed to certain of our competitors through cross license agreements 
moreover  because we have participated and continue to participate in developing various industry standards  we may be required to license some of our patents to others  including competitors  who develop products based on those standards 
certain of our software as well as that of our customers may be derived from so called open source software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and or other third parties 
such open source software is often made available under licenses  such as the gnu general public license  or gpl  which impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software 
these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public  and or license such derivative works under a particular type of license  rather than the forms of license customarily used to protect our intellectual property 
in addition  there is little or no legal precedent for interpreting the terms of certain of these open source licenses  including the determination of which works are subject to the terms of such licenses 
while we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software  in the event that the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work  we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and or stop distribution of that work 
with respect to our proprietary software  we generally license such software under terms that prohibit combining it with open source software as described 
table of contents above 
despite these restrictions  parties may combine broadcom proprietary software with open source software without our authorization  in which case we might nonetheless be required to release the source code of our proprietary software 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  internal or external parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
also  current or former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors  and we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  current  departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our computer systems and networks to misappropriate our proprietary information and technology or interrupt our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate  counter or ameliorate these techniques 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  some of our customers have entered into agreements with us that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we fail to fulfill our obligations  including product supply obligations  under those agreements  and if we do not correct the failure within a specified time period 
also  some customers may require that we make certain intellectual property available to our competitors so that the customer has a choice among semiconductor vendors for solutions to be incorporated into the customer s products 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of strategic customers into our own designs  and have certain obligations not to use or disclose their intellectual property without their authorization 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed 
we have in the past been and currently are engaged in litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
it is possible that the advent of or developments in such litigation may adversely affect our relationships and agreements with certain customers that are either involved in such litigation or also have business relationships with the party with whom we are engaged in litigation 
such litigation and the settlement thereof has been and will likely continue to be very expensive and time consuming 
additionally  any litigation can divert the attention of management and other key employees from the operation of the business  which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
intellectual property risks and third party claims of infringement  misappropriation of proprietary rights or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties  and seriously harm our operating results 
in addition  the defense of such claims could result in significant costs and divert the attention of our management or other key employees 
companies in and related to the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
there are various intellectual property risks associated with developing and producing new products and entering new markets  and we may not be able to obtain  at reasonable cost and upon commercially reasonable terms  licenses to intellectual property of others that is alleged to read on such new or existing products 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
moreover  in the past we have been and we currently are engaged in litigation with parties that claim that we infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets 
in addition  we or our customers may be sued by other parties that claim that our products have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets  or which may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
an adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products  limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for broadcom  increase our costs of revenue  and expose us to significant liability 
any of these claims or litigation may materially and adversely affect our 
table of contents business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  a court could issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market  redesign certain products offered for sale or under development  or restrict employees from performing work in their areas of expertise 
we may also be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology  and we may be liable for treble damages if infringement is found to have been willful 
in addition  governmental agencies may commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees  former employees and or the company relating to claims of misappropriation or misuse of another party s proprietary rights 
we may also have to indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
we have received requests from certain customers and strategic partners to include increasingly broad indemnification provisions in our agreements with them 
these indemnification provisions may  in some circumstances  extend our liability beyond the products we provide to include liability for combinations of components or system level designs and for consequential damages and or lost profits 
even if claims or litigation against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management and other key employees to defend 
additionally  we have sought and may in the future seek to obtain licenses under other parties intellectual property rights and have granted and may in the future grant licenses to certain of our intellectual property rights to others in connection with cross license agreements or settlements of claims or actions asserted against us 
however  we may not be able to obtain licenses under another s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors  suppliers or customers 
we may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
our contractors  suppliers and licensors may not be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us  or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount  above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages 
in addition  we may have little or no ability to correct errors in the technology provided by such contractors  suppliers and licensors  or to continue to develop new generations of such technology 
accordingly  we may be dependent on their ability and willingness to do so 
in the event of a problem with such technology  or in the event that our rights to use such technology become impaired  we may be unable to ship our products containing such technology  and may be unable to replace the technology with a suitable alternative within the time frame needed by our customers 
because we depend on a few significant customers and or design wins for a substantial portion of our revenue  the loss of a key customer or design win or any significant delay in our customers product development plans could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities or to attract new significant customers  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we have derived a substantial portion of our past revenue from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
sales to our five largest customers represented  and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 
the identities of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
a significant portion of our revenue may also depend on a single product design win with a large customer 
as a result  the loss of any such key design win or any significant delay in the ramp of volume production of the customer s products into which our product is designed could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for instance  as a result of the recent significant economic downturn  which caused a decline in the cellular market  as well as tempered expectations of the future growth rate for that market  and an increase in our implied discount rate due to higher risk premiums  as well as the decline in our market capitalization  we had to adjust our assumptions used to assess the estimated fair value of our mobile platforms 
table of contents business 
in addition  these key design wins are often with large customers who have significantly greater financial  sales  marketing and other resources than we have and greater bargaining and pricing power  which could materially and adversely affect our operating margins 
we may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers or continue to secure key design wins for a variety of reasons  including the following most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty  our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  many of our customers have pre existing or concurrent relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect the customers decisions to purchase our products  our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products  some of our customers may choose to consolidate their supply sources to our detriment  and some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete with our products 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges 
our customers frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial portion of our resources to strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects or the development of next generation products and technologies 
delays in development could impair our relationships with strategic customers and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
in addition  our longstanding relationships with some larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
we may have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer or design win  a reduction in sales to any key customer  a significant delay in our customers product development plans or our inability to attract new significant customers or secure new key design wins could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we may be unable to attract  retain or motivate key senior management and technical personnel  which could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel  including our chief executive officer  scott a 
mcgregor  other senior executives  and our senior technical advisor  dr 
samueli 
we have employment agreements with mr 
mcgregor and certain other executive officers  however the agreements do not govern the length of their service with broadcom 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our elected officers  or any other key employees  although we do have limited change in control severance benefit arrangements in place with certain executives 
the loss of the services of mr 
mcgregor or certain other key senior management or technical personnel could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for instance  if certain of these individuals were to leave our company unexpectedly  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity during the search for and while any such successor is integrated into our business and operations 
furthermore  our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate senior management and qualified technical personnel  particularly software engineers  digital circuit designers  rf and mixed signal circuit designers and systems applications engineers 
competition for these employees is intense 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate such personnel in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis  we will experience difficulty in implementing our current business and product plans 
in that event  we may be unable to successfully meet competitive challenges or to exploit potential market opportunities  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents equity awards generally comprise a significant portion of our compensation packages for all employees 
during the time that our periodic filings with the sec were not current  as a result of the voluntary review of our equity award practices  we were not able to issue shares of our common stock pursuant to equity awards 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to attract  retain and motivate employees if we are unable to issue shares of our common stock pursuant to equity awards for a sustained period or in the event of substantial and or prolonged declines in the price of our class a common stock 
we have recently effected a number of cost saving measures and have announced a restructuring plan in january  both of which could negatively impact employee morale 
over the last few years we have also modified our compensation policies by increasing cash compensation to certain employees and instituting awards of restricted stock units  while simultaneously reducing awards of stock options 
this modification of our compensation policies and the applicability of the statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r requirement to expense the fair value of equity awards to employees have increased our operating expenses 
however  because we are mindful of the dilutive impact of our equity awards  we intend to further reduce the number of equity awards granted to employees over the next few years 
while this may have a positive impact on our operating expenses over time  it may negatively impact employee morale and our ability to attract  retain and motivate employees 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees and any increase in stock based compensation expense could each have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on five independent foundry subcontractors to manufacture substantially all of our current products  and any failure to secure and maintain sufficient foundry capacity could materially and adversely affect our business 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility 
five third party foundry subcontractors located in asia manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production 
availability of foundry capacity has at times in the past been reduced due to strong demand 
if we are unable to secure sufficient capacity at our existing foundries  or in the event of a public health emergency or closure at any of these foundries  our revenues  cost of revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
in september two of our third party foundries principal facilities were affected by a significant earthquake in taiwan 
as a consequence of this earthquake  they suffered power outages and equipment damage that impaired their wafer deliveries  which  together with strong demand  resulted in wafer shortages and higher wafer pricing industrywide 
if any of our foundries experiences a shortage in capacity  suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages  suffers an adverse outcome in pending or future litigation  or encounters financial difficulties or any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may encounter supply delays or disruptions  and we may need to qualify an alternative foundry 
our current foundries need to have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process 
we typically require several months to qualify a new foundry or process before we can begin shipping products from it 
if we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner  we may experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products 
because we rely on outside foundries  we face several significant risks in addition to those discussed above  including a lack of guaranteed wafer supply and higher wafer prices  particularly in light of the recent volatility in the commodities markets  which has the impact of increasing the cost of metals used in production of wafers  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs and other terms  and the unavailability of  or potential delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies 
the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
this often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start up of new process technologies 
poor yields from our foundries could result in product shortages or delays in product shipments  which could seriously harm our relationships with our customers and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to some of our customers  we do not have a long term volume purchase agreement or a significant guaranteed level of production capacity with any of our foundries 
foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
availability of foundry capacity has in the past been reduced from time to time due to strong demand 
foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are  or that have long term agreements with our main foundries  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them 
this reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we use five independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor products  each component is typically manufactured at only one or two foundries at any given time  and if any of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed and under acceptable terms  we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components 
also  our third party foundries typically migrate capacity to newer  state of the art manufacturing processes on a regular basis  which may create capacity shortages for our products designed to be manufactured on an older process 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries will be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields  or that our foundries will be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis  or on reasonable terms or at reasonable prices 
these and other related factors could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we may utilize new foundries for other products in the future  in using any new foundries we will be subject to all of the risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to our current foundries 
we depend on third party subcontractors to assemble  obtain packaging materials for  and test substantially all of our current products 
if we lose the services of any of our subcontractors or if these subcontractors are unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials  shipments of our products may be disrupted  which could harm our customer relationships and adversely affect our net sales 
we do not own or operate an assembly or test facility 
eight third party subcontractors located in asia assemble  obtain packaging materials for  and test substantially all of our current products 
because we rely on third party subcontractors to perform these functions  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance 
this lack of control has resulted  and could in the future result  in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could delay shipments of our products or increase our manufacturing  assembly or testing costs 
in the past we and others in our industry experienced a shortage in the supply of packaging substrates that we use for our products 
if our third party subcontractors are unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials for our products in a timely manner  we may experience a significant product shortage or delay in product shipments  which could seriously harm our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our net sales 
additionally  the recent volatility in the commodities markets could significantly increase our substrate costs 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis 
if any of these subcontractors experiences financial difficulties in the current global economic environment  suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity  or is unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials for our products  we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner 
due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components 
any problems that we may encounter with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we are continuing to develop relationships with additional third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
however  even if we use these new subcontractors  we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above 

table of contents the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects  or bugs  which could damage our reputation with current or prospective customers  result in significant costs and claims  and adversely affect the market acceptance of new products 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain hardware or software defects or bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products have previously experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
if any of our products contains defects or bugs  or has reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales or shipment of our products to customers 
to alleviate these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by us  our subcontractors  suppliers and customers  it is possible that new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or field replacement costs 
these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others  including possible claims for consequential damages and or lost profits 
moreover  we may lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
in addition  system and handset providers that purchase components may require that we assume liability for defects associated with products produced by their manufacturing subcontractors and require that we provide a warranty for defects or other problems which may arise at the system level 
to remain competitive  we must keep pace with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards and technologies 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
in addition  our target markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation 
a significant slowdown in any of these wired and wireless communications markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards make it difficult to formulate a long term growth strategy because the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we anticipate 
we have invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected 
if new markets do not develop as and when we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in those markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as our international business expands  we are increasingly exposed to various legal  business  political and economic risks associated with our international operations 
we currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside the united states 
in addition   and of our net revenue in  and  respectively  was derived from sales to independent customers outside the united states  excluding foreign subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that are headquartered in the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
products shipped to international destinations  primarily in asia  represented  and of our net 
table of contents revenue in  and  respectively 
we also undertake design and development activities in belgium  canada  china  denmark  france  greece  india  israel  japan  korea  the netherlands  spain  taiwan and the united kingdom  among other locations 
in addition  we undertake various sales and marketing activities through regional offices in a number of countries 
we intend to continue to expand our international business activities and to open other design and operational centers abroad 
the continuing effects of the war in iraq and terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad  the resulting heightened security  and the increasing risk of extended international military conflicts may adversely impact our international sales and could make our international operations more expensive 
international operations are subject to many other inherent risks  including but not limited to political  social and economic instability  exposure to different business practices and legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  natural disasters and public health emergencies  nationalization of business and blocking of cash flows  trade and travel restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls and restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  foreign technical standards  changes in taxation and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities or delayed revenue recognition  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of the factors described above may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales 
we currently operate under tax holidays and favorable tax incentives in certain foreign jurisdictions 
for instance  in singapore we operate under tax holidays that reduce taxes on substantially all of our operating income 
such tax holidays and incentives often require us to meet specified employment and investment criteria in such jurisdictions 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet such criteria or enjoy such tax holidays and incentives  or realize any net tax benefits from tax holidays or incentives 
if any of our tax holidays or incentives are terminated  our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
economic conditions in our primary overseas markets  particularly in asia  may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies 
we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 
in addition  a significant portion of our cash and marketable securities are held in non us domiciled countries 
we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets  which could reduce our market share in existing markets and affect our entry into new markets 
the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets 
we currently compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications in our target markets 
we also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than broadcom 
in all of our target markets we also may face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  and customers who choose to develop their own semiconductor solutions 
we expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 

table of contents many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
existing or new competitors may also develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality  lower power requirements  greater levels of integration or lower cost 
increased competition has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in declining average selling prices  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration  which may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products as well as standard cells and other integrated circuit designs that we may use in multiple products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs 
currently most of our products are manufactured in 
micron  
micron  
micron  
micron  nanometer or nanometer geometry processes 
although the majority of our products are currently manufactured in 
microns  we are now designing most new products in nanometers and planning for the transition to smaller process geometries 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
the transition to nanometer geometry process technology has resulted in significantly higher mask and prototyping costs  as well as additional expenditures for engineering design tools and related computer hardware 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundry subcontractors to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that the foundries that we use will be able to effectively manage the transition in a timely manner  or at all  or that we will be able to maintain our existing foundry relationships or develop new ones 
if any of our foundry subcontractors or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  we could experience reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses  all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our results of operations 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  if at all 
moreover  even if we are able to achieve higher levels of design integration  such integration may have an adverse impact on our operating results  as a result of increasing costs and expenditures as described above as well as the risk that we may reduce our revenue by integrating the functionality of multiple chips into a single chip 

table of contents we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting prior to and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective  there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could lead to a decline in our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form k 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to and report on broadcom s internal control over financial reporting 
in assessing the findings of the voluntary equity award review as well as the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for periods ended on or before march   our management concluded that there was a material weakness  as defined in public company accounting oversight board auditing standard no 
 in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  management believes this material weakness was remediated september  and  accordingly  no longer exists as of the date of this filing 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
over time  controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
as a result  we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations  or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated thereunder 
the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  leading to a decline in our stock price 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our class a common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
during our class a common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
recently we have experienced a substantial decline in the market price of our class a common stock 
fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continued volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry  current general economic volatility  trends in the broadband communications markets in various geographic regions  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  rulings in currently pending or newly instituted intellectual property litigation  
table of contents other newly instituted litigation or governmental investigations or an adverse decision or outcome in any litigation or investigations  announcements of changes in our senior management  the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets  changes in accounting rules  continuing international conflicts and acts of terrorism  changes in the methods  metrics or measures used by analysts to evaluate our stock  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of internet related  semiconductor and other technology companies have been and remain volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  we and other companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been  and we currently are  the subject of securities class action litigation 
due to the nature of our compensation programs  most of our executive officers sell shares of our common stock each quarter or otherwise periodically  often pursuant to trading plans established under rule b promulgated under the exchange act 
as a result  sales of shares by our executive officers may not be indicative of their respective opinions of broadcom s performance at the time of sale or of our potential future performance 
nonetheless  the market price of our stock may be affected by sales of shares by our executive officers 
our co founders and their affiliates can control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders  and accordingly we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without their approval 
as of december  our co founders  directors  executive officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned of our outstanding common stock and held of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
accordingly  these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders 
these matters include the election of our board of directors  the issuance of additional shares of class b common stock  and the approval of most significant corporate transactions  including certain mergers and consolidations and the sale of substantially all of our assets 
in particular  as of december  our two founders  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii and dr 
samueli  who are no longer officers or directors of broadcom  beneficially owned a total of of our outstanding common stock and held of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
because of their significant voting stock ownership  we will not be able to engage in certain transactions  and our shareholders will not be able to effect certain actions or transactions  without the approval of one or both of these shareholders and their respective spouses 
these actions and transactions include changes in the composition of our board of directors  certain mergers  and the sale of control of our company by means of a tender offer  open market purchases or other purchases of our class a common stock  or otherwise 
repurchases of shares of our class a common stock under our share repurchase program will result in an increase in the total voting power of our co founders  directors  executive officers and their affiliates  as well as other continuing shareholders 
some of the independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture our products  as well as our own california and singapore facilities  are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
one of the third party foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices is located in taiwan 
taiwan has experienced significant earthquakes in the past and could be subject to additional earthquakes 
any earthquake or other natural disaster  such as a tsunami  in a country in which any of our foundries is located could significantly disrupt our foundries production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery  or substantial shortage  of wafers and possibly in higher wafer prices 

table of contents our california facilities  including our principal executive offices and major design centers  are located near major earthquake fault lines 
our international distribution center and some of our third party foundries are located in singapore  which could also be subject to an earthquake  tsunami or other natural disaster 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one or more of our facilities are located  our operations could be significantly disrupted 
although we have established business interruption plans to prepare for any such event  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively address all interruptions that such an event could cause 
any supply disruption or business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in current or future laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impede the sale of our products or otherwise harm our business 
changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may materially and adversely impact our business 
for example  the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over each of our target markets in the united states 
although current fcc regulations and the laws and regulations of other federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to our products  they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated 
fcc regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable or satellite operators or telephone companies to offer certain services to their customers or other aspects of their business may impede sales of our products in the united states 
for example  in the past we have experienced delays when products incorporating our chips failed to comply with fcc emissions specifications 
in addition  we and our customers are subject to various import and export regulations of the united states government 
changes in or violations of such regulations could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  various government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products 
we have made numerous filings and applied for and received a number of export licenses under these regulations 
however  if we fail to continue to receive licenses or otherwise comply with these regulations  we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at our foreign foundries or to ship these products to certain customers located outside of the united states 
we and our customers may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the united states 
foreign governments may impose tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
these tariffs  duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to environmental concerns  the use of lead and other hazardous substances in electronic components and systems is receiving increased attention 
in response  the european union passed the restriction on hazardous substances  or rohs  directive  legislation that limits the use of lead and other hazardous substances in electrical equipment 
the rohs directive became effective july  we believe that our current product designs and material supply chains are in compliance with the rohs directive 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  we have in the past issued and may in the future issue shares of class b common stock in connection with certain acquisitions  upon exercise of certain stock options  and for other purposes 
class b shares have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote as compared to one vote per share in the case of our class a common stock as well as the right to vote separately as a class i as required by law and ii in the case of a proposed issuance of additional shares of class b common stock  unless such 
table of contents issuance is approved by at least two thirds of the members of the board of directors then in office 
our board of directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue shares of common or preferred stock without a shareholder vote 
it is possible that the provisions in our charter documents  the exercise of supervoting rights by holders of our class b common stock  our co founders  directors and officers ownership of a majority of the class b common stock  or the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock or additional shares of class b common stock may prevent or discourage third parties from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  these factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our class a common stock at a premium over the market price for our stock 
these factors may also materially and adversely affect voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock and the market price of our class a common stock

the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry  current general economic volatility  trends in the broadband communications markets in various geographic regions  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly in the current global economic environment  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  and the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
from time to time  our key customers place large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect that these fluctuations will continue and that they may be exaggerated by the increasing volume of our products that are incorporated into consumer products  sales of which are typically subject to greater seasonality and greater volume fluctuations than non consumer oem products 
we also maintain inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with certain of our customers 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
historically  we have had good visibility into customer requirements and shipments within a quarter 
however  if a customer does not take our products under a hubbing arrangement in accordance with the schedule it originally provided to us  our predicted future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  since we own inventory that is physically located in a third party s warehouse  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  causing our total inventory turns to decrease  which could increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete product and negatively impact our cash flow 
sales to our significant customers  including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors  as a percentage of net revenue were as follows years ended december  motorola cisco five largest customers as a group less than of net revenue 
includes sales to scientific atlanta  which was acquired by cisco in february  for all periods presented 
as we have broadened our customer base  net revenue derived from these top customers as a percentage of net revenue has decreased  even though the absolute dollars of net revenue have increased in some cases 
however  we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 
the identities of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our net 
table of contents revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
the primary factors that contributed to the decrease in net revenue from our top customers as a percentage of net revenue were i product mix changes with some of our large customers  ii new product ramps at new customers that increased our total revenues and iii royalties received pursuant to a patent license agreement entered into in july royalty revenue is currently expected to be recognized under this agreement through march  net revenue derived from all independent customers located outside the united states  excluding foreign subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that are headquartered in the united states even though such subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors are located outside of the united states  as a percentage of total net revenue was as follows years ended december  asia primarily in japan  korea  china and taiwan europe primarily in finland  france and the united kingdom other net revenue derived from shipments to international destinations  as a percentage of total net revenue was as follows years ended december  asia primarily in china  hong kong  taiwan  japan and singapore europe primarily in hungary  germany and sweden other all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
gross margin 
our gross margin  or gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix and volume of product sales including sales to high volume customers  the positions of our products in their respective life cycles  licensing and royalty revenue  the effects of competition  the effects of competitive pricing programs and rebates  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies  fluctuations in direct product costs such as wafer pricing and assembly  packaging and testing costs  and overhead costs  our ability to create cost advantages through successful integration and convergence  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  amortization of purchased intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  and reversals of unclaimed rebates and warranty reserves 
net income 
our net income has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following stock based compensation expense  required levels of research and development and other operating costs  licensing and royalty revenue  
table of contents in process research and development  or ipr d  litigation costs and insurance recoveries  settlement costs  the loss of interest income resulting from lower average interest rates and investment balance reductions resulting from expenditures on repurchases of our class a common stock  amortization of purchased intangible assets  impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  income tax benefits from adjustments to tax reserves of foreign subsidiaries  deferral of revenue under multiple element arrangements  other than temporary impairment of marketable securities and strategic investments  gain loss on strategic investments  and restructuring costs or reversals thereof 
in our net income was million including million in royalty revenue received pursuant to a patent license agreement entered into in july as compared to million in including million in royalty revenue received pursuant to a patent license agreement entered into in july  a difference of million 
this slight increase in profitability was primarily the result of a million increase in operating expenses  a decrease in interest income of million and an increase in provision for income taxes of million  offset in part by increased gross profit of million including a million net increase in royalty revenue generated from a million increase in net revenue 
net revenue in increased across each of our three target markets i broadband communications  ii mobile and wireless and iii enterprise networking 
the increase in net revenue from our broadband communications target market resulted primarily from an increase in demand for digital set top box  broadband modem  high definition dvd and digital tv products 
the increase in net revenue from our mobile and wireless target market resulted primarily from strong growth driven by new products and customer ramps for our bluetooth  wireless lan  touch controller and gps product offerings  as well as a net increase in royalty revenue in the amount of million received pursuant to a patent license agreement entered into in july  offset in part by a decrease in demand for our mobile multimedia product offerings 
the increase in net revenue from our enterprise networking target market resulted primarily from an increase in demand attributable to our ethernet switch  broadband network and security processor product lines 
operating expenses increased principally due to an increase in the number of employees engaged in operating activities  and increased mask and prototyping costs due to the continued transition of certain products to nanometer process technology 
operating expenses also increased due to i an increase in cash compensation levels since december  as a result of our annual merit increase program  ii an increase in impairment charges of goodwill and other long lived assets of million primarily related to our mobile platforms business group iii an increase in ipr d charges of million and iv settlement costs of million 
we expect research and development costs to also increase over the long term as a result of growth in  and the diversification of  the markets we serve  new product opportunities  the number of design wins that go into production  changes in our compensation policies  and any expansion into new markets and technologies 
product cycles 
the cycle for test  evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than nine months  with an additional three to more than twelve months before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development  selling  general and administrative efforts  and investments in inventory  to the time we generate corresponding revenue  if any 
the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month and quarter to quarter 
if anticipated sales or shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
mobile platforms business 
the development and introduction of new products often requires substantial research and development resources 
during the last five years we have incurred substantial expenditures on the development of new products for the cellular handset market 
approximately of the billion in research 
table of contents and development expense for was attributable to our mobile platforms business 
however  this market is characterized by very long product development and sales cycles due to the significant qualification requirements of cellular handset makers and wireless network operators  and accordingly  it is common to experience significant delays from the time research and development efforts commence to the time corresponding revenues are generated 
due to these lengthy product development and sales cycles  our mobile platforms business had a material negative impact on our earnings in  including impairment charges of million recorded in the three months ended december  relating to this business and may continue to do so until we realize significant cellular revenues 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in most of the revenue that we derived from our mobile platforms business related to the million in royalties we received pursuant to a patent license agreement entered into in july up to million of royalty revenue is currently expected to be recognized under this agreement in the quarter ending march  as a result  after march   our mobile platforms business could have a greater dilutive impact on our results of operations 
although we currently expect to begin deriving additional revenue from our cellular handset products later in  it is possible that our customers may delay their product development plans or that their products will not be commercially successful  which would continue to materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
acquisition strategy 
an element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings  augment our engineering workforce  and enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including acquisitions and other business combination transactions  strategic relationships  capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to the acquisitions made in  and in  and we completed seven acquisitions for original total equity consideration of million and total cash consideration of million 
in we acquired sunext design  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of sunext technology corporation  ltd  which specialized in the design of optical storage semiconductor products  and certain assets of the digital tv business of advance micro devices  inc  or dtv business of amd  which designs and markets applications and communications processors for the digital television market 
in we acquired lvl systems  inc  a privately held developer of production ready networking software that enables networking original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers to reduce development expenses and compress development timelines  octalica  inc  a privately held fabless semiconductor company that specializes in the design and development of networking technologies based on the moca standard  which enables distribution of high quality multimedia content throughout the home over existing coaxial cable  and global locate  inc  a privately held  fabless provider of industry leading global positioning system and assisted gps semiconductor products and software 
in we acquired sandburst corporation  a fabless semiconductor company specializing in the design and development of packet switching and routing systems on a chip that are deployed in enterprise core and metropolitan ethernet networks  and encentrus systems  inc  a developer of media center technology 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to these acquisitions 
business enterprise segments 
we operate in one reportable operating segment  wired and wireless broadband communications 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas  establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
sfas also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
our chief executive officer  who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker  reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance 

table of contents although we had four operating segments at december   under the aggregation criteria set forth in sfas we operate in only one reportable operating segment  wired and wireless broadband communications 
under sfas  two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas  if the segments have similar economic characteristics  and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas the nature of products and services  the nature of the production processes  the type or class of customer for their products and services  and the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services 
we meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons the sale of integrated circuits is the only material source of revenue for each of our four operating segments  other than royalty revenue in one of our operating segments in  the integrated circuits sold by each of our operating segments use the same standard cmos manufacturing processes  the integrated circuits marketed by each of our operating segments are sold to one type of customer manufacturers of wired and wireless communications equipment  which incorporate our integrated circuits into their electronic products  and all of our integrated circuits are sold through a centralized sales force and common wholesale distributors 
all of our operating segments share similar economic characteristics as they have a similar long term business model  operate in the long term at gross margins similar to our consolidated gross margin  and have similar research and development expenses and similar selling  general and administrative expenses 
the causes for variation among our operating segments are the same and include factors such as i life cycle including development of new products and price and cost fluctuations  ii number of competitors  iii product differentiation and iv size of market opportunity 
additionally  each operating segment is subject to the overall cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the number and composition of employees and the amounts and types of tools and materials required are similar for each operating segment 
finally  even though we periodically reorganize our operating segments based upon changes in customers  end markets or products  acquisitions  long term growth strategies  and the experience and bandwidth of the senior executives in charge  the common financial goals for each operating segment remain constant 
because we meet each of the criteria set forth in sfas and our four operating segments as of december  share similar economic characteristics  we have aggregated our results of operations into one reportable operating segment 
equity award review in january we reported the results of a voluntary review of our equity award practices 
the voluntary review  which commenced in may and covered all grants of options and other equity awards made since our initial public offering in april  was directed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
based on the results of the equity award review  the audit committee concluded that  pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations  the accounting measurement dates for most of the stock option grants awarded between june and may  covering options to purchase million shares of our class a or class b common stock  differed from the measurement dates previously used for such awards 
as a result  revised measurement dates were applied to the affected option grants and broadcom recorded a total of billion in additional stock based compensation expense for the years through after related tax adjustments of million  the restatement resulted in total net adjustments of billion for the years through this amount was net of forfeitures related to employee terminations 
the additional stock based compensation expense was amortized over the service period relating to each option  typically four years  with of the total expense recorded in years prior to in addition  million of other net adjustments was recorded in connection with our equity award review in the three months ended march  
table of contents none of the grants requiring measurement date adjustment was made to any co founders or to any current or former member of our board of directors 
as a consequence of these adjustments  our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the three years ended december  and our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheet data for the five years ended december  were restated 
we also restated the stock based compensation expense footnote information calculated under sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  under the disclosure only alternatives of those pronouncements for the years through the restated information was contained in our annual report on form k a for the year ended december   filed january  the adjustments did not affect broadcom s previously reported revenue  cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities balances in any of the restated periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition  rebates  allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  stock based compensation expense  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  strategic investments  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  uncertain tax positions  self insurance  restructuring costs  litigation and other loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue  costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following are either i critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates or assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements or ii other key accounting policies that generally do not require us to make estimates or assumptions but may require us to make difficult or subjective judgments net revenue 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
however  we do not recognize revenue when any significant obligations remain 
customer purchase orders and or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify product delivery 
we assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
in arrangements in which our semiconductor products and software are delivered concurrently and post contract customer support is not provided  we recognize revenue upon shipment of the semiconductor product  assuming all other basic revenue recognition criteria are met  as both the semiconductor products and software are considered delivered elements and no undelivered elements exist 
in limited instances in which there are undelivered elements  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair value of the individual elements 
if there is no established fair value for an undelivered element  the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue and costs for the delivered element until the undelivered element has been fulfilled 
in the case that the undelivered element is data or a support service  the revenue and costs applicable to both the delivered and undelivered elements are recorded ratably over the respective service period or estimated product life 
if the undelivered element is 
table of contents essential to the functionality of the delivered element  no revenue or costs are recognized until the undelivered element is delivered 
if we enter into future multiple element arrangements in which the fair value of each deliverable is not known  the portion of revenue we recognize on a deferred basis may vary significantly in any given quarter  which could cause even greater fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
a portion of our sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
these pricing credits and or rights of return provisions prevent us from being able to reasonably estimate the final price of the inventory to be sold and the amount of inventory that could be returned pursuant to these agreements 
as a result  the price to the customer is not fixed or determinable at the time we deliver products to our distributors 
accordingly  product revenue from sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
we also maintain inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with certain of our customers 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer reports it has removed our product from the warehouse to be incorporated into its end products 
historically  we have had good visibility into customer requirements and shipments within a quarter 
however  if a customer does not take our products under a hubbing arrangement in accordance with the schedule it originally provided to us  our future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  distributors and customers with hubbing arrangements provide us with periodic data regarding product  price  quantity  and customers when products are shipped to their customers  as well as the quantities of our products that they still have in stock 
for specialized shipping terms we may rely on data provided by our freight forwarding providers 
for our royalty revenue we rely on data provided by the licensee 
any error in the data provided to us by customers  distributors or other third parties could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenue  gross profit and net income 
we record deferred revenue when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and or services have been performed 
deferred revenue does not include amounts from products delivered to distributors that the distributors have not yet sold through to their end customers 
sales returns  pricing adjustments and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as competitive pricing programs and rebates  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
we accrue of potential rebates at the time of sale and do not apply a breakage factor 
we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end or when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid 
thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our revenue  gross profit and net income in subsequent periods 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any customer were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory and warranty reserves 
we establish inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
under the hubbing arrangements that we maintain with certain customers  we own inventory that is physically located in a customer s or third party s warehouse 
as a result  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  which would cause our total inventory turns to decrease 
in that event  our expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventory could increase and our cash flow could be negatively impacted 
our products typically carry a one to three year warranty 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we 
table of contents engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  product recalls  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure  as well as possible claims for consequential costs 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
in that event  our gross profit and gross margins would be reduced 
stock based compensation expense 
effective january  we adopted sfas r  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas r but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use the implied volatility for traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
our selection of the implied volatility approach is based on the availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of fair value than historical volatility 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected terms of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of no dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant 
we will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a further significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets  including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 

table of contents deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our cumulative losses in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  our us tax losses after tax deductions for stock based compensation  and the full utilization of our loss carryback opportunities  we have concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
in certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses  we record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance  we may record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 
in july the fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which requires income tax positions to meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements 
under fin  tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
prior to we recorded estimated income tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
litigation and settlement costs 
we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal proceedings 
we prosecute and defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past infringement or to obtain a license under the other party s intellectual property rights that could require one time license fees or running royalties  which could adversely impact gross profit and gross margins in future periods  or could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for broadcom 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such disputes or litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs

the decrease in net revenue from our enterprise networking target market resulted primarily from decreased demand for our ethernet switch and controller products 
in july we entered into a patent license agreement with a wireless network operator 
under the agreement  royalty payments will be made to us at a rate of per unit for each applicable unit sold by the operator on or after the date of the agreement  subject to certain conditions  including without limitation a maximum payment of million per calendar quarter and a lifetime maximum of million 
up to million of royalty revenue is currently expected to be recognized under this agreement in the quarter ended march  we recorded rebates to certain customers of million  or of net revenue and million  or of net revenue  in and  respectively 
we account for rebates in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  or eitf  and  accordingly  at the time of the sale we accrue of the potential rebate as a reduction to revenue and do not apply a breakage factor 
the amount of these reductions is based upon the terms included in our various rebate agreements 
we anticipate that accrued rebates will vary in future periods based upon the level of overall sales to customers that participate in our rebate programs 
we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end or when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid 
we reversed accrued rebates in the amount of million and million in and  respectively 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with our purchase of assembly  test and quality assurance services and packaging materials for semiconductor products  amortization of purchased technology  and manufacturing overhead  including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  and stock based compensation expense for personnel engaged in manufacturing support 
the increase in absolute dollars of gross profit resulted primarily from the increase in net revenue 
gross margin increased from in to in the primary factors that contributed to the increase in gross margin were i a net increase in royalty revenue in the amount of million  ii a reversal of warranty reserves of million and iii a net increase in the reversal of rebates in the amount of million related to unclaimed rebates  offset in part by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory reserves in 
table of contents the amount of million due to increased inventory levels 
for a discussion of stock based compensation included in cost of revenue  see stock based compensation expense  below 
gross margin has been and will likely continue to be impacted by our product mix and volume of product sales  including sales to high volume customers  royalty revenue  competitive pricing programs and rebates  fluctuations in silicon wafer costs and assembly  packaging and testing costs  competitive pricing requirements  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  and the introduction of products with lower margins  among other factors 
typically our newly introduced products have lower gross margins until we commence volume production and launch lower cost revisions of such products enabling us to benefit from economies of scale and more efficient designs 
our gross margin may also be impacted by additional stock based compensation expense and changes therein  as discussed below  and the amortization of purchased intangible assets related to future acquisitions 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  including stock based compensation expense 
development and design costs consist primarily of costs related to engineering design tools  mask and prototyping costs  testing and subcontracting costs 
in addition  we incur other costs related to facilities and equipment expense  among other items 
the following table presents details of research and development expense for and years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages salaries and benefits stock based compensation development and design costs other research and development includes stock based compensation expense resulting from stock options  stock purchase rights and restricted stock units we issued or assumed in acquisitions 
for a further discussion of stock based compensation expense  see the section entitled stock based compensation expense below 
the increases in salaries and benefits are primarily attributable to i a net increase in headcount by personnel predominantly as a result of our acquisition of the dtv business of amd and in the mobile and wireless area to  at december   which represents an increase from our december  levels  as well as ii an increase in cash compensation levels as a result of our annual merit review program in may in development and design costs were relatively flat  however mask and prototyping costs increased due to the continued transition of certain products to nanometer process technology  offset by reduced subcontracting costs 
development and design costs vary from period to period depending on the timing of development and tape out of various products 
the increase in the other line item included in the above table is primarily attributable to an increase in our facilities and equipment expenses 
we remain committed to significant research and development efforts to extend our technology leadership in the wired and wireless communications markets in which we operate 
we currently hold more than  us and  foreign patents  and we maintain an active program of filing for and acquiring additional us and foreign patents in wired and wireless communications and other fields 
this represents an increase of us and foreign patents issued in the last year

for a further discussion of stock based compensation expense  see the section entitled stock based compensation expense below 
the increases in salaries and benefits are primarily attributable to i a net increase in headcount by personnel to  at december   which represents an increase from our december  levels  as well as ii an increase in cash compensation levels as a result of our annual merit review program in may the remainder of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in legal and accounting fees 
legal fees consist primarily of attorney s fees and expenses related to our outstanding intellectual property and securities litigation  patent prosecution and filings  and the consummation of various transactions 
legal fees fluctuate from period to period due to the nature  scope  timing and costs of the matters in litigation from time to time  including intellectual property and securities litigation 
we have obligations to indemnify certain of our present and former directors  officers and employees to the maximum extent not prohibited by law 
under these obligations  broadcom is required to indemnify each such director  officer and employee against expenses  including attorney s fees  judgments  fines and settlements  paid by such individual in connection with our currently outstanding securities litigation and related government investigations described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements subject to certain exceptions 
the potential amount of the future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations could be significant 
we maintain directors and officers insurance policies that may limit our exposure and enable us to recover a portion of our legal fees paid related to these obligations 
however  certain of our insurance carriers have reserved their rights under these policies  and in the third quarter of one of our insurance carriers notified us that coverage was not available and that it intended to suspend payment to us 
as a result  we ceased receiving reimbursements under these policies for our expenses related to the matters described above 
however  in january we entered into an agreement with that insurance carrier and certain of our other insurance carriers pursuant to which  without prejudicing our rights or the rights of such insurers  we will receive a payment from these insurers under these insurance policies 
in the three months ended june   due to a change in the underlying facts and circumstances related to director and officer claims  we commenced recognizing reimbursements from our directors and officers insurance carriers on a cash basis  pursuant to which we record a reduction to selling  general and administrative expense only when cash is actually received from our insurance carriers instead of offsetting the expenses in a quarter with a receivable from the carriers 
in the six months ended june  we recorded a reduction of million to selling  general and administrative expense related to insurance recoveries 
no insurance proceeds were received in the second half of from inception of the securities litigation and related government investigations through december   we have recovered legal expenses in the amount of million under these insurance policies  which amount we have recorded as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expense 
in certain limited circumstances  all or portions of the amounts recovered from our insurance carriers may be required to be repaid 
we regularly evaluate the need to record a liability for potential future repayments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas as of december  we have not recorded a liability in connection with these potential insurance repayment provisions 

table of contents in connection with our currently outstanding securities litigation and related government investigations described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as of december  we advanced million to certain former officers for attorney and expert fees for which we did not receive reimbursement from our insurance carriers  and which have been expensed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if our coverage under these policies is reduced or eliminated  our potential financial exposure in the pending securities litigation and related government actions would be increased 
our business  financial position and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent that our insurance coverage fails to pay or reimburse expenses and any judgments  fines or settlement costs that we may incur in connection with these matters or in the event we are required to repay amounts that were previously paid by our insurance companies

stock based compensation expense the following table presents details of total stock based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statements of income years ended december  in thousands cost of revenue research and development selling  general and administrative the amount of unearned stock based compensation currently estimated to be expensed from through related to unvested share based payment awards at december  is billion 
of this amount  million  million  million and million are currently estimated to be recorded in   and  respectively 
the weighted average period over which the unearned stock based compensation is expected to be recognized is years 
the increase in unearned stock based compensation of million at december  from the million balance at december  was primarily the result of the fair value associated with share based awards granted during  offset in part by stock based compensation of million expensed during see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of activity related to share based awards 
we recognize stock based compensation expense related to share based awards over their respective service periods 
unearned stock based compensation is principally amortized ratably over the service periods of the underlying stock options and restricted stock units  generally months and quarters  respectively 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
charges related to the voluntary review of our equity award practices in connection with our equity award review  the results of which were reported in january  we determined the accounting measurement dates for most of our options granted between june and may covering options to purchase million shares of our class a or class b common stock  differed from the measurement dates previously used for such awards 
as a result  there are potential adverse tax consequences that may apply to holders of affected options 
by amending or replacing those options  the potential adverse tax consequences could be eliminated 

table of contents in march we offered to amend or replace options affected by the change in measurement dates by adjusting the exercise price of each such option to the lower of i the fair market value per share of our class a common stock on the revised measurement date applied to that option as a result of our equity award review or ii the closing selling price per share of our class a common stock on the date on which the option would be amended 
if the adjusted exercise price for an affected option was lower than the original exercise price  that option was not amended but instead was replaced with a new option that had the same exercise price  vesting schedule and expiration date as the affected option  but a new grant date 
the offer expired april  participants whose options were amended pursuant to the offer were paid a special cash payment with respect to those options 
the amount paid was determined by multiplying i the amount of the increase in exercise price by ii the number of shares for which options were amended 
we made payments of million in january to reimburse the affected optionholders for the increases in their exercise prices 
a liability was recorded for these payments and included in wages and related benefits as of december  in accordance with sfas r  we recorded total estimated charges of million in and a reduction of additional paid in capital in the amount of million in connection with the offer 
charges of million  million and million are included in cost of revenue  research and development expense and selling  general and administrative expense  respectively 
we also recorded total charges of million in in connection with payments we made to or on behalf of certain current and former employees related to consequences of the voluntary review of our equity award practices  as well as non cash stock based compensation expense we incurred related to the extension of the post service stock option exercise period for certain former employees 
the payments were i to remunerate participants in our employee stock purchase plan who were unable to purchase shares thereunder during the period in which we were not current in our sec reporting obligations  ii to remediate adverse tax consequences  if any  to individuals that resulted from the review  and iii to compensate individuals for the value of stock options that expired or would have expired during the period in which we were not current in our sec reporting obligations

in the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fin no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 amounts assigned to ipr d meeting the above stated criteria were charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 
the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles  and market penetration and growth rates 
the ipr d charges include only the fair value of ipr d determined as of the respective acquisition dates 
the fair value of developed technology is included in identifiable purchased intangible assets 
we believe the amounts recorded as ipr d  as well as developed technology  represent the fair values and approximate the amounts an independent party would pay for these projects as of the respective acquisition dates 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions at the acquisition dates underlying the valuations of ipr d for acquisitions completed in and weighted average average risk estimated estimated estimated adjusted percent time to cost to discount company acquired development projects complete complete complete rate ipr d in years in millions in millions acquisitions sunext blu ray application dtv business of amd xilleon product line acquisitions lvl enhancements to fastpath application platform octalica high performance communication controller global locate single chip gps device as of the respective acquisition dates  certain ongoing development projects were in process 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for the ipr d projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market 
research and development costs to bring the products of the acquired companies to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
at december  development projects for our dtv business acquisition in were still in process 
we completed all other development projects related to acquisitions 
actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  in october and in accordance with 
table of contents sfas  we compared the carrying value of each of our reporting units that existed at those times to their estimated fair value 
at october  and  we had four reporting units as determined and identified in accordance with sfas we estimated the fair values of our reporting units primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method  taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as a validation of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies 
future cash flows were discounted to present value by incorporating the present value techniques discussed in fasb concepts statement  using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements  or concepts statement specifically  the income approach valuations included reporting unit cash flow discount rates ranging from to  and terminal value growth rates ranging from to 
publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of broadcom was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology 
upon completion of the october annual impairment assessment  we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of each of the four reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value 
upon completion of the october assessment  we determined that the carrying value of our mobile platforms business group exceeded its estimated fair value 
because indicators of impairment existed for this business group  we performed the second step of the test required under sfas to determine the fair value of the goodwill of the mobile platforms business group 
in accordance with sfas  the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
as part of the second step of the impairment test performed in  we calculated the fair value of certain assets  including developed technology  ipr d assets and customer relationships 
to determine the implied value of goodwill  fair values were allocated to the assets and liabilities of the mobile platforms business as of october  the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the mobile platforms business group over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities 
the impairment loss for the mobile platforms business group was measured by the amount the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
based on this assessment  we recorded a charge of million in the three months ended december   which represented all of the related goodwill of our mobile platforms business group 
we also reviewed other long lived tangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas an impairment in the carrying value of an asset group is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
we utilized appraisals to assess the reasonableness of the fair values estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology 
based on the results of this assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the property  plant and equipment of our mobile platforms business group in the three months ended december  the primary factors contributing to these impairment charges were the recent significant economic downturn  which caused a decline in the cellular market  as well as tempered expectations of the future growth rate for that market  and an increase in our implied discount rate due to higher risk premiums  as well as the decline in our market capitalization 
we adjusted our assumptions used to assess the estimated fair value of the mobile platforms business group to account for these macroeconomic changes 
settlement costs in april we entered into a settlement with the sec relating to the previously disclosed sec investigation of broadcom s historical stock option granting practices

other income expense  net  primarily includes recorded gains and losses on strategic investments and other than temporary impairments of marketable securities  as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and dispositions of property and equipment 
the decrease in interest income  net  was the result of the overall decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in our average cash and marketable securities balances 
our cash and marketable securities balances decreased from billion at december  to billion at december   primarily due to repurchases of shares of our class a common stock 
the average interest rates earned for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the average interest rate is a reflection of the federal reserve cutting the federal funds rate from to nearly and a larger percentage of our portfolio being shifted to us treasury securities

in us operating losses were more than offset by the billion dividend 
we incurred million of state tax expense in  as a result of our billion repatriation of foreign earnings in december as a result of the utilization of million of previously reserved domestic deferred tax assets including net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards  no federal income tax expense was recognized relating to the distribution

table of contents tax benefits resulting from the reversal of certain prior period tax accruals of million and million in and  respectively 
these reversals resulted primarily from the expiration of the statutes of limitation for the assessment of taxes related to certain foreign subsidiaries 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
sfas states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our recent cumulative losses in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  and the full utilization of our loss carryback opportunities  we have concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded in such jurisdictions 
in certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in july the fasb issued fin fin provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas as a result of applying the provisions of fin  we recognized a decrease of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and a million reduction in accumulated deficit as of january  in addition we reclassified certain tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  as well as related potential penalties and interest  from current liabilities to long term liabilities 
our unrecognized tax benefits at december  and relate to various foreign jurisdictions

in certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents as a result of applying the provisions of fin  we recognized a decrease of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and a million reduction in accumulated deficit as of january  in addition we reclassified certain tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  as well as related potential penalties and interest  from current liabilities to long term liabilities 
our unrecognized tax benefits at december  relate to various foreign jurisdictions 
at december  we had unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million which included million of tax benefits that  if recognized  would reduce our annual effective tax rate 
we also accrued potential penalties and interest of million and million  respectively  related to these unrecognized tax benefits during  and in total  as of december   we had a recorded liability for potential penalties and interest of million and million  respectively

subsequent events in light of the continuing deterioration in worldwide economic conditions  on january  our board of directors committed to a restructuring plan 
the plan includes a reduction in our worldwide headcount of approximately people  which represents approximately of our global workforce 
we began implementing the plan immediately and expect that it will be substantially completed later in 
table of contents we expect to incur approximately million to million in restructuring costs related to the plan  primarily for severance and other charges associated with our reduction in workforce 
of the total restructuring costs  approximately million to million is expected to be stock based compensation expense 
we anticipate that we will recognize most of these charges in the first quarter of  with a portion to be recognized later in recent accounting pronouncements in december the fasb issued sfas no

sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engaged in were recorded and disclosed according to sfas  business combinations  until january  we expect sfas no

defensive intangible assets must be recognized at fair value in accordance with sfas r and sfas eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect eitf will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the intangible assets purchased after the effective date 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash and marketable securities 
the following table presents working capital  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities december  increase decrease in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities included in working capital 
our working capital and cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased in primarily due to repurchases of shares of our class a common stock  net cash paid for acquisitions and other purchased intangible assets and purchases of capital equipment  offset in part by cash provided by operations 
see the summary of cash  cash equivalents  short and long term marketable securities by major security type and discussion of market risk that follows in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash provided and used in and cash and cash equivalents decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  as a result of cash used in investing primarily for net purchases of marketable securities and the purchase of the dtv business of amd and financing activities primarily for repurchases of our class a common stock  offset in part by cash provided by operating activities 
december  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   we increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased net cash used in investing activities by million resulting from valuation of marketable securities to conform to the current year presentation 
in our operating activities provided million in cash 
this was primarily the result of million in net income and million in net non cash operating expenses  offset in part by 
table of contents million in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities  principally a million increase in inventory 
non cash items included in net income in consisted of depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangible assets  ipr d  impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets and losses on strategic investments and marketable securities

non cash items included in net income in included depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangible assets  ipr d  impairment of intangible assets and losses on strategic investments 
accounts receivable increased million from million at december  to million at december  our days sales outstanding decreased from days at december  to days at december   driven by a variation in revenue linearity 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net thirty day payment terms 
if  in the longer term  our revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could also increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers  both of which are more likely to occur during challenging economic times when our customers may face issues gaining access to sufficient credit on a timely basis 
inventories increased million from million at december  to million at december  related to the decline in customer demand in the fourth quarter that occurred at a rate that was faster than we could adjust for due to our lead times with our contract manufacturers 
our inventory days on hand increased from days at december  to days at december  in the future  our inventory levels will continue to be determined based upon the level of purchase orders we receive and the stage at which our products are in their respective product life cycles  our ability  and the ability of our customers  to manage inventory under hubbing arrangements  and competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
investing activities used cash of million in  which was primarily the result of net purchases of marketable securities of million  million of capital equipment purchases mostly to support our research and development efforts  million in net cash paid for the acquisition of sunext design and the dtv business of amd  and million related to contingent consideration paid to former holders of global locate capital stock and other rights for the attainment of certain performance goals by global locate 
investing activities provided cash of million in  which was primarily the result of million provided by the net proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and proceeds of million received in connection with an escrow settlement from our acquisition of siliquent  offset in part by the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our operations and the build out and relocation of our facilities in irvine  california and million net cash paid for the acquisitions of lvl  octalica and global locate and other purchased intangible assets 
our financing activities used billion in cash in  which was primarily the result of billion in repurchases of shares of our class a common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs and million in minimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for shares issued pursuant to restricted stock units  offset in part by million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercise of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
our financing activities used million in cash in  which was primarily the result of billion in repurchases of our class a common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs and million in minimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for shares issued pursuant to restricted stock units  offset by million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
during the three months ended december  we made a strategic decision to make a special one time repatriation of prior earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in the form of a billion dividend 
approximately billion of this dividend represented previously taxed income that was not subject to federal tax upon distribution 
we utilized approximately million of previously reserved domestic deferred tax assets including net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards to offset the federal tax on the remaining 
table of contents billion of dividend income  resulting in no federal income tax expense relating to the distribution 
the repatriation resulted in additional state taxes of approximately million for from time to time our board of directors has authorized various programs to repurchase shares of our class a common stock depending on market conditions and other factors 
under such programs  we repurchased a total of million  million and million shares of class a common stock at weighted average prices of  and per share  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   million was not settled in cash and was included in accrued liabilities 
this amount was subsequently paid in in july the board of directors authorized our current program to repurchase shares of broadcom s class a common stock having an aggregate value of up to billion 
repurchases under the program may be made from time to time at any time during the period that commenced july  and continuing through and including july  as of december   million was still authorized for repurchase under this plan 
due to the decrease in the average price of our class a common stock in as compared to the previous year  fewer stock options were exercised by employees  and we received reduced proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the timing and number of stock option exercises and the amount of cash proceeds we receive through those exercises are not within our control  and in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past 
moreover  it is now our practice to issue a combination of restricted stock units and stock options only to certain employees and  in most cases to issue solely restricted stock units  which will reduce the number of stock options available for exercise in the future 
unlike the exercise of stock options  the issuance of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units does not result in any cash proceeds to broadcom and requires the use of cash  as we currently allow employees to elect to have a portion of the shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock units withheld to satisfy minimum statutory withholding taxes  which we then pay in cash to the appropriate tax authorities on each participating employee s behalf 
obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  payment obligations by year thereafter total in thousands operating leases inventory and related purchase obligations other purchase obligations restructuring liabilities unrecognized tax benefits total we lease our facilities and certain engineering design tools and information systems equipment under operating lease agreements 
our leased facilities comprise an aggregate of million square feet 
our principal facilities have lease terms that expire at various dates through in march we relocated our corporate headquarters to a new facility in irvine  which currently consists of nine buildings with an aggregate of million square feet 
the lease agreement provides a term of ten years and two months  through may we have recently entered into an agreement to occupy a tenth building in  bringing the total leased space in irvine to million square feet 
the aggregate rent of million for the term of these leases is included in the table above 
inventory and related purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
we depend upon third party subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order these materials and services from subcontractors well in advance 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the 
table of contents ensuing six months 
our subcontractor relationships typically allow for the cancellation of outstanding purchase orders  but require payment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation 
to date we have not incurred significant cancellation charges 
other purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for lab test equipment  computer hardware  and information systems infrastructure  mask and prototyping costs  and other purchase commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
our restructuring liabilities represent estimated future lease and operating costs from restructured facilities  less offsetting sublease income  if any 
these costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
for purposes of the table above  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within a relatively short time horizon 
we have additional purchase orders not included in the table above that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventories or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits included in the table above  we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of million and million  respectively  at december  prospective capital needs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated from operations and from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  commitments and repurchases of our class a common stock for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies 
if needed  we may be able to raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
we could also reduce certain expenditures  such as repurchases of our class a common stock 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a common stock 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry  current general economic volatility  trends in the broadband communications markets in various geographic regions  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly in the current global economic environment  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  the overall levels of sales of our products  royalty revenue and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans  and product and technology roadmaps  the market acceptance of our products  repurchases of our class a common stock  
table of contents required levels of research and development and other operating costs  litigation expenses  settlements and judgments  volume price discounts and customer rebates  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies  royalties payable by or to us  changes in our compensation policies  the issuance of restricted stock units and the related cash payments we make for withholding taxes due from employees during and possibly during future years  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors responses to our products and our anticipation of and responses to their products  our relationships with suppliers and customers  the availability and cost of sufficient foundry  assembly and test capacity and packaging materials  and the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned future long term growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs 
off balance sheet arrangements 
at december  we had no material off balance sheet arrangements  other than our operating leases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december  we had billion in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various security holdings  types and maturities 
pursuant to sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  the fair value of all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is determined based on level inputs  which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
with the exception of one impaired investment  at december  all of our marketable securities were rated aaa  aaa  a  a or p by the major credit rating agencies 
we invest in us treasury and agency obligations  commercial paper  money market funds  corporate notes and bonds  time deposits  foreign notes and certificates of deposits 
our investment policy for marketable securities requires that all securities mature in three years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than months 
we account for our investments in debt and equity instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and fasb staff position  or fsp  sfas no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  or sfas management determines the appropriate classification of such securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date 
historically we classified our cash equivalents and marketable securities as held to maturity 
effective february we reclassified our cash equivalents and marketable securities as available for sale and recorded a net unrealized gain in the amount of million 
in cash equivalents and marketable securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
we follow the guidance provided by sfas to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income expense  net  in the consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of cash equivalents and marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices for those securities 
in we recorded an other than temporary impairment of a marketable security of million as other expense  net  in our consolidated statement of income 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates  while floating rate 
table of contents securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in the income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  the current interest rate environment may negatively impact our investment income 
in order to assess the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of december   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 
actual future gains and losses associated with our investments may differ from the sensitivity analyses performed as of december  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and level of interest rates and our actual exposures and positions 
current economic conditions have had widespread negative effects on the financial markets 
due to credit concerns and lack of liquidity in the short term funding markets  we have shifted a larger percentage of the portfolio to us treasury and other government securities and time deposits  which may negatively impact our investment income  particularly in the form of declining yields 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our business in the future
