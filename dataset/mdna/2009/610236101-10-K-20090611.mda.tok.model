this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

table of contents inventory the company evaluates whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and the company believes inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  historically the company has been able to return excess items to vendors for credit or sell such inventory to wholesalers 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require a revision in the estimates 
carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the amount paid in consideration for an acquisition in excess of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company does not amortize goodwill for acquisitions made after june  the company conducts tests for impairment of goodwill annually  typically during the third quarter of the fiscal year  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
these impairment tests include management estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including growth rates  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact the estimated fair value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that an asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the company evaluates the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used in the business by reviewing undiscounted cash flows by operating unit 
such evaluations are performed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such instances  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and the carrying values 
additionally  in the case of fixed assets related to locations that will be closed or sold  the company shortens the depreciable life of the related assets to coincide with the planned sale or closing date 
self insurance reserves the company is largely self insured with respect to workers compensation  general liability and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce its risk and better manage its overall loss exposure  the company purchases stop loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts 
the company maintains an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates take into consideration the historical average claim volume  the average cost for settled claims  current trends in claim costs  changes in the company s business and workforce  and general economic factors

 accounting for income taxes sfas 
the company s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates are calculated by legal entity and jurisdiction and are based on a number of factors  including the company s income  tax planning strategies  differences between tax laws and accounting rules  statutory tax rates and credits  uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances 
the company uses significant judgment and estimates in evaluating its tax positions 
tax law and accounting rules often differ as to the timing and treatment of certain items of income and expense

an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
the company adjusts these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  court cases and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent the company s actual tax liability differs from its established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  the company s effective tax rate may be materially impacted

are met 
these criteria demonstrate that the derivative is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or expected cash flows of the underlying exposure at both the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis and include an evaluation of the counterparty risk and the impact  if any  on the effectiveness of the derivative 
if these criteria are met  which the company must document and assess at inception and on an ongoing basis  the company recognizes the changes in fair value of such instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component
