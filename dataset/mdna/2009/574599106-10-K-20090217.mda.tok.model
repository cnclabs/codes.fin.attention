item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently believe to be immaterial  also may adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following  which we consider to be most relevant to our specific business activities 
a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity levels  both of which are experiencing a significant downturn 
a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement including repair and remodeling and new home construction activity levels  principally in north america and europe 
the new home construction market  which is cyclical in nature  is undergoing a significant downturn marked by declines in the demand for new homes  an oversupply of new and existing homes on the market and a reduction in the availability of financing for homebuyers 
the oversupply of existing homes has been exacerbated by a growing number of home mortgage foreclosures  which is further contributing to downward pressure on home prices 
unlike most previous cyclical declines in new home construction in which we did not experience comparable declines in our home improvement businesses  the current economic decline is adversely affecting our home improvement businesses as well 
low levels of consumer confidence and the downward pressure on home prices have made it much more difficult for homeowners to make additional investments in existing homes  such as kitchen and bath remodeling projects 
further  recent disruptions in credit markets have limited the ability of consumers to finance home improvements 
although we believe the long term outlook for the home improvement and new home construction markets is favorable  we cannot provide any assurances that current market conditions will not deteriorate further and we cannot predict the timing or strength of a recovery in these markets 
continued depressed activity levels in consumer spending for home improvement and new home construction will continue to adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position 
furthermore  continued economic turmoil may cause unanticipated shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and in the business models and strategies of our customers 
such shifts may alter the nature and prices of products demanded by the end consumer and our customers and could adversely affect our operating performance 
continued disruption in the financial markets could harm our business 
we  our customers and end consumers rely on stable and efficient financial markets 
the credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced significant disruptions  characterized by 
table of contents the bankruptcy and failure of several financial institutions and severe limitations on credit availability 
the disruptions in the financial markets have adversely affected  and could continue to adversely affect  our operations in a variety of ways 
the financial stability of certain of our customers has been negatively impacted  which has resulted in increased bad debt expense for us 
a prolonged continuation of adverse economic conditions would cause additional financial distress for our customers and could compromise the financial condition of our suppliers  which could result in non performance by certain of our suppliers 
in addition  our own borrowing costs are increasing and our access to capital markets may be reduced 
in december  our senior debt ratings were lowered by two credit rating agencies  including by one agency to below investment grade 
as a result of the general deterioration in financial markets  as well as the lowering of our credit ratings  costs under our existing credit facilities have increased and may continue to increase  and it may become more difficult for us to obtain financing to fund operations or to refinance our existing debt obligations 
further  the dramatic deterioration in general economic conditions over the past several months has resulted in the decline in the value of our investments in debt and equity securities  including the assets held in our pension plans 
a prolonged economic downturn would reduce our financial resources and flexibility 
the valuation of assets on our balance sheet  particularly goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses 
the reduced expectations of future performance have caused us to recognize impairment charges for certain long lived assets  including goodwill  and a continuation of the adverse conditions in our markets may result in additional impairment charges and a reduction in our shareholders equity in the future 
such a reduction in our shareholders equity and other adverse effects of a prolonged economic downturn on our results of operations and financial position would reduce our financial resources and flexibility and increase the relative impact on the company of other developments that otherwise affect us 
we rely on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our distribution channels 
the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated or exited the business 
larger customers can effect significant changes in their volume of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services  our costs of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business 
further  as discussed above  during downturns in our markets  declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers may impact the volume of our business  the credit risk involved and our terms of doing business with them 
sales of our home improvement and building products to home center retailers are substantial 
in  sales to our largest customer  the home depot  were billion approximately percent of our consolidated net sales 
lowe s is our second largest customer 
in  our sales to lowe s were less than percent of our consolidated net sales 
although homebuilders  dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for our products and services  the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of our sales to lowe s would have a material adverse effect on our business 
as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers  conflicts between our existing distribution channels have occurred  and will continue to occur 
in addition  we may undermine the business relationships we have with customers who purchase our products through traditional wholesale channels as we increase the amount of business we transact directly with our larger customers 
in addition  our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity  which may affect the products we can offer to other customers 

table of contents our principal markets are highly competitive 
the major geographic markets for our products and services are highly competitive and  in recent years  competition has intensified significantly 
competition is further exacerbated during economic downturns 
home center retailers are increasing their purchases of products directly from manufacturers  particularly low cost suppliers in asia  for sale as private label and house brand merchandise 
also  home center retailers  which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers  are increasingly turning their marketing efforts directly toward professional contractors and installers 
we believe that competition in our industries is based largely on price  product and service quality  brand reputation  customer service and product features and innovation 
although the relative importance of such factors varies among customers and product categories  price is often a primary factor 
in addition to the challenges we are facing as a result of the current economic downturn  our ability to maintain our competitive positions in our markets and to grow our businesses depends to a large extent upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers  implementing growth strategies in our existing markets and entering new geographic markets  capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names  managing our cost structure  accommodating shorter life cycles for our products and product development and innovation 
the cost and availability of materials and the performance of our supply chain affect our operating results 
it has been  and likely will continue to be  difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases for commodities or other materials that are major components of our products or services 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs as part of our strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to purchase supplies at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices 
delays in adjusting  or in our inability to adjust  selling prices may be due to factors such as our existing arrangements with customers  competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases 
further  when commodity prices decline  we receive pressure from our customers to reduce prices for our products and services 
changes in energy costs and certain commodities not only impact our production costs  but also the cost to transport our products 
we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia 
the distances involved in these arrangements  together with differences in business practices  shipping and delivery requirements  the limited number of suppliers  and laws and regulations  have increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain  the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling 
we rely heavily or exclusively on outside suppliers for certain of our products or key components 
if there is an interruption in these sources of supply  we may experience difficulty or delay in substituting alternatives and our business may be disrupted 
international political  monetary  economic and social developments affect our business 
over percent of our sales are derived outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally european euros and great britain pounds 
in addition  we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia 
our international business faces risks associated with changes in political  monetary  economic and social environments  labor conditions and practices  the laws  regulations and policies of foreign governments  cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 
us laws affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad  including tax laws and laws regulating various business practices  also impact our international business 
our international operating results may be influenced  when compared to our north american results  in part due to relative economic conditions in the european markets and due to competitive pricing pressures on certain products 
the financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations 
table of contents in currency exchange rates  which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period and in forecasting future performance 
we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets  including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 
we have maintained investments in available for sale securities including marketable and auction rate securities and a number of private equity funds 
since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds  they are for the most part illiquid 
these investments  by their nature  can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk  including financial leverage  than other financial investments 
future changes in market conditions  the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation 
in addition  we have commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund 
product liability claims and other litigation could be costly 
we are subject to product safety regulations  recalls and direct claims for product liability  including putative class actions 
product liability claims can result in significant liability and  regardless of the ultimate outcome  can be costly to defend 
also  we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell 
as a result of the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers  we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 
we have experienced putative class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations  product liability and wage and hour issues 
we have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases 
however  even when there is no basis for imposing liability  such lawsuits are particularly costly to resolve due to their scope and complexity and the potentially significant exposure that is alleged 
increasingly  homebuilders  including our customers  are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business 
our contractual arrangements with these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify them against liability for the performance of our products or services or the performance of other products that we install 
these claims  often asserted several years after completion of construction  frequently result in lawsuits against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors  including us  and require us to incur defense costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 
see note u to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 
government and industry responses to environmental and health and safety concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating results 
government regulations pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees as well as consumers and environmental concerns continue to emerge  domestically as well as internationally 
in addition to having to comply with current requirements including requirements that do not become effective until a future date  even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future 
compliance with these regulations such as the restrictions on lead content in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to certain of our businesses may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing 
such actions could adversely impact our operating results  and our ability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position 

table of contents the long term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract  develop and retain talented management 
to be successful  we must attract  develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel in management  sales  marketing and product design and innovation and  as we consider entering new international markets  skilled personnel familiar with these markets 
we compete with multinational firms for these employees and we invest significant resources in recruiting  developing  motivating and retaining them 
the failure to attract  develop  motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the financial and business analysis below provides information which the company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting the company s views about its future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and  accordingly  the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
readers should consider that various factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors of this report  the executive level overview  critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections  may affect the company s performance 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
executive level overview the company manufactures  distributes and installs home improvement and building products 
these products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home centers  home builders  distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 
during  the company experienced a significant decline in its markets  including a decline in new home construction of over percent from  as well as a continued decline in consumer spending for home improvement products 
the company s net sales decreased percent in from and the company s operating profit as adjusted to exclude impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets  general corporate expense  net  gains on sale of fixed assets  net and charge for litigation settlement declined to percent of sales in from percent of sales in factors that affect the company s results of operations include the levels of home improvement activity and new home construction principally in north america and europe  the importance of and the company s relationships with key customers including the home depot  which represented approximately percent of the company s net sales in  the company s ability to maintain its leadership positions in its us and global markets in the face of increasing competition and the company s ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure  including the cost and availability of labor and materials 
if the current market conditions  including the rate of consumer spending for home improvement products and new home construction  continue or deteriorate further  the company s results of operations would continue to be negatively impacted 
the company cannot provide any assurances that current market conditions affecting the home improvement and new home construction markets will not deteriorate further and the company cannot predict the timing or strength of a recovery in these markets 
the company s international businesses face political  monetary  economic and other risks that vary from country to country  as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
further  the company has financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk  particularly in the current uncertain economic and credit market conditions 
in addition  product liability claims and other litigation could be costly 
these and other factors are discussed in more detail in item a risk factors of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
table of contents the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience  as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables the company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered 
the company records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the installation and other services segment  such amounts are recorded in receivables 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing and co operative advertising arrangements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
in addition  the company monitors its customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of its customers on an on going basis 
during downturns in our markets  declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and the company has incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer defaults 
the company s bad debt expense was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
in north america  the company manufactures products principally windows  doors and cabinets and provides installation of insulation and other services to homebuilders 
the company s bad debt expense related to homebuilders was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on an on going basis  the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 
financial investments on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
for its financial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas no 
further defines a fair value hierarchy for measurement and disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments  as follows level inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs as observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data  and level inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
financial investments that are available to be traded on readily accessible stock exchanges domestic or foreign are considered to have active markets and have been valued using level inputs 
financial 
table of contents investments that are not available to be traded on a public market or have limited secondary markets  or contain provisions that limit the ability to sell the investment are considered to have inactive markets and have been valued using level or inputs 
the company incorporated credit risk into the valuations of financial instruments by estimating the likelihood of non performance by the counterparty to the applicable transactions 
the estimate included the length of time relative to the contract  financial condition of the counterparty and current market conditions 
the criteria for estimating if a market was active or inactive were based on the individual facts and circumstances 
the company has maintained investments in available for sale securities and a number of private equity funds  which aggregated million and million  respectively  at december  investments in available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized  net of tax effect  through shareholders equity  as a component of other comprehensive income in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the company s investments in available for sale securities is estimated using primarily level inputs 
the fair value of the company s investment in asahi tec preferred stock is estimated using a discounted cash flow model level input 
if the company changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by basis points  the value of the asahi tec preferred stock would change by approximately four percent 
the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be other than temporary 
during  the company recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges of million related to its investment in trimas common stock and million related to its investment in asahi tec common stock 
in the past  the company invested excess cash in auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every  or days 
at december   the company s investment in auction rate securities was million  the company has not increased its investment in auction rate securities since the fair value of auction rate securities is estimated based on a discounted cash flow model level input 
if the company changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by basis points  the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately million 
the company s investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost 
it is not practicable for the company to estimate a fair value because the private equity funds have no quoted market price and sufficient information is not readily available for the company to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund 
these investments are evaluated quarterly for potential other than temporary impairment when impairment indicators are present  or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred  that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
impairment indicators the company considers include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance  asset quality or business prospects  a significant adverse change in the regulatory  economic or technological environment  a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates  industry and sector performance  current equity and credit market conditions  and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value 
the company also considers specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund  including industry and sector performance 
the significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential other than temporary impairment include current economic conditions  market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in the automotive and transportation  residential and commercial construction  bio technology  health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds investments operate 
at december   the company had investments in venture capital funds  with an aggregate carrying value of million 
the venture capital funds invest in start up or smaller  early stage established businesses  principally in the information technology  bio technology and health care sectors 
at december   the company also has investments in buyout funds  with an aggregate carrying 
table of contents value of million 
the buyout funds invest in later stage  established businesses and  other than the heartland industrial partners fund heartland fund which is primarily in the automotive and transportation sector  no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector 
since there is no active trading market for these investments  they are for the most part illiquid 
these investments  by their nature  can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk  including financial leverage  than other financial investments 
the timing of distributions from the funds  which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments  as well as the funds schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash  can be difficult to predict 
as a result  the amount of income that is recorded from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
future changes in market conditions  the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
during  as a result of the company s review of its private equity investments  the company determined that the heartland fund was negatively impacted by the decline in north american automotive production and the expected continued decline in automotive production in in addition  five funds with limited exposure to the residential and commercial construction markets were negatively impacted by the decline in housing starts and the expected continued decline in  as well as a slow down in commercial construction  these conditions resulted in the impairment of certain investments within these five funds 
during  the company recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges aggregating million related to these investments in private equity funds 
therefore  these six funds now have a carrying value of million at december  if automotive production were to decline further than expected in or continue for a period of time at lower than normal historical production rates  the heartland fund could have an additional impairment charge in a range of million 
the company expects that a continued decline in the residential and commercial construction markets would not have a significant impact on the five private equity funds that recorded an impairment charge in  as their remaining investments are diversified outside the residential and commercial construction sectors 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in the fourth quarter of each year  or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
the company selected the discounted cash flow methodology as the company believes that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants 
the company has defined its reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level  as defined by sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company s operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities  for which discrete financial information  including five year forecasts  are available 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
the company s judgments are based upon historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes 
in estimating future cash flows  the company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures  and generally a one to three percent long term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast 
the company generally develops these forecasts based upon  among other things  recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 

table of contents in  for its reporting units that primarily sell to the new home construction market including those in the installation and other services segment  the company utilized estimated housing starts growing from current levels to million in terminal growth year and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical margins for those business units by terminal growth year 
the housing starts projections were obtained from independent industry sources and discounted by approximately ten percent 
in  the company estimated housing starts growing from million units in to million units in terminal growth year 
in and  the company generally utilized its weighted average cost of capital discount rate of approximately nine percent to discount the estimated cash flows 
due to the market conditions in  the company increased the discount rate for certain of its reporting units  based upon a review of the current risks impacting its businesses 
in the fourth quarter of  the company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting units were greater than the carrying values 
any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company measures the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
in  the company recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of million million  after tax 
the pre tax impairment charges  related to three of the company s united kingdom manufacturers and distributors  recorded in were as follows cabinets and related products segment million  plumbing products segment million  and other specialty products segment million  these impairment charges reflect the anticipated long term outlook for the reporting units  including declining demand for certain products  as well as decreased operating profit margins 
the pre tax impairment charge in the installation and other services segment  related to a small installation service reporting unit in north america  was million  and reflects a decline in the reporting unit s anticipated long term outlook 
a ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units at december  would have resulted in a step two analysis and probable goodwill impairment for one reporting unit in the cabinets and related products segment  one reporting unit in the installation and other services segment and one reporting unit in the other specialty products segment 
the company reviews its other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  in the fourth quarter  or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit 
the company considers the implications of both external eg  market growth  competition and local economic conditions and internal eg  product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term 
in  the company recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges for other indefinite lived intangible assets of million million  after tax 
the pre tax impairment charges recorded in were as follows installation and other services segment million  and other specialty products segment million 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 

table of contents stock based compensation the company s long term stock incentive plan the plan provides for the issuance of stock based incentives in various forms to employees and non employee directors 
at december   outstanding stock based incentives were in the form of long term stock awards  stock options  phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights 
the company elected to begin recording expense for stock options granted or modified subsequent to january  effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application mpa method 
the mpa method requires the company to recognize expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to january  through the remaining vesting periods 
the mpa method did not require the restatement of prior year information 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the company utilized the shortcut method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock options as of the date of adoption 
long term stock awards long term stock awards are granted to key employees and non employee directors of the company and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as the company continues the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market 
the company measures compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of the company s common stock at the grant date 
there was million eight million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december   which was included as a reduction of common stock and retained earnings 
effective january   such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards  typically years except for stock awards held by grantees age or older  which vest over five years  or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age for stock awards granted prior to january   such expense is being recognized over the vesting period of the stock awards  typically years  or for executive grantees that are  or will become  retirement eligible during the vesting period  the expense is being recognized over five years  or immediately upon a grantee s retirement 
pre tax compensation expense for the annual vesting of long term stock awards was million for stock options stock options are granted to key employees and non employee directors of the company 
the exercise price equals the market price of the company s common stock at the grant date 
these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than years after the grant date 
the plan does not permit the granting of restoration stock options  except for restoration options resulting from options granted under the company s previous plan 
restoration stock options become exercisable six months from the date of grant 
the company measures compensation expense for stock options using a black scholes option pricing model 
for stock options granted subsequent to january   such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options  typically five years  or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age the expense for unvested stock options at january  is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a black scholes option pricing model for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
for stock options granted prior to january   such expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock options  typically five years 
pre tax compensation expense for stock options was million for the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility factor and expected option life years 
for sfas no 
r calculation purposes  the 
table of contents weighted average grant date fair value of option shares  including restoration options  granted in was per option share 
if the company increased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in would increase percent 
if the company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in would decrease percent 
employee retirement plans accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future  based upon vested years of service  and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works 
pension costs and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within the company s consolidated financial statements 
in  the company decreased its discount rate for obligations to an average of percent from percent 
the discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected duration of each defined benefit pension plan s liabilities matched to the december  citigroup pension discount curve 
such rates for the company s defined benefit pension plans ranged from percent to percent  with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of percent or higher 
the assumed asset return was primarily percent  reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets 
the company s net underfunded amount for its qualified defined benefit pension plans  the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets  increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to a decline in asset values  in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas no 
 the underfunded amount has been recognized on the company s consolidated balance sheets at december  and qualified domestic pension plan assets in had a net loss of approximately percent compared to average losses of percent for the corporate funds universe within the independent consultant cooperative 
the company s projected benefit obligation for its unfunded non qualified defined benefit pension plans was million at december  compared with million at december   in accordance with sfas no 
 the unfunded amount has been recognized on the company s consolidated balance sheets at december  and the company expects pension expense for its qualified defined benefit pension plans to be million in compared with million in if the company assumed that the future return on plan assets was one half percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by basis points  the pension expense would increase by million 
the company expects pension expense for its non qualified defined benefit pension plans to be million in compared with million in given the significant market decline in asset values for the company s qualified defined benefit pension plans  the company has several funding options and credits available and anticipates that it will be required to increase its funding to meet erisa requirements by between million and million in 
table of contents income taxes the company has considered potential sources of future taxable income in determining the amount of a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in the company s effective tax rate 
historically  the company established reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  sfas no 

under this standard  reserves for tax contingencies were established when it was probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin no 

fin no 
allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
the adoption of fin no 
was effective january  fin no 
establishes a lower threshold than sfas no 
for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions referred to by fin no 
as unrecognized tax benefits 
therefore  the company believes that there is a greater potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits computation to a greater degree than with sfas no 
while the company believes it has adequately provided for its uncertain tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
accordingly  additional provisions for tax related matters  including interest and penalties  could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
other commitments and contingencies certain of the company s products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product 
at the time of sale  the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products  parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent that the company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 
the majority of the company s business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers 
a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return 
however  certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the company 
the company s revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue  and deductions are recorded at the time of sale 
the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
when estimates of the company s exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under sfas no 
 amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ due to subsequent developments 
see note u to the company s consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings involving the company 

table of contents corporate development strategy in past years  acquisitions have enabled the company to build strong positions in the markets it serves and have increased the company s importance to its customers 
the company s more recent focus includes the rationalization of its business units  including consolidations  as well as pursuing synergies among the company s business units 
the company expects to maintain a more balanced growth strategy with emphasis on organic growth and fewer acquisitions with increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital 
as part of its strategic planning  the company continues to review all of its businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to the company s long term growth strategy 
during  the company determined that several european business units were not core to the company s long term growth strategy and  accordingly  embarked on a plan of disposition 
in separate transactions  the company completed the sale of three business units in europe  including two in the plumbing products segment and one in the other specialty products segment 
the company recorded an impairment of assets related to these discontinued operations which primarily included the write down of goodwill of million and other assets of million 
the company recognized a net gain of million in  primarily related to the discontinued operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company accounted for the business units which were sold in  and  as discontinued operations 
there were no businesses held for sale at december  see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
during  the company acquired a relatively small countertop business cabinet and related products segment 
this business  which allows the company to expand the products and services it offers to its customers  had annual sales of over million 
the results of this acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the aggregate net purchase price for this acquisition was million and included cash of million and future cash payments of million 
during  the company acquired several relatively small installation service businesses installation and other services segment  as well as erickson construction company and guy evans  inc installation and other services segment 
the results of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations  long term bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets  and by the issuance of company common stock  including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 
maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the company s financial strategies 
the company s total debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to percent at december  from percent at december  the increase is primarily due to the decline in shareholders equity due to share repurchases  the decline in the fair value of pension assets  the effect of currency translation and the net loss including impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in bank credit lines are maintained to provide for the availability of funds 
at december   the company had a billion five year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks syndicated in the united states and internationally  which expires in february this agreement allows for borrowings denominated in us dollars or european euros with interest payable based upon various floating rate options as selected by the company 
at december   there are no amounts outstanding under the five year revolving credit facility and there are no current plans to utilize this facility 
in light of the recent financial market turmoil  the company has confirmed with jpmorgan chase bank  the agent for this facility  that the obligations of merrill lynch and wachovia bank  as participating lenders under this facility  have been assumed by bank of america and wells fargo bank  respectively  in 
table of contents connection with the completion of the transactions to combine these entities 
both bank of america and wells fargo bank were already participating lenders under the company s credit facility 
the five year revolving credit agreement  as amended  contains limitations on additional borrowings  related to the debt to total capitalization requirements  at december   the company had additional borrowing capacity  subject to availability  of up to million 
the five year revolving credit agreement also contains a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth  at december   the company s net worth exceeded such requirement by million 
based on the credit agreement  the net worth covenant is adjusted on an annual basis 
on a pro forma basis  as of january   the company s net worth  including the minority interest reclassification of million upon adoption of sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 would have exceeded the requirement by approximately million 
in addition  at january   the company could borrow approximately million or absorb a reduction to shareholders equity of approximately million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant 
in order to borrow under the five year revolving credit agreement  there must not be any defaults in the company s covenants in the credit agreement ie  in addition to the two financial covenants  principally limitations on subsidiary debt  negative pledge restrictions  legal compliance requirements and maintenance of insurance and the company s representations and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all material respects on the date of borrowing ie  principally no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change  in each case since december   no material erisa or environmental non compliance and no material tax deficiency 
the company was in compliance with all debt covenants at december  and a credit rating agency ie  moody s or standard and poor s is an entity that assigns credit ratings for issuers of certain types of debt obligations 
in december  one rating agency reduced the credit rating on the company s debt to below investment grade 
as a result  the zero coupon convertible senior notes notes are convertible on demand and the balance of million has been classified as short term debt at december  the company does not anticipate conversion of the notes since  based on the terms  it would not currently be profitable for holders of the notes to exercise the option to convert the notes 
also  as a result of the downgrade  the costs related to the five year revolving credit agreement will be higher 
as a result of the general deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions  as well as the lowering of the company s credit ratings  it may become difficult to obtain financing to fund operations or to refinance the company s existing debt obligations 
the company had cash and cash investments of billion at december  principally as a result of strong cash flows from operations 
the company s cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts  money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations 
while the company attempts to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk  it is possible that the recent global turmoil in the financial markets could result in failures of additional financial institutions or other events and thereby affect the security or availability of these investments 
the company has maintained investments in available for sale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds  principally as part of its tax planning strategies  as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax losses 
the company determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous to the company and complement the company s investment in more liquid available for sale and marketable securities to balance risk 
since the company has significantly reduced its capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources  the company has and will continue to reduce its investments in long term financial assets 

table of contents in  the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend two percent to 
per common share 
given the continued uncertainty in the global economic and financial markets  the company will focus on liquidity preservation

these swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges and were considered percent effective 
the gain of million from the termination of these swaps is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt  through july the company  including certain european operations  has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations  primarily related to the european euro and the us dollar 
at december   the company had also entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge currency fluctuations related to intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies

the company continues to evaluate the requirements for reinvestment in the business  working capital  common stock dividends and common stock repurchases in relation to its cash balances  cash flows  financial resources and financial market conditions 
the company believes that its present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund its near term working capital and other investment needs 
the company believes that its longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and  to the extent necessary  from bank borrowings and future financial market activities 
further  in connection with this review  given the turmoil in the financial markets and challenging new home construction and home improvement markets  the company has not repurchased any shares since july and does not anticipate further repurchases under current conditions
