overview energy services was formed on march   to serve as a vehicle to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business 
it operated as a blank check company until august  at which time it completed the acquisitions of st pipeline  inc and c j hughes construction company  inc st pipeline and st hughes are considered predecessor companies to energy services 
the discussion of financial condition and operating results include the results of the two predecessors prior to the acquisition 
this discussion is based in part on pro forma income statement information for the year ended september  the company acquired st pipeline for million in cash and million in a promissory note 
the c j hughes purchase price totaled million  one half of which was in cash and one half in energy services common stock 
the acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method and the financial results of both acquisitions are included in the results of energy services from the date of acquisition 
since the acquisitions  energy services has been engaged in the providing of contracting services for energy related companies 
currently energy services primarily services to the gas  oil and electrical industries though it does some other incidental work 
for the gas industry  the company is primarily engaged in the construction  replacement and repair of natural gas pipelines and storage facilities for utility companies and private natural gas companies 
energy services is involved in the construction of both interstate and intrastate pipelines  with an emphasis on the latter 
for the oil industry the company provides a variety of services relating to pipeline  storage facilities and plant work 
for the electrical industry  the company provides a full range of electrical installations and repairs including substation and switchyard services  site preparation  packaged buildings  transformers and other ancillary work with regards thereto 
energy services other services include liquid pipeline construction  pump station construction  production facility construction  water and sewer pipeline installations  various maintenance and repair services and other services related to pipeline construction 
the majority of the company s customers are located in west virginia  virginia  ohio  kentucky and north carolina 
the company builds  but does not own  natural gas pipelines for its customers that are part of both interstate and intrastate pipeline systems that move natural gas from producing regions to consumption regions as well as building and replacing gas line services to individual customers of the various utility companies 
the company had consolidated operating revenues of million for the year ended september  of which was attributable to gas work  to electrical services customers  and for water and sewer installation and other ancillary services 
energy services customers include many of the leading companies in the industries it serves  including marathon ashland petroleum llc  spectra energy  equitable resources  hitachi and nisource 
the company enters into various types of contracts  including competitive unit price  cost plus or time and materials basis and fixed price lump sum contracts 
the terms of the contracts will vary from job to job and customer to customer though most contracts are on the basis of either unit pricing in which the company agrees to do the work for a price per unit of work performed or for a fixed amount for the entire project 
most of the company s projects are completed within one year of the start of the work 
on occasion  the company s customers will require the posting of performance and or payment bonds upon execution of the contract  depending upon the nature of the work performed 
the company generally recognizes revenue on unit price and cost plus contracts when units are completed or services are performed 
fixed price contracts usually results in recording revenues as work on the contract progresses on a percentage of completion basis 
under this accounting method  revenue is recognized based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
many contacts also include retainage provisions under which a percentage of the contract price is withheld until the project is complete and has been accepted by the customer 
seasonality fluctuation of results our revenues and results of operations can and usually are subject to seasonal variations 
these variations are the result of weather  customer spending patterns  bidding seasons and holidays 
the first quarter of the calendar year is typically the lowest in terms of revenues because inclement weather conditions causes delays in production and customers usually do not plan large projects during that time 
while usually better than the first quarter  the second quarter often has some inclement weather which can cause delays in production  reducing the revenues the company receives and or increasing the production costs 
the third quarter usually is least impacted by weather and usually has the largest number of projects underway 
the fourth quarter is usually lower than the third due to the various holidays 
many projects are completed in the fourth quarter and revenues are often impacted by customers seeking to either spend their capital budget for the year or scale back projects due to capital budget overruns 
in addition to the fluctuations discussed above  the pipeline industry can be highly cyclical  reflecting variances in capital expenditures in proportion to energy price fluctuations 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by where our customers are in the cycle and thereby their financial condition as to their capital needs and access to capital to finance those needs 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter or year may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or any other year 
you should read understanding gross margins and outlook below for discussions of trends and challenges that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
understanding gross margins our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries  wages and some benefits to employees  depreciation  fuel and other equipment costs equipment rentals  subcontracted services  portions of insurance  facilities expense  materials and parts and supplies 
various factors  some controllable  some not impact our gross margin on a quarterly or annual basis 
seasonal 
as discussed above  seasonal patterns can have a significant impact on gross margins 
usually  business is slower in the winter months versus the warmer months 
weather 
adverse or favorable weather conditions can impact gross margin in a given period 
periods of wet weather  snow or rainfall  as well as severe temperature extremes can severely impact production and therefore negatively impact revenues and margins 
conversely  periods of dry weather with moderate temperatures can positively impact revenues and margins due to the opportunity for increased production and efficiencies 
revenue mix 
the mix of revenues between customer types and types of work for various customers will impact gross margins 
some projects will have more margins while others that are extremely competitive in bidding may have narrower margins 
service and maintenance versus installation 
in general  installation work has a higher gross margin than maintenance work 
this is due to the fact that installation work usually is more of a fixed price nature and therefore has higher risks involved 
accordingly  a higher portion of the revenue mix from installation work typically will result in higher margins 
subcontract work 
work that is subcontracted to other service providers generally has lower gross margins 
increases in subcontract work as a percentage of total revenues in a given period may contribute to a decrease in gross margin 
materials versus labor 
typically materials supplied on projects have smaller margins than labor 
accordingly  projects with a higher material cost in relation to the entire job will have a lower overall margin 
depreciation 
depreciation is included in our cost of revenue 
this is a common practice in our industry  but can make comparability to other companies difficult 
margins on job 
failure to properly execute a job including failure to properly manage and supervise a job could decrease the profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management  administrative salaries and benefits  marketing  communications  office and utility costs  professional fees  bad debt expense  letter of credit fees  general liability insurance and miscellaneous other expenses 
results of operations the following table sets forth the pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  and the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  this information is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed information included in the section titled unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information

the information includes such adjustments as deemed necessary to reflect the transactions in a proper manner 
this information should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto 
the unaudited pro forma information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations that we would have reported had the merger transactions been completed as of the date presented and should not be taken as representative of our future consolidated results of operations 
energy services of america corporation st pipeline  inc cj hughes pro forma combined  condensed  consolidated statement of income year ended september  unaudited energy services of america corporation st pipeline january august  st pipeline october december  st pipeline pro forma adjustments cj hughes january august  cj hughes december  cj hughes pro forma adjustments redemption adjustments pro forma combined audited audited unaudited audited unaudited unaudited contract revenues cost of revenues gross profit general and administrative expenses net income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense income before income taxes income taxes net income weighted average shares outstanding basic weighted average shares diluted net income per share basic net income per share diluted notes to pro forma income statements these adjustments represent the added depreciation created from the mark to market of the fixed assets of st pipeline million and cj hughes million as required by purchase accounting 
the added depreciation is based upon a year useful life 
these adjustments reflect the interest income lost from the cash payments made to the shareholders of st pipeline million and cj hughes million had the transaction been completed at the beginning of each period and therefore not earning interest 
the rates of interest actually received were used in the calculation 
this adjustment is to reflect the added interest cost that would have occurred relating to the million of notes at issued to the shareholders of st pipeline had the transaction been in place for the period 
st pipeline and cj hughes were both sub s corporations and therefore had no federal or state income taxes 
these entries are to reflect the estimated taxes for these companies had they been a part of energy services during the respective period 
the combined rates used were in accordance with the bylaws of energy services  shareholders had the right to vote against the transactions and request their shares be redeemed 
these entries reflect the lost interest income from the purchase of those shares so redeemed 
assuming they had been redeemed at the beginning of the period 
the interest rate used were the actual rates received by energy services during the period 
these entries are to reflect the tax savings related to the interest income lost on the payments to redeem shares 
the combined tax rate was compared to pro forma basis revenues 
revenue decreased by million or to million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily driven by the recessionary times we experienced in which lead to the company not being awarded any large projects similar in size to the ones completed in previous years 
many of our customers reduced  delayed or cancelled projects because of the uncertain economy 
costs of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased by million or to million for the year ended september  cost of revenues decreased at a smaller percentage than revenue due to losses we incurred on two major jobs 
there was a combination of events that resulted in the losses on to these jobs 
first  the customer had several other projects that were supposed to start in the quarter that they decided to delay 
the pricing had been established on these projects under the assumption of getting the added work 
when that did not occur many costs that would have been spread over all the jobs then had to be absorbed into these two existing jobs 
also  there were unplanned work stoppages initiated by the customer for the thanksgiving and christmas holidays which resulted in added payroll costs 
these jobs have been completed and since this was an unusual occurrence for portions of projects linked together to get delayed and normally when planning a project you know of scheduled work stoppages  we believe that the results of these jobs is not indicative of future performance 
gross profit 
gross profits decreased by million or for the year ended september  gross margins decreased from to 
for the year ended september  this was a result of the losses mentioned above and the decrease in volume 
the company s average gross margin runs in the twelve to fifteen percent range 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or for the year ended september  the increase was driven primarily by the addition of administrative personnel needed to support our informational and regulatory compliance needs 
income from operations 
income from operations decreased by million or for the year ended september  this decrease was due to the aforementioned reductions 
interest income 
interest income decreased  or for the year ended september  as excess cash was used to pay down long term debt 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or for the year ended september  other income 
other income decreased  or for the year ended september  this decrease was due to a reclassification of equipment rental income in to construction revenues 
net income 
net income decreased by million or to a loss of million for the year ended september  the decrease was driven by the decreases listed above 
for energy services energy services for had sales of million  a net loss of million which resulted in a loss per share of 
basic and 
fully diluted 
comparison of financial condition the company had total assets of million at september  down million from the prior fiscal year end balance 
some primary components of the balance sheet were accounts receivable which totaled million down million from the prior year end balances of the operating companies 
other major categories of assets at september  included cash of million down million from the prior year balance as well as fixed assets of million down million from prior year balance 
liabilities totaled million down from million from the prior year balance 
current maturities of long term debt was reduced by million 
this reduction was primarily due to the payment of a note to the former shareholders of one of the acquired companies for outstanding receivables collected 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by million as a result of the decrease in expenses discussed above 
income taxes payable was reduced by million due to the loss the company incurred for the period ending september  stockholders equity was million down million from prior year due to the losses sustained by the company in liquidity and capital resources cash requirements we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  which totaled million along with our credit facilities available to us and our anticipated future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient cash to meet our operating needs 
however  with the current backlog and the increased demand for our services  we could be faced with needing significant additional working capital 
we are currently working with our primary bank to ensure adequate working capital to cover our expected needs 
limited access to additional working capital could limit the company s ability to grow 
sources and uses of cash as of september   we had million in cash  working capital of million and long term debt net of current maturities of million 
the maturities of the total long term debt is as follows there after total line of credit the company entered into a fifteen million dollar  line of credit agreement with a regional bank on august  interest will accrue on the new line of credit at an annual rate based on wall street journal prime rate the index with a floor of six percent 
cash available under the line is calculated based on a percentage of the company s accounts receivable with certain exclusions 
major items excluded from calculation are receivables from bonded jobs  retainage  and items greater than one hundred twenty days old 
at september  the company had  available on the line 
a portion of the line of credit was used to repay other outstanding loan balances 
the following are the major covenants of the line current ratio must be not less than in the first year 
as of september  our current ratio was to debt to tangible net worth must not exceed during the first year 
our debt to tangible net worth at september  was to capital expenditures capex must not exceed million 
capex from the loan date was approximately  dividends shall not exceed of taxable income without prior bank approval 
no dividends have been declared 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants as of the period ending september  off balance sheet transactions due to the nature of our industry  we often enter into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
though for the most part not material in nature  some of these are leases our work often requires us to lease various facilities  equipment and vehicles 
these leases usually are short term in nature  one year or less though at times we may enter into longer term leases when warranted 
by leasing equipment  vehicles and facilities  we are able to reduce our capital outlay requirements for equipment vehicles and facilities that we may only need for short periods of time 
the company currently rents two pieces of real estate from stockholders directors of the company under long term lease agreements 
the one agreement calls for monthly rental payments of  and extends through january  the second agreement is for the company s headquarter offices and is rented from a corporation in which two of the company s directors are shareholders 
the agreement began november  and runs through with options to renew 
the second agreement calls for a monthly rental of  per month 
letters of credit certain of our customers or vendors may require letters of credit to secure payments that the vendors are making on our behalf or to secure payments to subcontractors  vendors  etc 
on various customer projects 
at september   the company was contingently liable on an irrevocable letter of credit for  to guarantee payments of insurance premiums to the group captive insurance company through which the company obtains its general liability insurance 
performance bonds some customers  particularly new ones or governmental agencies require us to post bid bonds  performance bonds and payment bonds 
these bonds are obtained through insurance carriers and guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the insurer make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the insurer for any expenses or outlays it is required to make 
depending upon the size and conditions of a particular contract  we may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the insurer 
posting of these letters or other collateral will reduce our borrowing capabilities 
historically  the company has never had a payment made by an insurer under these circumstances and does not anticipate any claims in the foreseeable future 
at september   we had million in performance bonds issued by the insurer outstanding 
concentration of credit risk in the ordinary course of business the company grants credit under normal payment terms  generally without collateral  to our customers  which include natural gas and oil companies  general contractors  and various commercial and industrial customers located within the united states 
consequently  we are subject to potential credit risk related to business and economic factors that would affect these companies 
however  we generally have certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided 
under certain circumstances such as foreclosure  we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables 
the company had only two customers that exceeded ten percent of revenues for the year ended september  this was markwest and spectra which accounted for and respectfully of revenues 
litigation the company is a party from time to time to various lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these actions typically seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personally injury  breach of contract and or property damages  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims  and proceedings  we record reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that any of these proceedings  separately or in aggregate  would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
related party transactions in the normal course of business  we enter into transactions from time to time with related parties 
these transactions typically would not be material in nature and would usually relate to real estate  vehicle or equipment rentals 
inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation during the years ended september  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results 
new accounting pronouncements during december  revised accounting standards for business combinations were promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb to become effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is prohibited 
assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations which occurred prior to the adoption of these standards should not be adjusted upon their adoption 
these standards require the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination  establishes the acquisition date as the measurement date to determine the fair value of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
as it relates to recognizing all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  costs an acquirer expects but is not obligated to incur in the future to exit an activity of an acquiree or to terminate or relocate an acquiree s employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date but must be expensed in accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting principles 
additionally  during the measurement period  which should not exceed one year from the acquisition date  any adjustments that are needed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of that date will be adjusted retrospectively 
the acquirer will be required to expense all acquisition related costs in the periods such costs are incurred other than costs to issue debt or equity securities 
these standards will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows at the date of adoption  but it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the future when it is applied to acquisitions which occur in the fiscal year beginning october  in may  the fasb established general standards of accounting for the disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
in particular  the fasb set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  and the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
this standard is effective for interim or annual periods ending after june   and is to be applied prospectively 
in june  the fasb established the accounting standards codification codification  which officially commenced july   to become the single source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive release of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other accounting literature excluded from the codification will be considered nonauthoritative 
the subsequent issuances of new standards will be in the form of accounting standards updates that will be included in the codification 
generally  the codification is not expected to change us gaap  and is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the company has adopted the codification for the quarter ending september  critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on our pro forma consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
management believes the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company and all subsidiaries file a consolidated income tax return on a fiscal year basis 
the company began filing tax returns for the year ended september  and therefore all prior company tax returns are still subject to audit 
both c j hughes and s t pipeline filed as s corporations prior to their acquisition by the company  therefore any audits of those companies tax returns would result in an adjustment to the pass through income to the shareholders at the time  and would not create any liability to the company 
the company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled 
gaap prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on a tax return 
goodwill the company has selected july as the date of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation  which is the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter 
goodwill was assigned to the operating units at the time of acquisition 
the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned are cj hughes cj and its subsidiary contractors rental corp crc as one unit  nitro electric a subsidiary of cj hughes nitro and to st pipeline 
the assignment to cj consolidated and st pipeline was based on the purchase price of each company 
both purchases were supported by fairness opinions 
the allocation of the goodwill arising from the purchase of cj was allocated between cj crc and nitro based on an internally prepared analysis of the relative fair values of each unit 
cj hughes and its subsidiary crc are considered one reporting unit because crc almost exclusively provides labor for cj as a subcontractor 
there have been no material operational changes to any reporting units since the date of acquisition 
although the company uses a centralized management approach  the reporting units have continued to perform similar services to those performed prior to the acquisition 
there have been no sales of equipment  other than in the ordinary course of business  or dispositions of lines of business by any of the operating units 
a discounted cash flow model requires estimates and judgments about such factors as the projected free cash flows  weighted average cost of capital wacc and terminal value assumptions 
projected free cash flows require assumptions about projected revenues  profitability and capital expenditures 
significant assumptions relating to the pricing multiple or market approach to value include multiples of price and enterprise value to various metrics including earnings and cash flows 
these estimates and judgments about the future can be difficult to predict with certainty  and changes in these assumptions may result in a different conclusion of fair value 
the carrying value of the reporting units at september  was relatively close to the fair value of the reporting units  since the purchase at fair value only occurred six weeks before that date 
the july  annual impairment testing indicates that the fair value of each of the operating units is at least higher than the carrying value at that date  therefore no reporting unit will be specifically addressed for more detailed disclosure at this time 
revenue recognition revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract 
these contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project 
such contracts provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate us the services rendered  measured in terms of units installed  hours expended or some other measure of progress 
contract costs include all direct material  labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  tools and expendables 
the cost estimates are based on the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  project managers and financial professionals 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and others all affect the total estimated costs at completion 
the effects of these changes are recognized in the period in which they occur 
provisions for the total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price contracts 
the current liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed price contracts 
revenue on all costs plus and time and material contracts are recognized when services are performed or when units are completed 
self insurance the company is insured at one subsidiary for general liability insurance through a captive insurance company 
while the company believes that this arrangement has been very beneficial in reducing and stabilizing insurance costs  the company does have to maintain a letter of credit to guarantee payments of premiums 
should the captive experience severe losses over an extended period  it could have a detrimental affect on the company 
current and non current accounts receivable and provision for doubtful accounts the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account is considered doubtful 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates relating to  among others  our customer s access to capital  our customer s willingness or ability to pay  general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer 
while most of our customers are large well capitalized companies  should they experience material changes in their revenues and cash flows or incur other difficulties and not be able to pay the amounts owed  this could cause reduced cash flows and losses in excess of our current reserves 
at september   the management review deemed that the allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate to cover any anticipated losses 
outlook the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
prior to the general economic crisis that severely impacted demand in  our customers were experiencing high demands for their products  particularly natural gas 
currently  we are seeing the increased demand for our services and accordingly  we would expect to see projected spending for our customers on their transmission and distribution systems increasing dramatically over the next few years 
however  with the current uncertainty in the economy the demand for the customer s project could wane and also their ability to fund planned projects could be reduced 
the company s backlog at september  was million and while adding additional business projects appears likely  no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in bidding on projects that become available 
moreover  even if the company obtains contracts  there can be no guarantee that the projects will go forward if the current economic instability continues 
if the increased demand anticipated in fiscal continues  we believe that the company will have opportunities to continue to improve both revenue volumes and the margins thereon 
however  as noted above  if the current economic conditions persist  growth could be limited 
if growth continues  we will be required to make additional capital expenditures for equipment to keep up with that need 
currently  it is anticipated that in fiscal  the company s needed capital expenditures will be between and million dollars 
however  if the customer demands continue to grow  this number could change dramatically 
significantly higher capital expenditure requirements could of course put a strain on the company s cash flows and require additional borrowings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  primarily related to increases in fuel prices and adverse changes in interest rates 
interest rate 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our borrowings from banks 
some of our loans have variable interest rates 
accordingly  as rates rise  our interest cost would rise 
we do not feel that this risk is significant
