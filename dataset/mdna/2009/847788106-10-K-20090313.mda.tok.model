item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations and financial condition as of december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
also  additional information on the company s revenues and operations can found above in business general overview and operating strategy 
the company sponsors and promotes outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things 
although the company sells a substantial number of tickets well in advance of its larger events  poor weather conditions can have a negative effect on the company s results of operations 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success of past events 
significant growth in our revenues will depend  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as further described in capital expenditures below  the company has several capital projects underway at each of its speedways 

table of contents management does not believe the company s financial performance has been materially affected by inflation  and has generally been able to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices 
results of operations the company s revenues and expenses are classified in the following categories because they are important to  and used by  management in assessing operations admissions  event related revenue  nascar broadcasting revenue  and other operating revenue 
admissions includes ticket sales for all of our events 
event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship and naming rights fees  luxury suite rentals  event souvenir merchandise sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  promotional and hospitality revenues  track rentals  driving school and karting revenues  broadcasting rights other than nascar broadcasting revenue  and other event and speedway related revenues

earnings or losses on equity investees includes the company s share of its motorsports authentics merchandising joint venture equity investee profits or losses 
the company s revenue items produce different operating margins 
broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals produce higher margins than non event merchandise sales  as well as sales of tsi  legends cars  oil chem  smi properties  bulk petroleum transactions  or other operating revenues 
the company classifies expenses to include direct expense of events  nascar purse and sanction fees  and other direct operating expense  among other categories 
direct expense of events principally includes cost of souvenir sales  non nascar race purses and sanctioning fees  property and event insurance  compensation of certain employees  advertising  sales and admission taxes  cost of driving school and karting revenues  event settlement payments to non nascar sanctioning bodies and outside event support services 
nascar purse and sanction fees includes payments to nascar for associated events held at the company s speedways

notwithstanding the various increases  management believes these revenues were negatively impacted by declines in consumer spending from higher fuel prices and difficult consumer credit and housing markets  poor weather surrounding certain nascar racing events in  and other economic factors as further described below 
almost million fans attended the company s events in  demonstrating that demand and appeal for motorsports entertainment in our markets has remained strong even in challenging circumstances 
also  televised viewership for nascar s sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series racing season increased over last year  and the sprint cup series continues as the second highest rated regular season televised sport only the national football league is higher 
also  the nascar nationwide series was the third highest rated cable broadcasted sport again in all nascar sprint cup and nationwide  and most camping world truck  event sponsorships for our racing season  and many for years beyond  are already sold 
as described below  much of our future revenues are already contracted under these and other long term contracts  including television broadcasting rights revenue 
for our upcoming major events  tickets sales at most of our speedways are below this same time last year 
we are increasing advertising and other promotional activities to help offset the ongoing impact of recessionary and other market conditions as further discussed below 
in  management is reducing many ticket and concession prices  is offering extended payment terms to many ticket buyers although generally not beyond when events are held  and is implementing various promotional campaigns to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term demand weakness 
while lower ticket prices and extended payment terms can affect operating margins and lengthen cash flow cycles as compared to historical levels  management believes these are prudent measures in the current operating environment 
however  at this early date  management is unable to determine whether event results will differ from those previously estimated 
the company believes that reduced consumer and corporate spending will continue to negatively impact admissions  sponsorship  advertising and hospitality spending  concession and souvenir sales demand  driving school and other track rentals  with related effects on our respective revenues 
many economic and geopolitical factors  including those described below and in item a risk factors  have and may continue to dampen consumer spending 
many factors related to discretionary consumer and corporate spending can adversely impact recreational and entertainment spending resulting in a negative impact on our motorsports and non motorsports activities 
historically low levels of consumer confidence  deterioration of residential real estate and mortgage markets  unprecedented stock market declines  tight consumer and business credit markets  among other ongoing recessionary conditions and geopolitical and economic factors  may continue to dampen consumer spending 
the direction and strength of the us economy  including the financial and credit markets  currently is uncertain due to these factors 
natural disasters such as hurricanes ike and gustav could cause further increases in fuel prices and significant adverse economic effects 
national incidents such as those of september   along with the iraq war and terrorism alerts  affect public concerns regarding air travel  military actions  and additional national or local catastrophic incidents 
should difficulties  restrictions or public concerns regarding air travel or military related actions continue or increase  if additional national or local terrorist  catastrophic or other incidents occur  or if natural disasters occur  our future operating results and growth could be materially 
table of contents adversely impacted 
economic conditions could be severely affected by future actual or threatened events of a similar nature or other national  regional or local incidents  which could materially adversely affect the company s future operating results 
although the company sells a substantial number of tickets well in advance of its larger events  poor weather conditions surrounding racing events can have a negative effect on successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success of past events 
these factors also can affect the financial results of present and potential sponsors of our facilities and events and of the industry 
these negative factors  particularly when combined  can impact corporate and individual customer spending  and each negative factor can have varying effects on our operating results 
all of the aforementioned factors  among others  can have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and growth 
while management believes the company s strong operating cash flow will continue  these economic and market factors  along with competitiveness of racing  popularity of drivers and teams for nascar s sprint cup series  and the success of nascar s car of tomorrow can affect ticket  corporate marketing  sponsorships and other sales 
management believes long term ticket demand  including corporate marketing and promotional spending  should continue to grow when recessionary conditions end 
certain nascar sprint cup and nationwide race team owners have recently announced difficulties in securing adequate sponsorship funding for this and possibly future racing seasons 
it is believed these difficult economic and market factors are resulting in delayed decisions on or against race team sponsorship by certain current and potential new sponsors 
without adequate sponsorship funding  some team owners could decide not to operate  participate in fewer races  or operate fewer racecars for multi car teams 
a reduced number of racing competitors  particularly popular drivers  could lessen on track competition and the appeal of racing 
also  new or changed racing teams could be formed with drivers that generate less fan interest or race less competitively 
these and similar factors can affect attendance at nascar sprint cup and nationwide racing events  as well as corporate marketing interest  that can significantly impact our operating results 
government responses and actions may or may not successfully restore stability to the credit and consumer markets  and improve economic conditions in the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that government response to the economic slow down and disruptions in the financial and credit markets will stabilize the economy or financial and credit markets 
these economic conditions might not improve or could worsen and when these conditions may ultimately improve cannot be determined at this time 
these severe economic conditions have and may further adversely impact various industries of our consumer and corporate customers  resulting in spending declines that could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be further adversely impacted by current or unforeseen economic conditions  thereby possibly having a material adverse impact on our future operating results and growth 
eight year nascar broadcasting and multi year ancillary rights agreements broadcasting revenues continue to be a significant long term revenue source for the company s core business 
a substantial portion of the company s profit growth in recent years  notwithstanding  has resulted from a significant increase in television revenues received from nascar contracts with various television networks 
nascar ratings can impact attendance at company events and sponsorship opportunities 
the former six year nascar domestic television broadcast rights agreements with nbc sports  turner sports  fox and fx expired after  and were replaced with combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed channel for the domestic broadcast rights to all nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events for through nascar announced these agreements have an approximate billion contract period value  representing approximately million in gross average annual rights fees for the industry and a increase over the former contract annual average of million 
this eight year nascar broadcasting rights arrangement provides the company with increases in annual contracted revenues through averaging per year 
the company s nascar broadcasting revenues totaled approximately million  including nhms purchased in january  and based on the current race schedule  these contracted revenues for approximate million 
the announced total nascar broadcasting rights fees for the entire industry were initially lower than the rights fees 
the company s nascar broadcasting revenues for the initial contract year were million  reflecting a decrease of approximately million or from these lower revenues were partially offset by a decrease in associated contracted nascar purse and sanction fees of approximately million or 

table of contents in  an ancillary rights package for nascar 
com  nascar radio  international and other broadcasting  nascar images  sportsvision  fanscan  specialty pay per view telecasts  and other media content distribution was reached with us  nascar and others in the motorsports industry 
nascar has announced industry wide total ancillary rights fees are estimated to approximate million over a year period 
management also believes these contracts have long term strategic benefits 
for instance  over the past several years major sports programming has begun to shift between network and cable television 
cable broadcasters can support a higher investment through subscriber fees not available to networks  which is resulting in increased rights fees for sports properties 
however  cable reaches fewer households than network broadcasts 
nascar s decision to retain approximately two thirds of its event schedule on network television is believed to be important to the sport s future growth 
the retention of both cable and network broadcasters should continue to drive increased fan and media awareness for all three nascar racing series which should help increase long term attendance and corporate marketing appeal 
management believes espn s involvement should result in the nationwide series benefiting from the improved continuity of its season long presence on espn  and motorsports in general should benefit from increased ancillary programming and nightly and weekly nascar branded programming and promotions  similar to that espn provides with the other major sports 
management believes these long term contracted revenue sources help solidify the company s financial strength  stabilize earnings and cash flows 
future changes in race schedules would impact broadcasting revenues 
similar to many televised sports  overall seasonal averages for motorsports may increase or decrease from year to year  and television ratings for certain individual events may fluctuate from year to year for any number of reasons 
while this long term rights agreement will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract period  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar may continue 
the company s share of the television broadcast revenues are contracted  and purse and sanction fees are negotiated  with nascar on an annual basis 
our long term  multi year contracted revenues are significant much of our total revenue is generated under long term contracts which management believes helps solidify our financial strength and stabilize our earnings and cash flows 
in the third year of the eight year nascar television broadcast agreement through  our contracted revenues for should approximate million 
many of our sponsorships and other corporate marketing contracts are for multiple years and also help provide revenue and other financial stability 
we believe the attractive demographics surrounding motorsports and our premier markets  where we own first class facilities  continue to provide substantial opportunities for increasing our number of longer term sponsorship partners and commitments 
for example  all nascar sprint cup and nationwide  and most camping world truck  event sponsorships for our racing season  and many for years beyond  are already sold 
we also have contracted revenues under several long term leases for various office  warehouse and industrial park space under operating leases to various entities largely involved in motorsports 
we believe the substantial amount of total revenue generated under our long term contracts  such as those described above  helps stabilize the company s financial resilience and profitability during difficult recessionary economic conditions 
non event and event souvenir and other merchandising revenues management continues to seek new merchandising opportunities  including expanded product offerings through electronic media promotional programming  and marketing of motorsports and non motorsports related souvenir merchandise at our speedways  third party speedways and other venues  and with corporate customers 
the company s merchandising event related and other operating revenues may increase or decrease depending on  among other factors  the success of such efforts 
future profits or losses could be affected by or depend on future demand  trends  prolonged recessionary and other market conditions and factors such as the success of motorsports and popularity of its licensed drivers and teams  particularly nascar s sprint cup series  the success of the car of tomorrow  and competition for the company s non event products and outside venues 
the company s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside management s control 
these revenue items may produce lower operating margins than broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals 
while our revenues may increase  there may be associated increases in receivables and inventory levels whose realization is subject to changes in market and economic conditions and other factors that 
table of contents might adversely impact realization 
such changes  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse impact on the outcome of management s realization assessment and the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on provisions reflected for receivable and inventory realization assessments

admissions for increased by million  or  over such revenue for this increase is due primarily to hosting nascar sanctioned racing events at newly acquired nhms and  to a lesser degree  an inaugural major nhra racing event at the newly constructed lms dragway

seasonality and quarterly results the company s business has been  and is expected to remain  somewhat seasonal 
concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  and the growth in the company s operations  including speedway acquisitions  with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to minimize operating income in respective future quarters 
for example  nhms purchased in january  is presently scheduled to hold one nascar sprint cup racing event in the second and third quarters each year  and operating income will likely continue to be positively impacted in those quarters and negatively impacted in the first and fourth quarters 
racing schedules may change from time to time which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of the company s motorsports business

nascar purse and sanction fees for each upcoming racing season or year are negotiated with nascar on an annual basis 
contractual cash obligations include anticipated cash payments of contracted fees as currently negotiated for those fees typically exclude an additional or approximately million of broadcasting revenues retained by nascar as a component of their sanction fees which are also included in the company s nascar purse and sanction fee expense

at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million 
while primarily representing the tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  the likely future reversal of net deferred income tax liabilities could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
accelerated income taxes of million were paid in and no such further payments are due as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company anticipates that cash from operations and funds available through the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its operating needs at least through the next twelve months  including estimated planned capital expenditures  additional repurchases of common stock  if any  income tax liabilities  payment of future dividends  if any  that may be declared  and any additional investments in or loans to its motorsports authentics joint venture

the company may  from time to time  redeem or retire its debt securities  and purchase its debt and equity securities  depending on liquidity  prevailing market conditions  and such factors as permissibility under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes  and as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the credit facility and the senior subordinated notes agreements do not restrict the ability of the company s subsidiaries to transfer  advance or dividend funds to the parent company  smi  or other subsidiaries 
while management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from the company s existing speedway operations  and has generally experienced improvement in its financial condition  liquidity and credit availability  additional liquidity and other resources could be needed to fund continued growth  including the continued expansion and improvement of the company s speedways  other facilities and ancillary businesses

the stock repurchase program is presently funded using available cash and cash equivalents 
the company repurchased  and  shares of common stock for approximately million in and million in the company could repurchase up to an additional  shares under the authorization as of december  capital expenditures management believes significant growth in the company s revenues depends  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as such  the company expects to continue to make substantial capital improvements in its facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
projects at december   the company had various construction projects underway to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and make other site improvements at its speedways 
in  lms and tms plan to modernize and expand certain camping areas  providing exclusive camping and premium seating for fans  and hospitality areas 
similar to prior years  the company continues to modernize concessions  camping  restrooms and other fan amenities 
the company also continues to improve and expand on site roads and available parking  and reconfigure traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at its speedways 
in and future years  the company may make other various improvements and renovations at lms and nhms  each of which may involve material capital expenditures over several years in amounts that have not yet been determined 
kentucky state lawmakers are considering a proposal to provide tax incentives to facilitate expansion and improvement of ks facilities within the next few years 
under the proposed legislation  qualifying projects must conduct events that are in the top league  series or sanctioned level of their type of event as defined  have not been previously held in kentucky  provide permanent seating for  spectators and be broadcast nationally  among other terms and conditions still to be negotiated and finalized 
depending on the amounts and limits of passed tax incentives  the company is contemplating expanding permanent seating at ks by  significantly modernizing and expanding concessions  camping  restrooms and other speedway facilities  and reconfiguring and expanding on site roads  available parking  traffic patterns and entrances 
the contemplated expansion and improvements may involve material capital expenditures over several years in amounts that have not yet been determined

the company also continued improving and expanding on site roads and available parking  and reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at its speedways 

table of contents although management s spending plans are being finalized  at this time  aggregate payment for capital expenditures in is estimated to approximate to million  excluding certain expenditures for ks  if any  pending possible tax incentive legislation as described above 
management plans to fund these capital expenditures with available cash and cash investments  working capital or borrowings under the credit facility as needed 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at its facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions  additional land acquisition costs  increases in the cost of construction materials and labor  unforeseen changes in design  litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site  and national or regional economic changes 
in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from estimates if assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes which  if changed  could materially adversely affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
should projects be abandoned or substantially decreased in scope due to the inability to obtain necessary permits or other unforeseen negative factors  we could be required to expense some or all previously capitalized costs which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
the company also continually evaluates new opportunities that will add value for its stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of existing legends cars and oil chem products and markets  and the expansion into new and complementary businesses 
dividends any decision concerning payment of quarterly or annual common stock dividends depends upon the company s results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  applicable limitations under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes  and other factors the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
as further described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the credit facility allows aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities of up to million each year  increasable up to million  subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
the senior subordinated notes indenture permits dividend payments each year of up to approximately per share of common stock  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants

the company plans to continue paying quarterly cash dividends subject to the limitations and considerations described in the preceding paragraph 
off balance sheet arrangements as further described in liquidity and capital resources above  as of december   the company had aggregate outstanding letters of credit of  and contingent guarantee obligations associated with an equity investment that are limited to million  decrease annually and expire through based on specified terms and conditions 
at this time  management believes the fair value of this guarantee is presently insignificant 
as further described in near term operating factors above  the credit facility provides for a separate sub limit for letters of credit of up to million for use in the company s oil and gas activities and other business transactions 
the company presently does not have any other off balance sheet arrangements including off balance sheet obligations  guarantees  commitments  or other contractual cash obligations  other commercial commitments or contingent obligations that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on its financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  including amounts that are susceptible to change 
the company continually reviews its accounting policies and accounting estimates  and the application and effect on its financial statements and disclosures  for conformity with gaap  including relevance  accuracy  completeness and non omission of material information 
the company s critical accounting policies include accounting methods and estimates underlying such financial statement preparation  as well as judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies 
in applying critical accounting policies and making estimates  materially different amounts or results could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with risk factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements  including the associated notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
as indicated below  certain accounting policies that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated are not repeated in this section 
the company believes the critical accounting policies  including amounts involving significant estimates  uncertainties and susceptibility to change  include the following the following critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements where indicated below revenue and expense recognition for racing events note accounting for nascar broadcasting revenue and purse and sanction fees note accounting for discontinued oil and gas operations  including asset impairment note accounting policies for oil and gas activities prior to discontinuing operations note revenue recognition for non event souvenir merchandise and other revenues note joint venture equity investment note accounting for share based compensation notes and fair value of financial instruments note accounting for uncertainties in income taxes under fasb interpretation no

as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets which specifies  among other things  nonamortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and expanded testing for possible impairment at least annually 
when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred  the company evaluates long lived assets  including tangible assets and intangible assets subject to amortization  for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows attributable to such assets using sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when improvement projects produce a higher economic yield and require demolition of a component of a speedway facility  capitalization of demolition  construction and historical component costs are limited to the revised estimated value of the project 
nascar has announced it would consider potential track realignment of sprint cup series racing events to desirable  potentially more profitable market venues of speedway operators 
while relocation of any sprint cup event among our speedways we now or may own in the future could result in a net increase in our future operating profitability  long lived assets of a speedway from where a sprint cup racing event may move could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our future financial condition or results of operations 
various business and other factors associated with recoverability and impairment considerations are also described in item a risk factors above 
as of december   the company s market capitalization was below its consolidated shareholder s equity 
management analyzed the difference for possible impairment as further described in note to the financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on this analysis  management believes 
table of contents the decline in the company s market capitalization below its consolidated shareholder s equity is temporary  and that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired as of december  evaluation of recoverability is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management believes no impairment of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets exists at december  however  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of impairment evaluations and the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
recoverability of equity investment in associated entity as of december   the company has an equity investment in associated entity of million 
the company follows the impairment provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock whereby declines in estimated investment fair value below carrying value assessed as other than temporary would be recognized as a charge to earnings to reduce carrying value to estimated fair value 
the company periodically evaluates for possible declines in value  and determines if declines are other than temporary  using assessment methods and factors as described in note to the consolidated financial statements joint venture equity investment 
various business and other factors associated with recoverability and impairment are also described in item a risk factors 
the company s carrying value for its ma equity investment was significantly reduced as of december  for impairment charges reflected by ma 
in  the company evaluated ma s carrying value for possible further decline and believes there was no indication of a decline in estimated fair value below ma s carrying value as of december  however  should the fair value of the company s equity investment in ma decline below its carrying value  and such decline was other than temporary  the company would be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value to fair value 
different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of impairment evaluations 
resulting impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
the company s analysis is subjective and based on assumptions  conditions and trends existing at time of evaluation 
depreciable and amortizable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the company has net property and equipment of  million and net amortizable intangible assets of million as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s property and equipment  other intangible assets and estimated useful lives 
as of december   the company has nonamortizable intangible assets of million and goodwill of million for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements that are considered to have indefinite useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation is expected to continue indefinitely 
useful lives are estimated based on outside cost segregation and valuation studies conducted on purchased or constructed speedway property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  historical experience  intended use  condition  available information for comparable assets  and other factors and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management periodically reviews the estimated useful lives used to record depreciation and amortization expense  and believes such estimated useful lives are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
management also periodically reviews whether non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets remains appropriate  and believes such non amortization is appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because the company has a material investment in depreciable property and equipment and intangible assets  changes in depreciable and amortizable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on its financial condition or future results of operations 
realization of receivables and inventories management assesses realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories 
management considers such factors  among other things  as customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience for receivables  and current inventory levels  current and future market demand  and trends and conditions for inventories 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions  including changes or deterioration in customer financial condition or merchandising distribution and other factors  that might adversely impact realization 
as further described above in item a risk factors and note to the consolidated financial statements  oil and gas transactions involve risks and other factors with respect to the realization of receivables that are different from its motorsports operations 

table of contents income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred income tax estimates  and significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities  reflect management s assessment of future taxes likely to be paid  including timing  probability of realization and other relevant factors 
management s accounting for income taxes reflects its assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
at december   net current deferred tax assets totaled million  and net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for noncurrent deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
as of december   valuation allowances of million are provided against deferred tax assets  respectively 
management has assessed deferred tax assets  after reduction for valuation allowances  and believes realization is more likely than not 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future results of operations 
the company s effective income tax rate was in compared to in as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements and below  the change was due primarily to reflecting a valuation allowance of approximately million against deferred tax assets  associated with equity investee losses of motorsports authentics because management is unable to determine that ultimate realization is more likely than not 
the company s effective income tax rates in future years may or may not be impacted by similar or other tax matters  which could result in relative increases or decreases in future income tax expense 
legal proceedings and contingencies as discussed above in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is involved in various legal matters and intends to continue to defend itself in existing legal actions in fiscal the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with its speedways  other properties and motorsports events  and other business risks 
see item a risk factors for additional information on our liability insurance program and self insurance retention 
the likelihood of an adverse outcome and estimation of amounts are assessed using legal counsel on litigation matters  outside insurance administrators and consultants for insured and self insured claims  along with historical trends  assumptions and other information available at the time of assessment 
the company accrues a liability for contingencies if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
management believes amounts requiring accrual are properly reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
management does not believe the outcome of the lawsuits  incidents or other legal or business risk matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position or results of operations 
however  new or changes in pending or threatened legal action or claims against the company  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of these matters and the company s future financial condition or results of operations

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s financial instruments and fair value information 
a change in interest rates of one percent on 
table of contents floating rate notes receivable and debt balances outstanding at december   excluding the interest rate swap  would cause an approximate change in annual interest income of  and annual interest expense of million 
interest rate swap values are affected by various market factors  including interest rate changes  which have a corresponding effect on interest expense 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above  the credit facility was amended in january which  among other things  increased the credit facility overall borrowing limit from million to million 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company uses interest rate swap agreements at times for non trading purposes to hedge interest rate risk and optimize a combination of variable and fixed interest rate debt 
the company presently has one interest rate swap transaction related to variable rate debt obligations 
the swap has a principal notional amount of million  provides for quarterly settlement and expires corresponding with the debt term 
at december  and december   the company has reflected a derivative liability for this swap of  and less than  fair value estimates are based on relevant market information at a specific point in time  and changes in assumptions or market conditions could significantly affect estimates

a portion of the marketable securities includes investments in the columbia strategic asset mutual fund of bank of america which temporarily suspended redemptions in december the fund manager has advised the company that it intends to make orderly fund liquidations with the goal of preserving and distributing as much original investment value as possible to fund investors 
approximately million or of the company s initial million investment has been returned through december   and management believes the company should substantially recover its remaining investment 
the bond market for auction rate securities has experienced difficulties caused by decreased demand  failed auctions  unusual interest rates and other challenges 
management has the ability and intends to hold these securities until the bond market recovers 
management believes that further declines  if any  in the market value of these short term investments are not likely to result in a significant loss to the company
